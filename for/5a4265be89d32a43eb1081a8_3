  I  thank  that  a  good  definition  has  been 

made by adding in Clause 2 'or a warehouse shall be inserted' , after the words 'area 

of  customs  station'.    Under  sub-section  (2)  of  the  Bill  the  'proper  officer'  has  not 

been defined. This 'proper officer' has to be defined.  In case of failure to give the 

information to the proper officer, a fine of Rs.100 for each day has been stipulated 

which  I  would  say  is  a  lesser  punishment.    A  fine  of  Rs.100  is  not  enough  and 

penalty  should  be  increased.    As  far  as  Clause  8  of  the  Central  Excise  Act  is 

concerned, after Section 3A insertion of section 3(B) (1) delegates excessive power 

and this is capable of being abused.  We are making constructive criticism on this 

Bill giving whatever suggestions we have.  We are not as such opposing the Bill.  I 

just want to clarify the situation.  Being a consequential legislation it is needed to 

be  enacted.    I  hope  that  the  hon.  Minister  of  Finance  will  take  care  of  the  points 

which I have made.  If the power vested with the Central Excise, Customs, police 

etc. is absolute, if  you give them unrestricted power, the power is supposed to be 

abused on so many collateral considerations.  Therefore, I would request the hon. 

Minister to give some safeguards in the Bill.  A safeguard should be given so that 

no officer arbitrarily exercises the power.
