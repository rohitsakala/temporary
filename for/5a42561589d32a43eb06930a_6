 I would like to say that it is a very small Bill but a very 

important Bill.  The Government is interested in changing the Bill which is placed 

before this House and the Upper House, we can find that normally it is helping all 

the corporates.  This Bill seeks to amend section 20 and 20A of the Indian Trusts 

Act, 1882  to  empower  the  Central  Government  to notify  a  class of  securities, for 

the purpose of investing trust-money.
