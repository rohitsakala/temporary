    I  have  risen  to  speak  in  favour  of  the 

Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2016.  Baba Saheb had 

talked  about  the  rights  of  SCs/STs  and  weaker  sections  of  the  society  which 

constitute  23-28  per  cent  in  the  country.    As  long  as  the  Government  keeps  the 

dalits out of the temples, keep creating false gods and exploitation continues in the 

temples,  the  poverty  cannot  be  abolished  in  India.  The  poor  has  to  be  kept  away 

from  religion  and  exploitative  system  in  the  religion  has  also  to  be  abolished.    If 

justice has to be done with the people belonging to the SCs/STs in a true manner 

then  reservation  has  to  be  implemented  in  the  judiciary  also.    Till  the  weaker 

sections,  dalits,  SCs/STs  are  not  given  50  per  cent  reservation  in  all  sort  of 

contracts and leases, their economic and social condition cannot be strengthened.
