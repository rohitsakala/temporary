      The  GST  Bill  on  compensation  law 

provides  that  the  compensation  to  States  for  loss  of  revenue  for  the  period  of 

five years will be released initially on bimonthly basis. But it is requested that 

for  the  initial  period  of  two  years,  it  should  be  released  on  monthly  basis. 

Maharashtra  has  abolished  the  Local  Body  Taxes  (LBT)  since  August,  2015. 

The  Local  Bodies  had  to  be  compensated.  For  the  year  2015-16,  the 

compensation  paid  by  the  State  is  to  the  tune  of  Rs.  3,000  crore  to  Rs.  4,000 

crore. State has been seeking to add the said amount in the base year revenue, 

2015-16. It is requested that the compensation to that extent be directly provided 

to  local  bodies  instead  of  routing  it  through  the  State.  Maharashtra  VAT  laws 

provide no turnover limit for composition amount to be paid by restaurants and 

builders. The CGST law limits it to Rs. 50 lakh only. It would result in higher 

tax load. The common man will have to pay more for his restaurants bills. It is 

requested  that  the  turnover  limit  be  increased  to  Rs. 1  crore. Maharashtra  as  a 

manufacturing State, stands to lose much of its revenue as GST is a destination 

tax.  Therefore,  loss  of  revenue  for  State  of  Maharashtra  needs  to  be 

compensated.
