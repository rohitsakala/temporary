  India  is  a  riparian  country  and  many  of  its 

cities  are  on  the  banks  of  river.    British  have  come  to  India  through  waterways.  

National Waterways was set up in 1987 but it has not been developed any further.  

We  find  NH-1, NH-2 but do  not  see  National Waterways  1, 5  or 6.   For the  first 

time we are going to have 101 new National Waterways.  The Waterway that was 

to  link  Kolkata  and  Allahabad  has  not  been  completed  as  yet.    This  Allahabad-

Haldia  Waterway  should  be  completed  as  early  as  possible.    Barges  and  boats 

which  operate  on  the  river  should  be  given  subsidies.    Without  subsidy  nothing 

much  can  be  achieved.    People  must  be  encouraged  more  and  more  to  use  the 

Waterways  and  for  that  subsidy  is  extremely  necessary.    Boatmen  should  be 

encouraged  with  subsidy.    If  that  is  done  then  the  attempt  to  develop  inland 

Waterways will be successful.
