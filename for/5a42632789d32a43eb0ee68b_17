  I  would  like  to  state  that  this  addition  of  this  PPP 

mode in the Indian Institutes of Information Technology is adding to the overall eco-

system  of  information technology  and  software services  in our  country  and  also the 

capability  for  building  human  capital  that  is  required  in  the  21st  century.    In  the 

North-Eastern  States,  the  investment  ratio  today  is  at  57.5  by  the  Central 

Government,  35  per  cent  by  the  State  Government  and  7.5  per  cent  by  the  private 

entity.    We  would  request  that  this  be  changed  to  82.5  per  cent  from  the  Central 

Government,  10  per  cent  from  the  State  Government  and  7.5  per  cent  from  the 

private entity.
