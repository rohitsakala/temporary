 In order to reduce the huge level of Non-Performing 

Assets in the banks, the Government has proposed certain amendments to make the 

process of debt recovery effective. The amendment Bill also gives more powers to 

the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  to  regulate  Asset  Reconstruction  Companies  (ARCs). 

The  amendments  proposed  by  the  Government  will  greatly  affect  the  small 

entrepreneurs  in  a  big  way.  The  proposed  Bill  does  not  address  the  issues  of  the 

MSME sector. The interest rate for the MSMEs should be less and they must also 

get purchase preference from the public sector undertakings. The MSMEs must get 

special  care  as  provided  by  the  developed  and  industrialized  countries  like  the 

USA  and  China.  The  amendments  propose  a  new  jurisdiction  in  favour  of  banks 

and  financial  institutions  by  providing  that  recovery  claims  can  be  filed  where 

branch or ‘any other office’ of the banks is functioning and maintaining an account 

in which debt claimed is outstanding. The term ‘any other office’ should be deleted 

from  the  Clause  as  it  promotes  cherry  picking  of  forums  by  banks  to  settle  their 

debt  recovery  cases.  The  Amendment  Bill  does  not  provide  for  any  measures 

which  incentivise  the  ARCs  to  expedite  the  restructuring  efforts.  Banks  should 

follow the due process of law while recovering their dues and unwarranted muscle 

power should not be used.
