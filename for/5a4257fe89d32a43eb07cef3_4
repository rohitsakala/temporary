 The main objective of this Bill is to 

set up  commercial  courts  which  would  give  impetus  to  the  economic  growth  and 

would also enhance the international image of the Indian Judicial system.  Today, 

at  least  20,000  commercial  disputes  are  pending  in  various  High  Courts  of  the 

country.    Those  who  had  invested,  have  tired.    Therefore,  there  is  need  to  set  up 

more courts and judges should be appointed in the required numbers.  At least 30-

40 percent post of judges are lying vacant in the courts.  I would like to request the 

hon. Minister  of  Law  and  Justice  and  hon. Minister  of  Parliamentary  Affairs  that 

Bombay became Mumbai and Madras became Chennai but the name of State High 

Courts  still  continues  to  be  Bombay  High  Court  and  Madras  High  Court.    An 

Assurance  was  given  to  change  their  nomenclature.    Therefore,  a  Bill  should  be 

introduced  in  this  session  itself  to  rechristen  there  High  Courts  as  Mumbai  High 

Court and Chennai High Court.
