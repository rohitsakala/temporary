 Today, the life of the innocent children is 

not mired into child labour only, child trafficking and discrimination with girls has 

also  become  a  major  problem  in  the  country.    Children  are  still  not  getting  their 

entire  rights.    As  per  the  government  data,  more  than  60  thousand  children  go 

missing  every  year.    These  missing  children  are  forced  into  child  trafficking, 

bonded labour and begging, human organ trade etc. Children are sold on exorbitant 

prices  for  these  trades.    Child  labour  has  become  a  major  social  and  economic 

problem across the world.  In country like India where more than 40 per cent of the 

population  is  living  under  poverty,  child  labour  is  such  a  social  bane  which 

hampers  the  development  of  children.   It also  impedes  the  future  development of 

the country.  I support the Bill that has been introduced by our Government.  This 

Bill  is important to save childhood.
