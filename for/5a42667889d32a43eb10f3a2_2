    The  Rights  of  Persons  with  Disabilities  Bill, 

2016 is a very good Bill.  The number of disabled in the country is between 7 to 10 

crore  and  this  Bill  has  been  introduced  today  in  the  Lok  Sabha  for  the  benefit  of 

them.    This  Bill  would  prove  a  major  mile-stone  in  enhancing  the  self  respect  of 

the disabled persons in the coming time.  All provisions have been provided in this 

Bill to ensure the rights for disabled persons to enable them to lead an equal life in 

society.  It has also been ensured in the Bill that the rights of such persons are not 

violated  by  any  person  or  any  institute.    A  provision  of  providing  four  per  cent 

reservation for them in educational institutions has also been made.  A provision is 

also  there  in  the  Bill  to  hone  up  their  skill  as  per  their  talent  to  make  them 

economically independent.  The issues relating to their social security, health and 

rehabilitation have also been taken due care of in the Bill.  Provision for their legal 

safety  is  also  there  in  the  Bill.    Finally,  it  is  also  ensured  that  no  atrocities  are 

committed against them and justice is meted out to them.
