  I  am  on  my  legs  to  support  this  Bill.  

But  we  have  taken  as  many  as  17  years  to  introduce  this  Bill  after  Kandhar 

incident.    The  forces  should  be  developed  on  the  lines  of  USA  and  the  UK  who 

should invariably be capable of tackling all the security issues of aircrafts.  This is 

necessary  also  for  providing  security  to  our  airports  on  the  professional  lines.  

Moreover,  the judges and the ministers should also be brought under the purview 

of security checks.  I would also like to urge upon the hon. Minister that aviation 

industry should not be privatized as it may put our security in jeopardy.
