  I  request  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to 

provide  an  enhanced  budget  at  the  Revised  Budget  stage  in  addition  to  the  earlier 

allocation  (BE)  of  Rs.  5400  crore  so  that  the  vital  schemes  /  programmes  under 

HUPA  may  not  suffer  for  want  of  required  funds.  As  per  the  Poverty  Estimates 

2011-12, the number of persons living below poverty line in urban areas in 2011-12 

was  531.25  lakhs.  Deendayal  Antyodaya  Yojana  (Urban)  and  Swarna  Jayanti 

Shahari Rozgar Yojana like poverty alleviation schemes are also going to be affected 

due  to  lack  of  fund.  It  is  high  time  that  the  Central  government  to  launch  an 

exclusive  scheme  for  the  homeless  so  that  they  could  lead  a  more  dignified  and 

secure life. There  are  over 2.5 lakh houses  lying vacant  across  India. The low-cost 

houses  have  been  constructed  under  different  urban  housing  schemes  sanctioned 

under  Jawaharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM)  and  Rajiv 

Awas Yojana (RAY). The Government needs to look into this matter and focus on 

proper  allocation  of  houses  to  the  beneficiaries.  I  also  urge  the  Government  to 

increase  the  funds  for  various  schemes  and  allocations  to  States  and  Union 

Territories so that we could improve the standard of living of those who are poor and 

homeless.
