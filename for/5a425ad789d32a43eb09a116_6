 We want that benami transactions in 

the  case  of  property  should  be  totally  stopped  in  our  country.    We  think  some 

loopholes  are  still  there  in  the  Act.    Establishing  adjudicating  authorities  and 

appellate tribunals to deal with benami transactions and specifying the penalties for 

entering  into  benami  transactions  are  good  intensions.    Had  the  loopholes  in  the 

Income Tax Act, 1961 been plugged, we would not need a new Bill.  Sometimes, 

an  individual  can  purchase  land  for  the  sake  of  the  family  and  he  may  sincerely, 

honestly  gift  it  to  other  persons.    In  that  case,  what  would  happen  has  not  been 

described in the amendments.  This loophole should be plugged.  It is stated in the 

Bill  that  the  confiscated  properties  will  be  vested  with  the  Central  Government. 

That should go to the concerned State Government.  For initiating and completion 

of the cases, there should be a fixed time limit.  For furnishing information about 

land, only 30 days time has been given.  I think this can be extended.  It should be 

integrated with Aadhaar or PAN card.  Benami transactions are taking place only 

to create black money, to keep the black money, for political purposes and also for 

creating  election  fund  of  political  parties.    If  the  political  parties  and  political 

leaders keep away from benami transactions and not use black money for political 

purposes, then only  benami  transactions can be stopped in  this  country.  We  hope 

that this Bill becomes a very strong law.
