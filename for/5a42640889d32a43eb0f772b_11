  The  Government  should 

publish  the  report  of  case-based  census.  The  Government  should  not  fiddle  with 

the list of OBCs.  The powers of state governments are being taken away and this 

Bill is likely to prove very dangerous.  I have proposed three amendments to this 

Bill which should be accepted in toto otherwise this Bill will prove very dangerous 

for  the  backward  sections  of  the  society.    The  Government  is  trying  to  exclude 

certain castes from the list.  If the Government includes certain castes in the list of 

OBCs  by  excluding  some  existing  ones  in  the  name  of  according  constitutional 

status to the Commission, it will not be tolerated.    

 

THE  MINISTER  OF  STATE  IN  THE  MINISTRY  OF  HUMAN 

RESOURCE  DEVELOPMENT  (SHRI  UPENDRA  KUSHWAHA):    I,  on 

behalf  of  my  party,  thank  the  hon.  Prime  Minister  and  the  hon.  Minister  for 

according constitutional status to OBC Commission.  If possible, the provision of 

creamy  layer  should  be  done  away  with  completely  otherwise  the  limit  of  Rs.6 

lakh should be enhanced.  Number of castes in the list of OBCs is increasing but 

the quota is intact at 27 per cent.  This quota of 27 per cent should be enhanced.  

OBCs  don't  have  any  representation  in  judiciary.    They  should  be  given 

representation  there.    The  media  which  is  known  as  the  fourth  estate  has  been 

growing  its  role  all  the  time.    OBCs  do  not  have  any  representation  there.  

Therefore, there  is  a  need  to  ensure  the  representation  of  OBC  people  there  also.  

Today  the  number  of  jobs  are  increasing  in  private  sector.    OBCs  should  find 

representation  there  also.    The  report  of  socio-economic  census  should  be  made 

public.
