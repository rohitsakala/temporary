 I fully support the Government as far 

as the intention of the Bill is concerned.  The intention of the Bill is to address the 

issue of the stressed assets.  The present situation is that we have Rs. 8 lakh crore 

of stressed assets.  The question which I would like to pose before the hon. Finance 

Minister  is  as  to  who  are  the  real  defaulters  contributing  to  these  huge  non-

performing  assets  in  our  country.    Kindly  see  that  bad  loans  in  the  banks  are 

increasing  day  by  day.    The  hon.  Finance  Minster  recently  stated  that  there  are 

7,000 wilful defaulters.  That will come around Rs.76,000 crore as the amount of 

willful  defaulters.    My  question  to  the  hon.  Minister  is  that  willful  defaulters 

should be treated as criminal offenders.  It is because they are cheating the country.  

Statistics of realisation of loans through DRTs is not satisfactory.  The functioning 

of  DRTs  and  DRATs  have  to  be  reviewed.    The  point  which  I  would  like  to 

highlight  is  that  legislations  are  not  sufficient  to  meet  the  situation.    The 

Government  should  have  the  will  power,  especially  political  will,  to  control  and 

check  the  NPAs,  especially  those  created  by  the  rich  and  the  corporate  entities.  

The  law  is  being  applied  against  farmers,  students,  MSME  loans,  housing  loans 

etc.    They  should  be  applied  against  the  rich  and  the  corporate  entities.    I  would 

like  to  know  from  the  ho.  Minster  whether  a  list  of  willful  defaulters  will  be 

published and whether he will have the will power to control and check corruption 

as also contain NPAs by addressing them.
