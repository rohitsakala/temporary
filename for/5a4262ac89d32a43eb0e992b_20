  All  inter-State  rivers  should  be  nationalized 

so that water resources of the counter are optimally utilized.  The Cauvery River is 

the lifeline of Tamil Nadu.  The scheme for modernization of the canal system in 

the  Cauvery  basin  at  a  cost  of  Rs.  11,421  crore  may  be  accorded  approval  at  the 

earliest.    I  would  urge  the  Government  to  allocate  the  requested  funds  at  the 

earliest  for  the  speedy  implementation  of  the  Grand  Anicut  Canal  Project.    The 

hon.  Chief  Minister  Puratchi  Thalaivi  Amma,  had  sought  the  assistance  of  the 

Union Government for the early implementation of the proposal to divert the flood 

waters of the river Cauvery to drought-prone areas by linking the rivers Cauvery, 

Vaigai and Gundar at a cost of Rs. 5,166 crore.  I would urge upon the Government 

to expedite the implementation of the interlinking of peninsular rivers.
