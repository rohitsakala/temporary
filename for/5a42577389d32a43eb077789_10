    I  rise  to  support  this  Bill.    In  recent  years, 

technical education has seen an exponential growth in India.  Excellent Institutes 

and higher education centres which previously were 4 per cent have in the past 2 

and  half  years  increased  by  14  per  cent  due  to  the  efforts  of  the  Central 

Government and the hon. Minister.  It is the vision of the hon. Prime Minister that 

by 2030 India should become the top nation with skilled manpower.  The standard 

of education has fallen drastically in villages.  If the students are imparted standard 

education  at  the  primary  level  then  they  would  become  the  future  of  the  nation.  

Private education has left the government education behind.  Students in villages 

do  not  have  textbooks.    There  are  no  toilets  in  schools,  drinking  water  and 

electricity.    The  vision  of  our  government  is  to  make  India  a  developed  country, 

the credit for which goes to the Prime Minister.  The Government under National 

Super Computer Mission propose to set up 70 National Super Computer Centres.  

My request is that such a centre should be set up in Rajasthan also.  I request the 

Minister  to  sanction  the  proposal  of  the  Rajasthan  Government  regarding  model 

colleges to provide free education to the children and to increase its standard.  In 

Sriganganagar  1000  acre  central  farm  is  available  for  national  institute.    If  the 

Government sanctions a institute for Sriganganagar then the children would have a 

bright future.
