  I would like to thank the hon. Minister 

that he has declared 106 waterways by adding 101 new waterways.  This mode of 

transportation is only going to prove beneficial.  It is a cheap and convenient mode 

of  transport,  environment-friendly  and  employment  oriented.    This  will  give  us 

freedom  from  traffic jams  and it  will also give  a  boost to the  tourism.   There  are 

rivers like Kosi and Gandak in north Bihar which have sufficient quantity of water 

throughout the year.  The use of these rivers in developing the waterways can be 

very  economical  and  effective.    I  would  like  to  tell  that  river  Punpun  falls  in  my 

parliamentary constituency.  The hon. Minister is talking about developing 35 km 

flow of this river as waterways.  I would like suggest that the waterway should be 

increased upto the level of the origin of the river or to any feasible point.  Besides,  

there is a mention of developing waterway upto 160 km in river Son.  This should 

also be increased.
