  I  would  like  to  put  forward  a  few  humble  demands  of 

mine to the Central Government. As we all are aware, the rainy season is going on 

now.  So,  seeds  should  be  given  to  the  farmers  during  this  season.  Secondly, 

fertilizers should be given to the poor farmers. Thirdly, loans which were already 

given to the poor farmers should be waived.
