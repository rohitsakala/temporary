  As  per  the  first  reading  of  the  Bill, 

Rule  75(1)  gives  authority,  empowers  the  Members  to  have  a  discussion  on  the 

principles  of  the  Bill.    Unfortunately,  I  may  repeat  that  this  Bill  was  circulated 

today  by  9.00  O'clock  in  the  morning  when  I  was  coming  to  the  Parliament.   An  

hon. Member has rightly said that we are not in a position to have a look into the 

Bill and, therefore, we are not able to discuss the principles of the Bill as per the 

Rule 75(1). Under these circumstances, I oppose this move of the Government. 

 

THE  MINISTER  OF  STATE 

IN  THE  MINISTRY  OF 

AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE AND MINISTER OF STATE 

IN  THE  MINISTRY  OF  PARLIAMENTARY  AFFAIRS  (SHRI  S.S. 

AHLUWALIA)  responding  to  the  issue  raised  by  several  hon.  Members,  said: 

Hon. Members raised certain issues about the formation of the Joint Committee on 

a  particular  Bill.    Hon.  Members  raised  a  point  that  it  can  be  referred  to  the 

Standing  Committee  also.    Then,  he  has  shown  that  the  Government  is 

apprehensive of something.  He is talking about some hidden agenda.  The agenda 

is very clear that when we are talking about bringing legislation in the country, we 

are  bringing  new  legislations  for  future  generation  and  these  are  new  generation 

future  laws.  This  law  is  also  a  new  law.    Rather  he  should  feel  happy  that  a 

Government Bill, which has been introduced and referred to the Joint Committee, 

now he has got the power to change the total character of the Bill.  It is because the 

recommendations  of  the  Departmentally  Related  Standing  Committees  are  not 

mandatory.  But, here it is mandatory.  Here, your recommendations are mandatory 

in  nature  and  ultimately, 

the  Government 

is  bound 

to  accept 

those 

recommendations.  

The motion was adopted.
