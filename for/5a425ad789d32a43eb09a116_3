 The Bill which has come up is the Benami 

Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Bill, 2015.  The Government could bring a 

new  Bill.  The  Standing  Committee  of  Finance  in  Part-II  of  its  28th  Report  had 

recommended  for  bringing  a  new  Bill.    There  will  be  problem  in  appointing  the 

Chairman of the Adjudicating Authority because the Bill says that the senior most 

member will be the chairman and seniority of officers belonging to different cadres 

cannot  be  compared.    I  fail  to  find  a  point  in  including  Department  of  Revenue 

everywhere.  The Bill proposes to create an appellate tribunal but I would like to 

ask  where  the  provision  for  preferring  an  appeal  is.    If  an  order  is  passed  by  the 

Adjudicating  Authority,  power  should  be  given  to  the  Appellate  Tribunal  to  pass 

an  interlocutory  order.    It  should  be  ensured  that  a  person  gets  justice.    In  rural 

areas and in case of illiterate persons it is very difficult to find the land deeds etc.  

In their  cases if the deeds are not  available, then  care  should be taken to  see that 

those  properties  are  not  brought  within  the  scope  and  ambit  of  this  Act.    If  the 

property is not bought by tainted money, or money from undisclosed sources, then 

those  properties  should  not  be  brought  within  the  scope  and  ambit  of  this  Act.  

Except  certain  points  which  I  have  already  pointed  out,  I  appreciate  the 

mechanisms that has been created through this Bill.
