 This Bill ensures registration and 

accountability  of  property  promoters,  buyers  and  agents.    The  Bill  provides  to 

maintain  separate  bank  account  and  the  entire  amount  must  only  be  used  for  the 

construction  of  that  project.    This  Bill  provides  to  make  all  transactions 

transparent.  Establishment of appellate tribunal is also there in this Bill.  All these 

things  are  excellent  as  far  as  this  Bill  is  concerned.    On  the  one  hand  State 

legislations  are  there  and  now  the  Central  legislations  are  going  to  be  made.    I 

would  like  to  know  as  to  how  the  Government  is  going  to  address  the 

contradiction, if any, between the State legislation and the Central legislation.  The 

escalation  cost,  arising  out  of  delays  in  various  stages  such  as  clearance  of  land 

titles, approval from revenue authorities and plan approval from local bodies,  etc. 

is  another  problem.    There  are  certain  other  problems  like  that  which  may  also 

kindly be addressed.  As far as the regulatory body is concerned, I suggest that a 

representative  of  the  local  body  may  also  be  included  in  that.    The  Standing 

Committee's recommendations are vital.  The Bill should regulate commercial and 

industrial real estate as well.  The exclusion of projects smaller than 1000 square 

meter or 12 apartments from the purview of the RERA could lead to exclusion of a 

large  number  of  small  housing  projects.    Single  window  system  should  be 

introduced for clearance of various projects. With regard to the definition of carpet, 

area, the recommendations of the Standing Committee are so vital.
