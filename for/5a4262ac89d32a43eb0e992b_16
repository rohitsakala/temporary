  While on one hand this Bill is certainly going 

to boost to the trade, on the other it will also result in creation of a lot of facilities 

from the point of view of tourism, transportation and protection of environment.  I 

would  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  House  towards  my  constituency.    A 

waterway  has  been  declared  at  point  No.  40  which  will  originate  at  Faizabad 

starting from river Ghaggar, further going through river Ganga and reaching upto 

the confluence of river Ghaggar.  I would like to request the hon. Minister that the 

waterway  which  he  wants  to  start  from  Faizabad,  should  be  started  from 

Lakhimpur because the construction of a border road along that waterway has been 

announced.  This will pave the way for this national waterway to take the shape of 

international waterway.
