  A  special  package  for  drought  affected 

farmers  of southern part of the country should have been given.  We welcome the 

announcement  of  Mission  Antyodaya  which  is  directed  at  lifting  1  crore  families 

out  of  poverty.    Lack  of  policies  or  clarity  on  agriculture  planning  has  led  to 

decline in pulse production.   The Amma Canteen Scheme has a salutary impact on 

keeping a check on food prices in Tamil Nadu.  I urge the Union Government to 

take  all  possible  steps  to  improve  the  socio  economic  status  of  farmers  in  the 

country  and  make  them  happy  to  continue  with  agriculture  and  farming  to  make 

our country self sufficient in agriculture and its related fields.  

 

SHRI  G.  HARI:  I  urge  the  Union  Finance  Minister  to  ensure  that 

Commercial  Banks  in  particular  lend  more  against  land  and  cultivation  related 

documents and not as jewel loans, so that the availment of agriculture insurance is 

also simultaneously enhanced.  I would like to confine myself with the Fishermen 

welfare and fishing needs of Tamil Nadu fishing community to harness good reap 

and development in Fishing Industry in Tamil Nadu.  The Comprehensive Special 

Package  of  Rs.1520  crores  for  Diversification  of  Fisheries  with  a  Rs.10  crores 

recurring  component  may  be  approved  at  the  earliest.    I  request  the  Union 

Government to release the balance funds under the Centrally  Sponsored Schemes 

for construction of Fishing Harbours in Tamil Nadu immediately.  I urge the Union 

Government  to  create  a  separate  Ministry  for  Fishermen  welfare  and  take  all 

necessary steps to make fishing a flourishing occupation in the country.
