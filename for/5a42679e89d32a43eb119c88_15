    I  extend  my  support  to  the 

National  Bank  for  Agriculture  And  Rural  Development  Bill.  NABARD  has  been 

providing  credit  to  the  small  scale  industries,  cotton  industries,  village  industries 

which have now grown as micro enterprises, small enterprises, medium enterprises 

and  cotton  enterprises.  In  Assam,  NABARD  could  significantly  contribute  to  the 

development  of  marginal  and  small  farmer  population  which  would  be  benefited 

more from NABARD in comparison to the banks. However, one experiences lot of 

difficulties in getting sanction for the NABARD schemes. The schemes being run 

for  the  development  of  rural  economy,  small  and  marginal  farmers,  small  scale 

industries  and  village  handloom  industries  should  be  thoroughly  monitored.  The 

state  youth  have  taken  to  extremism  as  a  result  of  growing  unemployment  in 

Assam.  The  Government  through  NABARD  has  evolved  schemes  to  ensure  job 

security  and  life  security  to  the  youth  to  enable  them  to  plan  for  their  future. 

Venturing  more  capital  in  Dairy  farming  and  other  small  scale  industries  would 

give  more  boost  to  these  industries.  The  functioning  of  the  banking  sector  and 

functioning  in  the  rural  areas  should  be  monitored.  NABARD  basically  provides 

loans to the financial institutions of the Government. It should be more prompt and 

should  be  monitored  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance.    There  is  no  system  of  double 

cropping  in  Assam.  Irrigation  and  other  facilities  should  be  provided  there. 

NABARD should work on it.
