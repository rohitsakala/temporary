 We have supported this Bill unanimously in 

the  JPC  and  I  belive  that  this  august  House  will  also  pass  it  unanimously.  

Definitely,  this  Bill  is  going  to  be  a  landmark  in  bringing  economic  reforms, 

reducing  NPAs  in  banks  and  recovery  of  debts  in  our  country.    As  on  september 

1990, there were more than 15 lakh cases of bad debts in our country in which Rs. 

6013 crore  were involved.  Before 1993 banks had no right to recover loan from a 

willful  defaulter.      In  these  circumstances,  RDDBFI  Act  was  brought  in  1993.  

After  the  implementation  of  this  Act  DRTs  were  created.      Still  there  are  70-72 

thousand  cases  pending  in  various  DRTs.    We  are  bringing  amendments  in  four 

Acts  through  this  Bill  under  which  RDDBFI  Act  is  also  being  amended  under 

which  certain  restrictions  have  been  imposed.    Similarly,  investment  process  of 

ARCs have been relaxed and process of creation of  ARCs  have also been relaxed. 

In this Bill, as far as the question of jurisdiction is concerned, the borrowers or the 

willful defaulters had to file their applications in the DRT of the area where they 

were  residing,  but  now  the  creditors  can  file  their  cases  in  the  DRT  of  the  area 

where  their  accounts  or  their  branches  of  Bank  exist.    At  the  same  time,  the 

definition  of  debt  has  been  widened  in  order  to  make  the  recovery  process  faster 

and  comprehensive.    Moreover,  the  integration  of  property  registration  will 

facilitate the lenders to check the title of the property which has been mortgaged.
