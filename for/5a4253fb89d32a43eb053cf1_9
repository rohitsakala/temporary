  India and Bangladesh signed Indira-Mujib 

agreement in 1974.  We took 41 years to bring this issue to parliament and settle it 

whereas Bangladesh ratified it in 1974 itself.  The Ministry of External Affairs has 

taken the initiative in the able leadership of the hon. Minister of External Affairs to 

achieve  this  result.    India  and  Bangladesh  do  not  have  many  disputes  one  was  3 

Bigha  corridor  issue  which  was  resolved  in  June  1992.    We  want  good  relations 

with our neighbours.  We should have increased border trade right from Tripura to 

entire  North-East.    We  need  to  increase  regional  cooperation.    Presently,  there  is 

bombarding in many countries in Asia.  In such a time, we are doing an agreement 

between  the  two  countries  and  our  Parliament  is  passing  it.    This  is  an  example 

before  the  world  people  mistake  human  problems  for  land  problems.    But  the 

people in  enclaves had  many  issues relating  to  agriculture, livelihood, healthcare, 

law  and  order  and  education.    Now  they  will  get  rid  of  these  problems.    This  is 

only a beginning not an end.  It is a reality that India had a partition.  There is not 

point of return on it.  But we can live as good neighbours with other countries.
