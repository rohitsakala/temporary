  After  the  coming  of  the  present 

government agricultural production in the country increased.  In my parliamentary 

constituency,  huge  amount  has  accrued  through  agriculture  insurance.    I  have 

donated  about  Rs.  2.5  crores  from  MPLAD  scheme  for  Jal  Yukta  Shivir.    The 

central  government  has  provided  huge  funds  to  Maharashtra  for  agricultural 

development  and  welfare  of  the  farmers.    Another  important  step  taken  by  the 

Union  Government  is  the  starting  of  soil  analysis  for  the  farmers.    I  request  the 

Union  Government  to  procure  all  the  toor  dal  produced  in  my  constituency  at  a 

good  price.    Because  of  lack  of  warehouses  toor  dal  is  kept  in  the  open.    The 

government  should  find  ways  to  prevent  it  being  damaged.    I  support  these 

demands for grants.
