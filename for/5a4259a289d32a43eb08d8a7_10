  The  foremost  requirement 

for nation building is the building of our character and we not only have to build 

our characters but also have to ensure that we remain healthy.  We have to create 

awareness everywhere right from the schools to all other places.  There is a need to 

open  Health  Centres  for  addressing  the  problem  of  malnutrition.    I  would  like  to 

say  that  this  Bill  is  very  good  beginning  to  ensure  that  we  remain  healthy.    The 

Government has expressed its concern over this major problem and the House has 

shown its solidarity in sharing the concern.
