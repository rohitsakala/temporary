    In  the  guidelines  of  Pradhan  Mantri  Awas 

Yojana, there  are  four  verticals  namely  the  availability  of  land, the  involvement  of 

the private sector, capacity of the person to take a loan and then repay that loan.  So 

the Housing for all seems to be a pipe dream due to such pre-requisites.  I want to 

emphasize that if you really want to provide housing to all, you should work towards 

your policy to actually make the housing affordable.
