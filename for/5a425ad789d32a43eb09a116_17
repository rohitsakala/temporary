 The Bill, which is lying dormant for 27 

years, has been brought today for the introduction and also to pass. This shows the 

will of the Government.  I would like to stress only on two or three points.  This 

Bill  has  been  brought  to  eradicate  benami  transactions.    But  here  everybody  has 

mentioned about property only whereas there are many assets a person can create 

through benami transactions.  Secondly, in any case, executor and judge cannot be 

the  same  person.    Similarly,  in  the  matter  of  benami  transactions  one  can  appeal 

from  appellate  tribunal  to  High  Court  and  Supreme  Court  also.      Sometimes,  it 

takes a long period of 30 to 40 years to dispose of the cases.  It is my request that 

there should be a time limit.  There should be provision of providing incentives in 

this Bill if a property worth 100 crore rupees is revealed then it would be better to 

provide  10  to  20  per  cent  incentives  in  this  case.    Apart  from  this  Geo  tagging 

should  also  be  completed.    At  last,  I  would  like  to  say  that  honest  should  be 

protected and those who are guilty must be punished.
