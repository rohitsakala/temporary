  NABARD  is  one  of  the  premier  financial  institution  in  the 

country.    It  was  founded  in  the  year  1982.    NABARD  provides  loans  and 

refinancing  facilities  to  the  agriculture,  cottage  industries,  rural  industries, 

handicrafts  and  small  industries.    After  the  assumption  of  power  by  our 

Government, the refinancing and direct loan providing activities to agriculture and 

rural  development  sectors  by  NABARD  have  undergone  a  very  comprehensive 

expansion  during  the  last  few  years  which  has  been  done  keeping  in  consonance 

with the policy and priorities of the institution.  To further underline the point the 

balance sheet of NABARD  was 1 lakh 82 thousand crore as on 31 March, 2012.  It 

has increased to Rs. 3 lakh 10 thousand crore as on 31 March, 2016 which means 

that activities of NABARD has increased by 70 per cent during this short period.  

We  all  are  aware  of  the  suggestion  by  the  hon.  Prime  Minister  of  doubling  the 

income of the farmers by 2022.  Our efforts are also directed towards creating rural 

infrastructure.  Keeping these objectives in mind, I am presenting before the House 

this  NABARD  Amendment  Bill,  2017.    The  present  authorized  capital  of 

NABARD  is  Rs.5000  crore  which  is  proposed  to  be  increased  upto  Rs.  30,000 

crore by this Amendment.  At present, the Central Government owns 99.6 per cent 

share holding of NABARD and RBI owns only 0.4 per cent.  This ownership also 

creates a conflict of interest in the role of RBI.  As RBI is also the regulator, hence, 

the  present  equity  of  0.4  per  cent  owned  by  it  would  also  be  transferred  to  the 

Central  Government resulting  in 100 per cent  share holding  into the hands of the 

Government  of  India.    Besides,  some  of  the  Amendments  are  of  consequential 

nature.
