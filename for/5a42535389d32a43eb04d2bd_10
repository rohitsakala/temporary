  We  appreciate  the  concern  and  commitment  of 

Government  to  keep  the  price  rise  under  control.  Modi  Sarkar  has  successfully 

controlled  the  inflation  in  the  last  two  years.  The  lower  production  of  pulses  and 

increase in consumptions resulted into upward trend of prices of pulses since last 

several  years.  The  BJP  Government  has  enacted  a  long  term  plan  towards  the 

support and incentive to the farmers, for more the more production of pulses.
