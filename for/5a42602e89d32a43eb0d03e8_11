  This Bill is very important in the interest of our 

country.  All the Members of Parliament from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana state 

have been raising this issue since last three years and I am glad that this Bill will be 

passed today.  But after the Bill is passed, it's implementation depends heavily on 

the    bureaucracy  which  style  of  functioning  has  turned  obsolete  and  due  to  this 

reason    people  do  not  get  desired  benefits  even  after  the  passing  of  Bill  in  the 

Parliament.  So I would like to request that certain mechanism should be placed to 

evolve an accountability system pertaining to the Bills passed in the Parliament so 

as to monitor the number and timings of applications received by the bureaucracy 

along with the time taken in the disposal of those applications.   This will benefit 

the people of our country in a big manner.  So it is my request to the Government 

to issue an order through a circular in this regard.   

 

DR.  RATNA  DE  (NAG):  I  would  request  the  Government  to  set  up  an 

Indian  Institute  of  Information  Technology  Design  and  Manufacturing  in  my 

parliamentary constituency which includes, Singur.  Declaring existing institutions 

as  the  institution  of  national  importance  is  welcome  but  it  should  be  done  with  a 

noble  vision  of  spreading  knowledge  and  information  to  all  parts  of  the  country 

and  to  be  vested  with  the  best  of  infrastructure  like  labs,  paraphernalia,  faculty.  

Only then declaring existing universities and institutions as institutions of national 

importance would serve the purpose.
