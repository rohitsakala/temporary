    Hon.  Members  would  recall  that  during  the  last  year 

when  similar  objections  were  raised  at  the  time  of  consideration  of  the  Finance 

Bill, 2016, I had observed that as per rule 219, the primary object of a Finance Bill 

is  to  give  effect  to  the  financial  proposals  of  the  Government.  There  is  no  doubt 

about it.  At the same time, this Rule does not rule out the possibility of inclusion 

of non-taxation proposals.  Therefore, I have accepted this.  The Finance Bill may 

contain non-taxation proposals also.    Now  another  thing  is  no  doubt  every  effort 

should  be  made  to  separate  taxation  measures  from  other  matters.    It  should  be 

done.  But as has been very widely explained by the Finance Minister I did not say 

the  thing  again  and  again.    So  incidental  provisions  can  be  made  that  is  why 

keeping  in  view  that  rule  219  does  not  specifically  bar  inclusion  of  non-taxation 

proposals in a Finance Bill, I rule out the Point of Order.
