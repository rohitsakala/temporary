  Through  this  Bill,  the  Government  is 

giving  two  years  extension  to  those  teachers  who  do  not  posses  minimum 

educational  qualification.    The  Sanskrit  teachers  possessing  Shashtri  degrees  are 

also being given the opportunity to acquire the minimum essential qualification.  I 

would like to ask the hon. Minister as to whether we have been able to implement 

the RTE Act.  There is no regular computer teacher in the entire State of Haryana.  

How would we able to materialize the dream of Digital India?  Unless we are able 

to develop the infrastructure from qualitative point of view, we will not be able to 

implement  the  RTE  Act.    Haryana  Government  has  got  the  Director  of  Higher 

Education issue a notification barring the students who do not study in a school for 

700 days.  There are thousands of students whose forms are not being accepted.  I 

would  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  kindly  speak  to  the  State  Government  so  that 

such children could get admission in college.
