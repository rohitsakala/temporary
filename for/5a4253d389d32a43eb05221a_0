 India has a 

coastline  of  7500  kms.    Our  ports  have  been  handling  the  cargo  for  the  time 

immemorial.   Today,  we  have 12  major  ports and 205  minor  ports, which  handle 

95 per cent of the cargo in terms of volume and 68 per cent in terms of value which 

is a statement on the importance of our ports in our EXIM trade.  Today, the cargo 

and maritime trade has been increasing and our maritime laws are of British origin 

which  are  still  extant.    We  have  brought  this  Bill  to  amend  the  old  laws  and 

substitute them  with the domestic laws.  The laws  enacted  by  the Britishers  were 

enacted  at  a  time  when  our  country  had  only  three  major  ports  namely,  Mumbai, 

Madras and Kolkata ports.  Even today any  maritime dispute has to be  settled by 

three  High  Courts  only.    As  the  coastal  and  maritime  trade  has  expanded  a  lot 

accompanied by the construction of new ports in almost all the states, we have to 

take recourse to the judicial channels of the respective three High Courts in order 

to settle disputes falling under the administrative control of the other states as well.  

Therefore,  the  present  Bill  has  been  brought  in  order  to  expand  the  scope  and 

jurisdiction of the High Courts and also with a view to correcting the definition of 

admiralty.
