  Indeed education can be the panacea for addressing 

the problems of increasing population and many other problems being faced by us. 

The  setting  up  of  six  new  IITs  during  the  last  only  two  years  as  compared  to 

sixteen  IITs  during  the  last  sixty  years  is  indicative  of  the  resolve  of  this 

Government  and  underlines  the  fact  that  this  Government  has  been  taking  big 

strides  forward  in  this  direction.  There  is  a  need  to  seriously  ponder  over  the 

reasons  of  declining  standards  in  education  during  the  last  few  years.  We  can 

certainly  go  for  quantitative  increase  and  also  the  increase  in  physical 

infrastructure  facilities  but  we  will  certainly  need  to  have  dedicated  teachers  for 

bringing  about  the  qualitative  improvement.  There  is  a  need  to  create  such  an 

environment in which it is easy to understand the requirements of the teachers. It 

will result in the creation of a seminal power.
