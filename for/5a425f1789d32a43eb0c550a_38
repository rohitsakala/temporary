  The  role  of  the  House  in  passing 

Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be certainly remembered by the people of 

the country in future. A need of reform was felt in economy and market of the 

country.  Today,  economy  unity  of  the  country    is  necessary  to  strengthen 

political unity and solidarity of the country. The Government has made efforts 

to  include  a  major  untouched  aspect  of  the  country  in  national  unity  through 

these four bills for GST.
