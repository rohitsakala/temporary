  A  proposal  was  passed  on  7  December, 

2010 by the Union Cabinet announcing 20 IIITs to be started under the public-private 

partnership but only 15 IIITs started functioning out of them.  But these institutes are 

not empowered to grant degrees.  A provision to this effect has been made in this Bill 

for which I congratulate the hon. Minister.  I would request that one IIIT should also 

be set up in Kolhapur.  Kolhapur is also an industrial hub as many big companies like 

the Kirlosker, Raymonds are based there.  If we open such an institute there it would 

create job opportunity for 20-25 thousand people.
