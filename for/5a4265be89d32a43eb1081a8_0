  This  House  has  already  passed the  Goods  and  Services  Tax  and 

the  Government  remains  committed  towards  its  implementation  from  1st  July, 

2017.    Once  GST  comes  into  force  the  provisions  of  Central  Excise  will  remain 

enforceable  only  in  the  context  of  only  very  few  goods.    Therefore,  it  requires 

amendment  in  some  provisions  of  the  Customs  Act,  Customs  Tariff  Act  and 

Central  Excise  Act.    It  is  for  this  purpose  that  we  are  presenting  this  Bill  for  the 

approval of the House.
