  Our Government is functioning properly 

in the leadership of Modi ji.  All the programmes and policies being formulated by 

the Government are focused on farmers and on the poor people.  I am very happy 

to  note  that  an  amendment  in  the  NABARD  has  been  moved.    The  income  of 

farmers has to be doubled.  We have made an effort to make it a reality.  If we are 

planning  to  double  the  income  of  farmers,  first  we  will  have  to  provide  them 

irrigation  facility.    Today  provision  of  fund  has  been  made  for  farmers  under  the 

Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme.  Until and unless we develop rural roads 

the farmers will continue to suffer.  Today the farmers are in need of loans.  The 

Government have specially made a provision of Rs. 10 crores for the Bank's credit.  

Today  capital  for  banks  has  been  increased  from  rupees  five  thousand  crores  to 

rupees thirty thousand crores which will stop the migration of rural youth to cities.  

Therefore, I think the amendment brought in NABARD Act, it has been brought at 

an appropriate time as it will boost our rural economy and will also contribute in 

development  of  the  farmers  of  the  country.    There  are  eleven  hilly  States  in  our 

country  where  there  are  small  ethnic  groups.    In  Himachal  Pradesh,  about  eighty 

five per cent of the farmers do not have more than five Beegha of land.  I want that 

people should get loans from NABARD because of the rate of interest will be low, 

the people and the farmers will be benefitted.
