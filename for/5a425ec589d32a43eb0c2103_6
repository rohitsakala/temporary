  The  Government  has  made 

strict laws for tax evaders and has provided relief to the genuine tax payers.  The 

tax  with  regard  to  long  term  capital  gain  has  been  reduced  from  03  years  to  02 

years.  This will give benefit to a number of people who intend to dispose of their 

old house to purchase a new one.  Tax rates have also been reduced for the small 

and  medium  businessmen  and  companies  having  sale  of  less  than  Rs.50  crore.  

This has been reduced to 25 per cent.  Small traders having business of upto Rs.2 

crore  can  carry  on  their  business  by  depositing  8  per  cent  presumptive  tax.    The 

Government has provided that if a receipt is of upto Rs.2 crore, it would be 6 per 

cent instead of 8 per cent and through this way an effort has been made to provide 

relief.  Mostly, the accessing officers are truthful, however, 10-20 per cent are such 

as deliberately harass the honest tax payers.  Such officers need to be identified.  It 

is  my  request  that  the  hon.  Finance  Minister  may  pay  attention  towards  it  and 

remove such officers from public dealing to assign them office work.
