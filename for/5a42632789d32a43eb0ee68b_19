  There  are  four  objectives  of 

this Bill.  Firstly, to give national importance to the institutes.  Secondly, the sanction 

for setting up the institutes under the PPP mode.  Thirdly, the Bill is geared towards 

opening new streams of knowledge by establishing these institutes.  Fourthly, the Bill 

is also oriented in the direction of preparing manpower as per the global requirements 

of the industry.  The setting up of the institutes of national importance will increase 

employability in the country.  If we talk in terms of the four top IT companies of the 

country  they  spend  about  Rs.  1723  crore  annually  on  training.    If  the  expenditure 

meant  for  training  of  the  candidates  is  done  through  institutes  and  if  the  training  is 

imparted through the same institutes then it is going to save upto six months to one 

year of time of the students which they have to waste after finishing their education.  

By this view point, this Bill is a commendable step.
