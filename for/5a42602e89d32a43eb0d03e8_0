  The  four  Indian  Institutes  of 

Information  Technology  at  Gwalior,  Allahabad,  Jabalpur  and  Kancheepuram  are 

fully funded by the Government.  Now, by this Bill, we are adding Kurnool to the 

list.  Kurnool has been decided as per the AP Reorganization Act.  Therefore, this 

is  a  very  important  development  for  not  only  Andhra  Pradesh  but  for  the  whole 

higher education sector of India.
