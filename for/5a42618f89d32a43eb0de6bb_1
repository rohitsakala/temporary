  Hon.  Minister  has 

categorically clarified two points that it will have public sector undertakings which 

have not less than 51 per cent investment.  A company may have 51 per cent alone 

or jointly.  The Government has also made a rule that it will have the right to give 

or cancel the licence, which is a welcome step.  We all know that when a company 

is  formed,  it  gets  directors  and  they  have  certain  rights.    There  should  be  a 

provision in the rules that if some international agreement is signed then it should 

be immediately brought into the notice of the House or the Government.  We have 

not given permission to any private company.  I had said that atomic energy is not 

meant  for  producing  electricity  alone,  it  has  wider  implications  for  our  security 

institutes, medical system, agriculture and even in the preservation and protection 

of seeds.  I would like to say with all humility that if any company of Tamil Nadu 

which has got 51 per cent shares can become the partner if it wishes so.  However, 

the  circumstances  took  such  a  turn  that  in  the  year  2003  a  good  project  like 

Bhawani states that since they did not have raw material, they incurred losses and 

could not produce power.  Our two plants are lying half constructed at the border 

of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh even today.  Despite that, the Government did 

not  wake  up  from  their  slumber  for  10  to  12  years.    I  had  stated  that  there  is  no 

scarcity  of  raw  material.    I  can  claim  that  India  has  got  so  much  of  quantity  of 

thorium that it can feed half of the world.  Still if it is stated in the report of 2003-

04  that  there  was  a shortage of raw  material  for  production  of power  in  Bhawani 

then  it  could  be  an  outcome  of  wrong  policies.    I  would  like  to  congratulate  the 

Government for keeping the right to accord and cancel the licence.
