  The  Government  is  endeavoring  to 

promote cultivation of the crops that have low yield so that farmers are motivated 

to produce them and get more return. In the demarcation of my Vadora Lok Sabha 

constituency, in  addition to  expansion    of  Vadodra  city  Vadodra  rural  area, Savli 

Taluka, Desar Taluka and Vadodra Taluka are included. I request the Government 

to  help  in  all  round  development  of  my  Vadodra  constituency  and  set  up  new 

Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) and the first ever Industrial University in the country 

there.
