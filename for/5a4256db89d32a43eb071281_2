 The Union Government is exercising the power 

given  to  it  under  Article  262  of  the  Constitution.    Now, the  salient  feature  of  the 

proposed  system  is  that  there  will  be  a  permanent  tribunal  instead  of  different 

tribunals  comprising  a  Chairman,  Deputy  Chairman  and  maximum  six  Members.  

Their  maximum  age  limit  will  be  70  years.    A  committee  would  be  constituted 

before referring any water dispute to the tribunal and the tribunal will dispose such 

disputes within a maximum time span of four to five years. 

The Bill was introduced.
