  The  Banking  system  is 

important for the economy of the country and it is a matter of regret that even after 

65  years  of  the  country's  independence,  more  than  50  per  cent  population  of  the 

country is still not connected with the banking system.  I would like to congratulate 

the hon. Prime Minister who introduced the Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana to 

connect  the  maximum  part  of  the  country  with  the  banking  system  and  that 

augmented their share in our economic development.  The NPA must be classified 

on the basis of their causes.  The deliberate ones must be recovered.  40 per cent 

loans have been provided for the priority sector and 60 per cent for the non-priority 

sector.  70 per cent people depend on the  priority sector.  As such, it needs to be 

improved.  Loans should be provided for the priority sector.  Secondly, it must be 

for  the  agricultural  sector  and  in  villages.      Branches  should  be  there  for  this 

purpose.  Today, the farmers are under the burden of debt.  That also needs to be 

taken seriously.  There is need to improve upon the banking sector.
