 This Act has been in vogue since 1988 but has it 

been able to hook any of the benami transactions?  Income Declaration Scheme has 

been launched this year.  This Bill contradicts that Declaration Scheme. This Bill is 

talking  about  benami  property  which  includes  movable,  immovable,  tangible  and 

intangible.  How will the Income Tax Officers have control over the black money 

which is going out of the country through hawala?  Income Tax Department alone 

cannot deal with this.  There may be so many Acts to deal with such actions, like 

hawala, etc.  Customs and Excise Department should also have been integrated so 

that  the  black  money  menace  is  tackled.    The  people  who  are  embezzling  the 

money  are  actually  traitors of  the  country.   This  Bill is a  well intended Bill but  I 

feel that this should be integrated with the hawala, customs, drugs, etc.
