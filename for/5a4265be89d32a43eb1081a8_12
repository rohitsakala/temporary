  I  would  like  to 

submit that through this historical amendment, this august House has delegated its 

all the powers to the GST Council.  This is a historical step which will be always  

remembered by the people of this country.  In addition to that, we have noted the 

suggestions  given  by  the  hon.  Members  and  we  will  work  towards  providing 

adequate  solutions  for  that.  I  would  also like  to say  that  these  amendments  were 

essential for the implementation of GST.  Our country is marching towards a new 

economic  era  and  I  can  say  that  for  the  first  time  after  70  years  of  independence 

our country is moving towards attaining the economic freedom.   I would also like 

to submit that all the apprehensions made in this regard would be addressed.  After 

the implementation of GST from 1st July, GST Council would provide solutions to 

the problems arising in future. 

 

SHRI  TATHAGATA  SATPATHY  speaking  on  the  motion  to  pass  the 

Bill,  said:  The  GST  Network  is  supposed  to  form  the  backbone  of  the  new  tax 

regime.  The Central Government and the State Governments together have about 

49    per  cent  holding,  and  51  per  cent  holding  is  owned  by  financial  institutions.  

Now more than 60 per cent of financial transactions are being done by government 

banks and 30 odd per cent are being done by HDFC Ltd., HDFC Bank and the so-

called private companies.  You are taking  more than 60 per cent transactions and 

handing over the data to the private companies which are handling 30 per cent of 

the  data  already.      All  that  I  want  to  know  from  the  Minister  is  this.    If  it  is  a 

national security issue, then why are these  people being handed over so much data 

and why is RTI and C&AG  banned from investigating into this thing?
