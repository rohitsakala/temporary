 Our position is that the advances of science 

and technology should be utilized to the common good of our society.  At the same 

time,  we  should  acknowledge  and  recognize  the  global  trends  especially  in  the 

field of nuclear energy.  Nuclear energy cannot be India's major source of energy 

and it should not be.  Share of nuclear power in global electricity is less than 11 per 

cent for a third year in a row.  So, these are clear indications.  Because of growing 

safety  concerns,  the  capital  cost  per  Mega  Watt  of  installed  capacity  has  been 

going up phenomenally.  It is time that the country takes stock of where we stand 

vis-Ã -vis  the  nuclear  power.    What  is  not  understood  is  the  reason  for  not 

encouraging private sector in this field.  India is one of the leaders of the thorium 

revolution.  The first step, however, would be to stop the step-motherly treatment 

of  private  players  in  the  nuclear  sector.    Another  area  where  the  country  has  not 

fully exploited the potential is in nuclear medicine.  We should encourage research 

in this important medical specialty involving application of radioactive substances 

in the, diagnosis and treatment of many diseases like cancer.  I had written a letter 

to  the  hon.  Minister  as  to  why  the  Government  of  India  and  the  Government  of 

Andhra  Pradesh  are  deciding  to  shift  6000  MW  of  nuclear  power  plant  from 

Haripur  in  West  Bengal  to  an  area  in  Prakasam-Nellore  districts  in  Andhra 

Pradesh.  They  are  doing  this  in  view  of  the  West  Bengal  Government's  outright 

rejection  of  the  nuclear  plant  there.    Kindly  look  into  this  and  give  some  further 

information about this project.
