  The  NABARD  Act  was  introduced  in  the 

Parliament in 1981.  The Government's vision of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' comes 

to  the  fore  through  this  Bill.    Rs.10,000  crore  of  the  authorized  capital  of 

NABARD    could  be  spent  for  the  rural  development.    This  amount  has  been 

increased  to  Rs.30,000  crore  which  is  certainly  an  appreciable  move.    This  Bill 

provides for Rs.10 crore to be given for manufacturing if it is taken up in the rural 

areas.  A number of things have been dovetailed with one another in 'Sabka Sath 

Sabka  Vikas'  and  'Make  in  India'.    The  poor  can  bring  about  development  in  the 

rural  areas  with  the  help  of  NABARD.    Thus,  the  NABARD  Bill  is  going  to 

provide an golden opportunity to the unemployed youth of this country.  This will 

usher in not only the rural development but also leave the rural folk to their self-

reliance.    At  the  same  time,  the  rural  development  will  prevent  them  from 

migrating to the cities and everybody will get employment.
