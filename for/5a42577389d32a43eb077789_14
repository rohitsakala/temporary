  It  is  a  fact  that  technical  and  science 

education is the key for success.  The countries that have concentrated on science 

and  technology  are  topping  the  world.    It  is  time  to  concentrate  on  higher 

education  and  provide  opportunities  to  our  youths  to  go  ahead  in  the  field  of 

science  and  technology.    We  have  to  establish  more  institutions  of  higher 

education in the country, especially in rural areas like the North-East of India.  We 

need  to  establish  more  IITs  and  NITs  in  the  country.    Assam  is  one  of  the  most 

backward States as far as education is concerned.  One of the main reasons is lack 

of institutions of higher education and science and technology.  I would request the 

hon.  Minister  to  initiate  action  for  establishment  of  more  NITs  and  IITs  and 

educational  institutions  for  technical  and  higher  education.    Simultaneously  we 

need to provide the required facilities to those NITs that are already available.  An 

NIT  cloud  storage  of  academic  material  should  be  established  at  NIT  Silchar.  

Tele-medicine  project  and  other  projects  should  be  implemented  so  that  the 

faculties get social recognition.  I would like to end my speech with the request for 

establishment of more NITs and IITs in Assam.
