  I come from Mumbai and the real estate has 

been functioning in Mumbai widely and a large population is affected by this trade.  

My  main  suggestion  is  that  real  estate  may  be  considered  as  an  industry  by  the 

Government  and  it  may  be  given  the  status  of  an  industry  as  the  real  estate 

contributes  6.3  per  cent  of  Indian  GDP.    While  RERA  will  only  regulate 

developers,  it  should  also  be  an  authority  which  can  grant  approvals  for  projects 

and monitor compliance.
