 The list of incident of hijacking occurred in the 

history of civil aviation does not mention the hijacking incident of the plane flying 

from  Delhi  to  Lucknow  on  20th  December  1978.    This  was  the  first  incident  of 

hijacking  perpetrated  for  political  benefit.    Hijacking  in  itself  is  a  serious  crime.  

Our  government  has  brought  this  bill  for  checking  such  a  crime.    We  can  make 

several  provisions  so  as  to  prevent  hijacking  of  planes.    We  will  have  to  install 

advanced systems at the airport so as to strengthen the security arrangements at the 

airports.  The ground handling staff are large in numbers and frequently move from 

one  place  to other  at  the  airport.   Therefore, if  a  ground  handling  staff  enters  the 

airport  after  proper  security  check  and  frisking  then,  he  or  she  should  not  be 

allowed  to  go  out  unless  it  is  very  urgent.    I  take  this  opportunity  to  express  my 

gratitude  to  both  the  hon.  Ministers  for  setting  up  an  international  airport  at 

Kushinagar.
