  After  Independence,  Article  341  has  been 

amended  six  time.    But  there  are  still  some  castes,  which  have  been  left  out 

including  Nomadic  Tribes,  Semi  Nomadic  Tribes.    So,  I  would  urge  upon  the 

Government and the hon. Minister that one time system has to be evolved to direct 

the  States  that  after  a  thorough  study,  they  should  send  a  proposal  about  those 

castes, which have been left out.  Then, we may include all those castes in the List.  

I  would  again  urge  upon  the  hon.  Minister  to  immediately  write  to  the  States 

asking  for  the  information  on  whatever  castes  left  out,  who  could  not  get  the 

facilities  under the  Scheduled  Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes category, so that they 

may  also  be  included  in  the  List.    I  urge  upon  the  hon.  Minister  and  also  the 

Government to start Navodaya school in each district of our country.  This is very 

important for the welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  Further, 

Minorities  are  also  being  neglected.   I  urge  upon  the  Government  to take  care  of 

these minorities also.  Another important thing is the amount which is allocated to 

the welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  Government of India 

has to increase the percentage of money which is being allocated to the welfare of 

the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  You take this very seriously.  Finally, 

the  UPA  Government  has  started  so  many  welfare  schemes  for  the  Scheduled 

Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes.    You  continue  them.    Government  should  give 

proper representation to the SCs and STs in the Cabinet.  We are asking you to do 

social justice.
