 I rise to support this Bill.  In my parliamentary 

constituency  Bhadohi  in  Uttar  Pradesh,  people  of  Bind,  Nishad,  Dhimar 

communities have their relatives in Delhi and Madhya Pradesh who are included in 

the scheduled caste list.  Similarly, they also want that they should also be included 

in the scheduled caste list and it is their right also.  At last I would like to say that I 

have  faith in our  Army  and  Rashtrya  Swayam  Sewak  Sangh that  they  are  able  to 

face  any  sort  of  challenge.    Rashtrya  Swayam  Sewak  Sangh  have  been  working 

towards the betterment of every section i.e. farmers, labourers, students, deprived 

classes, women of our society.
