  Ever since the formation of this Government, 

all the laws enacted by this government have been people  centric and poor people 

oriented.    Today,  this  Bill  brought  by  hon.  Minister  is  also  a  people  centric  and 

meant  for  poor  people.    This  Bill  also  aims  to  provide  rehabilitation  to  those 

affected  by  the  HIV  together  with  ensuring  their  welfare.    In  the  year,  1986  Dr. 

Sumit Soloman and his student Dr. Selepan Nirmal first detected the HIV case in 

Chennai  city  of  Tamil  Nadu.    Indian  doctors  are  seen  with  respect  all  over  the 

world.  HIV people are discriminated against, denied admission in schools and are 

also  not  provided  any  facilities  including  free  treatment  in  the  hospitals.    I 

understand  that  many  good  provisions  have  been  made  in  this  Bill  including  the 

penalty  provisions.    Almost  90  per  cent  AIDS  patient  reside  in  China,  India, 

Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.  The Government has accepted 10 out 

of 11 suggestions made by the standing committee.  Our government has provided 

for health for all in the newly declared health policy and this will go a long way in 

benefitting  the  AIDS patient.   Along  with  the  enactment  of  laws, participation  of 

people should also be ensured.   Otherwise we cannot achieve success in this field.  

I would request the government that we should rope in our religious leaders in the 

awareness campaign because a very large number of people follow that.  We can 

do a lot of work in terms of prevention of this disease.
