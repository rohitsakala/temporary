  As  far  as  the  Finance  Ministry  is 

concerned,  our  responsibility  and  our  scope  of  administration  are  restricted  to 

Section  20.    We  have  tried  to  address,  and  we  have,  of  course,  replaced  the 

obsolete Section 20 and brought in a modern day interpretation of how this should 

be  done.    As  far  as  the  broader  question  about  these  multiple  overlapping  Acts, 

particularly  those  that  pertain  to  Public  Trusts  and  the  beneficiaries  in  the 

permanent religious charitable trusts, is concerned, it is under consideration of the 

Law Commission right now.  We have already moved to improve the Indian Trusts 

Act as it is right now.  I am sure that as we work in repealing and amending some 

of these obsolete laws, we will try and bring some sanity to all of these Trusts as 

well. 

 

The Bill was passed.
