 This Amendment Bill concerns 

with our industry and economy.  We have to give opportunity to everyone by linking 

skill  development  to  human  resource.    Skilled  workers  and  labourers  are  the 

backbone of our country and our economy as well.  We have to give more importance 

to skill knowledge instead of degrees.  We have to strengthen our rural economy by 

giving opportunities to the poor and this can be done by the Centre, States and private 

sector together.  Our population has been increasing, therefore, it would be better for 

us to promote IIITs to boost our economy.
