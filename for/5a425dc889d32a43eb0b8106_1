    Upper House recommends that there ought to 

be an opportunity to opt out of the Aadhaar scheme.  Secondly, clause 7 has also 

been  amended  by  the  Upper  House  because  the  original  Clause  7  gave  the 

impression that the  government  can insist  on  Aadhaar as  a  condition  for  availing 

government  subsidies,  benefits  or  services.    This  entire  Bill  is  meant  to  deliver 

benefits  and  services  to  the  poorest  and  the  most  disadvantaged  sections  of  the 

population.  I think national security was not properly defined in the original Bill.  

I would be open to abuse and misinterpretation.  The new language suggested by 

the Upper House would be much better for our country at large.  If this clause 57 

remains in the Bill, then it will always be open to questioning that it is not properly 

a  Money  Bill.  I  think  that  the  Upper  House  has  recommended  that  this  clause 

should be deleted and I agree that has come from the Upper House.  We must not 

only abide by the letter of the Constitution, we should also respect the spirit of the 

Constitution.
