  The acquisition and amalgamation the need 

of the day and what will happen after the merger?  There are four points, which we 

will  achieve,  namely,  rationalization  of  resources;  reduction  in  the  cost;  better 

profitability;  lower  cost  of  funds;  ultimately,  leading  to  better  rate  in  interest  to 

public at large; and improve productivity and consumer services.  The question that 

remains to be asked here is this.  Why were all these subsidiaries established in the 

past? The objective definitely shows that it was done in interest of public at large 

of  this  country.    Further,  the  State  Bank  of  India  is  having  its  own  existence  for 

India as they are having a number of branches in the country. We have seen rise of 

NPAs in the public sector banks but not in SBI.  That is why, the new move of the 

Government,  the  amendment  to  the  State  Banks  (Repeal  and  Amendment)  Bill, 

2017 is very much essential and I extend full support to this Bill.
