    The  Bill  seeks  to  increase  the  capital  of 

NABARD.    It  transfers  RBI's  share  to  the  Central  Government.    Under  the  1981 

Act  experts  in  small-scale  industries  are  included  in  the  Board  of  Directors.    I 

would like to say that normally these experts are not drawn from the North Eastern 

Region,  and  we  would  like  that  from  the  North  Eastern  Region  and  from  the 

mountain  States,  in  particular,  such  experts  may  be  drawn.    The  Ground  Level 

Credit  (GLC)  is  less  than  one  per  cent  for  the  North  East  which  is  one  of  the 

reasons why there is a huge problem in the North East.  NABARD should do the 

work,  it  is  mandated  to  do,  which  is  holistic  development  and  it  becomes  a  very 

important  element  in  the  Government's  policy  of  doubling  the  income  of  farmers 

by 2022.  In the State of Sikkim, we are confident that NABARD can play a very 

important  role.    I  think  that  the  re-financing  route  that  NABARD  is  presently 

following may have to be looked into.
