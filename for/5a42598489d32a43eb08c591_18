  There  is  a  need  to  develop  such  an  education 

system  which  is  based  on  moral  values.    The  number  and  quality  of  teachers  in 

NITs need to be increased.  The moot question is that nothing is going to come out 

unless  we  bring  qualitative  improvement  in  teaching  at  NITs  and  also  make  it 

employment-oriented.      There  is  a  need  for  setting  up  of  NIT  like  institutes  in 

various  states  of  the  country  like  North-Eastern  States  and  Jammu  and  Kashmir 

etc.  I would like to request that the Government should open up at least two NITs 

in Bihar.
