  This  Amendment  will  strengthen  data  collection 

mechanism  in  the  State  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir.    I  would  like  to  suggest  to  the 

Union Government to incorporate a provision into the proposed Bill.  There should 

be a time-frame for furnishing data or statistics and it has to be made binding on all 

because  the  current  status  of  statistics  of  some  departments  with  regard  to 

adequacy, timelines and reliability are far from satisfactory.  Timely availability of 

statistics  is  the  essence  of  the  efficiency  of  national  statistical  system.    The 

statistics and compilation of data on multi-varied subjects are absolutely essential 

for  formulating  policies  and  schemes.  Therefore,  the  appropriate  and  accurate 

collection of data cannot be taken lightly.
