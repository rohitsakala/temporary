 I welcome this legislation which is aimed 

at  repealing  certain  Acts  relating  to  the  State  Bank  of  India  and  its  erstwhile 

associate  banks.    With  the  merger  of  these  banks,  the  Acts  relating  to  erstwhile 

subsidiaries  have  become  redundant  and  the  State  Bank  of  India  Act  requires 

certain  modifications  and  those  are  being  carried  out  through  this  legislation.  

Though it is slightly delayed, this Government has taken the right step in merging 

the  State  Bank  of  India  and  its  associate  banks.    I  request  this  Government  to 

further  identify  and  merge  the  banks  and  bring  down  the  number  to  a  reasonable 

level  and  make  them  competitive  in  the  global  market.    Likewise,  I  request  this 

Government  that  in  the  process  of  merger,  we  must  ensure  that  none  of  the 

stakeholders  like  depositors,  borrowers,  and  employees  of  the  banks  shall  be 

adversely  impacted.    I  would  also  request  the  Government  to  sympathetically 

consider  the  demands  of  banks  pensioners.    Again,  Non-Performing  Assets  of 

commercial banks, especially public sector banks, have reached unacceptably high 

levels.  So, tackling this menace is an urgent need as the integrity of the financial 

system  is  in  jeopardy.  I  appreciate  the  sincerity  and  commitment  of  this 

Government for coming out with various initiatives for strengthening the financial 

systems.
