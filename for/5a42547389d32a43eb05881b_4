 Government of India has brought the proposal 

of  this  amendment  to  this  Bill  by  accepting  the  long  pending  demand  of  lawyers 

and common people.  This Bill will also benefit the poor man because if he hires 

any  lawyer  of  High  Court  then  the  fee  is  20  times  higher  than  the  fee  of  Lower 

Court  lawyer.    I  would  also  like  to  submit  that  pecuniary  jurisdiction  should  be 

increased from 2 crore to 5 crore.  Intellectual people who have been endeavouring 

towards  the  advancement  of  the  country,  have  to  take  initiative  in  this  direction.  

There  are  my  few  suggestions  that  the  revenue  earned  from  the  Lower  Courts 

should be used in making arrangements for chambers therein.  My other suggestion 

is that if circle rates are increased according to the pecuniary jurisdiction then their 

prices should also be increased accordingly.
