  I  thank  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Minister  of 

Urban  Development  for  implementing  two  important  schemes  namely  Smart  City 

Project and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation i.e. AMRUT. 

Urban infrastructural facilities are facing the burden of exodus at large scale. In my 

constituency Jalgaon, at present there are 5828 slum clusters having a population of 

about 30000. These people have no access to any kind of civic amenities like potable 

water or toilets etc. I urge upon the Government to coordinate with the Government 

of Maharashtra and execute housing project under AMRUT Scheme in Jalgaon town 

and take necessary action for relocation of these slum dwellers so that the standard 

to living of these people could be raised.
