  This Act was enacted 

in  1951  and  now  we  are  changing  a  very  small  provision  that  except  industrial 

alcohol, all other alcohol, mostly the ones that are consumed by human beings, will 

be under the control of the States.  If we see this amendment, prima facie there is 

no reason for opposition to this Bill.  But my point is, by perpetuating this process, 

are we not continuing the Licence Raj  that, obviously, everybody wants to get rid 

of?    So,  it  is  time  the  Central  Government  decides  and  takes  positive  action  to 

relinquish the holding powers that it has which mess up the governance system of 

this  country.    Has  the  ban  by  the  States  really  helped  them  in  controlling  the 

consumption of alcohol?  Alcohol is available in plenty in all the States which have 

a ban imposed in those States.  Ban is something that, I do not believe, has actually 

helped society anywhere.  So, per se, I support the Bill.  Today, by imposing ban 

on natural substances, we have actually forced a lot of these people to move on to 

alcohol.  I would suggest that the Central Government in totality should look at all 

the  laws  and  should  try  to  relinquish  too  much  of  reign  holding.    They  should 

allow  states  to  develop  their  own  policies,  abilities  and  strong  points  to  become 

prosperous.  The Central Government should only play the role of a mediator or an 

arbitrator and not play the role of a big brother governing from the top.
