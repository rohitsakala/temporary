 I rise to speak in favour of this Bill.   You are 

all well aware of the pathetic condition of  Kosi, Mahananda, Gamdak, Punpun and 

Son rivers.  Kosi and Mahananda are the largest rivers of our country.  This project 

is about how to improve the condition of Kosi, Mahananda, Gandak, Punun rivers   

alongwith  Manihari  and  Kursela  ports  as  without  constructing  Manihari  port  it 

cannot be in good and proper condition.
