  I support the Institute of Petroleum and 

Energy  Bill,  2017.    If  we  carefully  go  through  the  contents  of  the  Bill,  it  clearly 

mentions that since energy sector is developing with traditional hydrocarbon sector 

and  new  sources  of  energy  like  liquified  natural  gas,  bio-energy  and  renewable 

energy  are  also  coming  in  the  market  with  hydrocarbons,  this  institute  would 

undertake  advance  research  work  in  these  areas  to  secure  and  maintain  leading 

position in this field.  As we are aware that the traditional hydrocarbon sources are 

decreasing and it  is  required for  the  future  of the  coming generations  to  focus on 

non-traditional  sources  and  new  sources  of  energy.    There  is  big  reserves  of  oil 

shales  in  India  which  could  certainly  be  used  for  future  generations.    I  would 

request  the  hon.  Minister  that  western  Uttar  Pradesh,  Haryana  and  Rajasthan  are 

such States where there are sufficient reserves of hydrocarbons and non-traditional 

hydrocarbons, so one such institute should also be set up there.  At last, I want to 

say that our government believes in knowing and then doing the right thing.
