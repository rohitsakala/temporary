  This  is  a  most  welcome 

legislation  which  seeks  to  declare  20  existing  IIMs  as  institutions  of  national 

importance.  I must congratulate the hon. Minister for showing a good model.  The 

Government  is  not  interfering  in  appointing  the  head  of  the  institution.    At  the 

same  time,  have  to  realize  our  weakness  also.    We  have  no  exposure  to  R&D 

institution  and  industries.    The  linkage  and  industries  and  linkage  with  R&D 

institutions  is  the  need  of  the  hour.    I  would  like  to  say  something  regard  to  the 

reservation.    The  Sachar  Committee  which  is  known  as  the  Magna  Carta  of  the 

minorities  in  the  country  has  conserved  that  in  the  higher  education  institutions 

such as IIT, IIM and the Central University, the representation of the minorities is 

negligible.    That  is  to  be  corrected.    When  we  talk  about  inclusive  development, 

these kinds of issues will have to be addressed properly.
