 The footwear and leather marketing sector 

has  gone  through  transformative  change.   Our  country  is  at  the  third  place  in  the 

world  as  far  as  the  market  of  footwear  and  leather  industry  is  concerned.    This 

sector offers huge scope of employment for our youth and there is a huge demand 

of skilled manpower as far as designing and development of the footwear industry 

is  concerned.    FDDI  was  set  up  in  the  country  in  the  year  1986  and  seven  such 

institutes  have  been  functioning  in  the  country  at  present.    Besides,  five  more 

institutes are to be set up.  However, there was no single authority in the country to 

govern these institutes.  Through this Bill an effort is being made to set up national 

level  institute  for  this  sector.   It  will  not  only  brighten  up  the  future  prospects  of 

our youth but also open the door of the world for them.  This will also facilitate the 

exchange of extant global technology with India.  This will also open employment 

opportunities for our youth all across the world.
