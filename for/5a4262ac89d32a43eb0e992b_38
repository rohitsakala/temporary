  The  proposed  route  No.72  having 

length  of  636Km  is  the  longest  route  and  involves  Narmada  river.  It  is  starting 

from  Hoshangabad,  but  it  could  be  started  from  Bhedaghat.  There  is  a  chain  of 

dams  on  this  route.    I  just  have  a  specific  question  that  how  do  you  think  to 

maintain desired water level in a river, which does not originate from glacier and 

also have a chain of dams.
