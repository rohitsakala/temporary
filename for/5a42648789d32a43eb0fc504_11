  Through  this  Bill  India  would  be  able  to  earn  its 

rightful place in the world as far as the field of biotechnology is concern.  It is such 

a field in which we can bring about comprehensive and organized development by 

using  our  knowledge  in  the  field  of  saving  the  lives  and  use  of  food  technology.  

We  can  also  find  a  solution  to  the  health hazard  posed  by  the  negative  effects  of 

scientific progress.  Through this Bill the government has taken a resolve to revive 

all the scientific institutions and knowledge.  This Bill will pave a way for India to 

participate in positive competition in this field.  I would also like to suggest that we 

should  also  put  a  stop  to  the  brain  drain.    Through  this  Bill  we  will  get  an 

opportunity to turn our talent in the field of biotechnology into a viable force.
