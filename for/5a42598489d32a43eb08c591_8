    This  seems  to  be  a  small  bill  but  it  has  far  reaching 

implication  in  our  country.  I  would  also  like  to  know  if  one  institution  from  the 

State  getting  the  benefit  to  that  importance  of  National  institution,  what  is  the 

reservation  policy  of  that  institution.  That  is  not  clear.  Our  neighbouring  country 

China is spending more than us. What is happening in our institutions of national 

importance,  Central  Universities  and  IITs?  The  Ministry  of  Human  Resource 

Development has announced to increase the annual fees of IITs from Rs. 90,000 to 

Rs. 2 lakh. The SC/ST students get only 50 per cent concession. That means, they 

have to pay Rs. 1 lakh. How is it possible? I am myself a victim of this practice. I 

had  got  the  admission  but  I  could  not  pay  the  fees  at  that  time.  The  vacancy  of 

SC/ST  teaching  faculties  is  because  they  are  not  ready  to  fill  up.  Our  higher 

educational  institutions  are  trying  to  create  their  institutions  as  elite  institutions. 

They  are  not  ready  to  implement  the  regulation  of  this  country.  They  are  not 

implementing the reservation norms. I think the present Minister will take care of 

these things because he has a lot of ideas in this regard. Lakhs of engineering seats 

are lying vacant in this country because the students do not have money to pay. A 

huge amount of money is needed for getting admission in the private self-financing 

institutions.
