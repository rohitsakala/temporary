 Goods and Services Tax is a welcome move. It has 

become necessary that taxation method facilitates ease of doing business for local 

as  well  as  international  companies.  Since  GST  is  a  destination  tax  it  will  be 

beneficial  for  many  consumer  States.  There  are  concerns  for  the  manufacturing 

states for fear of losing out on revenue because of the new tax regime. If the GST 

is to be implemented in true spirit, all the additional taxes like Mandi tax and the 

R&D tax which are kept out of the purview of the GST have to be subsumed in the 

GST. Real  estate  has  been  kept  out  of  the  GST.  I  hope  that  the  Government  will 

keep  in  mind  its  agenda  of  Make  In  India  and  the  need  to  boost  exports  before 

deciding the GST rates. The global average of GST or VAT is 16.4 per cent. This 

would  not  be  beneficial  for  Indian  manufacturers  and  exporters  as  they  will  be 

directly  competing  against  the  countries  which  have  lower  tax  rates  compared  to 

India.
