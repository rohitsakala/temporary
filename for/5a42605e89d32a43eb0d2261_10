  I  have  certain  important  suggestions  to  make 

before the Hon. Minister. There is a precondition for the candidates willing to take 

JEE  examination  that  they  should  possess  minimum  of  75  per  cent  marks  in  12th 

class.  The  condition  of  scoring  75  per  cent  marks  should  go.  There  should  be 

simple  condition  for  the  entrance  examination  that  whosoever  qualifies  the  exam 

should get admission. New IITs are coming up. There is an increasing demand for 

faculty  in  them.  However,  there  is  a  condition  attached  to  recruiting  the  teachers 

that  they  should  be  having  PhD  degree.  This  precondition  of  PhD  should  not  be 

there. Our syllabus have become outdated and obsolete. Therefore, there is a need 

to  develop  interdisciplinary  and  multidisciplinary  approach  in  formulating  the 

syllabus. IIT should be provided best research facilities. Efforts should be made to 

enhance  the  core  competence  of  the  IITs.  Efforts  should  be  made  to  identify  the 

talent  in  the  country  and  due  promotion  should  be  given  to  nurture  them.  A 

Kendriya Vidyalaya should be opened in Baghpat.
