   I am saying this because earlier the grant of 

mining  lease  was  based  completely  on  discretion.  After  the  decision  of  the 

Supreme Court, necessary amendments were carried out in the Mines and Mineral 

(Development  and  Regulation)  Act  and  the  Bill  was  introduced  in  2015.  The 

necessary  provisions  were  made  by  replacing  Section  11  with  a  new  Section  11, 

which was introduced, whereby the mineral concession was required to be granted 

only  through  auction.  In  the  present  Bill,  Section  12A  is  regarding  transfer  of 

mineral concession. Earlier, the transfer of mineral concession was available only 

through  auction,  but  the  captive  mining  leases  were  not  taken  into  consideration, 

which  was  in  the  interest  of  development  of  the  mining  sector.  Therefore,  the 

present Bill is only with respect to including those mining leases where the captive 

mining  are  used  for  captive  purposes.  But  the  proposed  licensing-cum-mining 

leases are not made part of this Bill. It may  also be clarified whether this issue is 

also required to be taken into consideration or not.
