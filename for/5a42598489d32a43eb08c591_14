    Brilliant  poor  students  in  villages    whose 

parents cannot afford their fees leave their studies midway.  The Government has 

to find ways so that such brilliant students are able to continue their studies. If we 

spend  more  on  the  education  of  the  children  than  the  Defence  Budget,  then  such 

children  would  perhaps  be  able  to  defend  the  country.  We  should  develop  our 

manpower as it is our main requirement. I thank the previous Government as well 

as  the  present  Government  for  providing  to  an  IITs  in  North-East.  My  request  is 

that the Minister should himself visit both these NIITs in Guwahati and Silcher to 

see the problems being faced by them. It is my request that the Minister should pay 

special attention.
