  The  basic  income  tax  exemption has not been  reduced 

for  the  general  people  and  so  I  request  the  Government  to  raise  the  limit  of  total 

income per person per annum from Rs. 2.50 lakh to Rs. 3.50 lakh for the age group 

up  to  60  years,  and  Rs.  4  lakh  for  senior  citizens  up  to  the  age  of  80  years.  

Secondly,  the  maximum  ceiling  for  monthly  income  scheme  deposit  in  the  post 

office for individual may also be raised from Rs. 4.50 lakh to Rs. 15 lakh and Rs. 9 

lakh  to  Rs.  35  lakh  for  joint  account.    Thirdly,  the  Press  people  during  their  PIB 

accreditation, are entitled to get CGHS medical facilities, but while on retirement 

they and their family members are not getting any medical facilities from CGHS as 

per  the  pensioners.    All  the  CGHS  beneficiaries  during  their  co-terminus  tenure 

may  kindly  be  included  in  the  CGHS  pensioner  scheme  after  their  retirement. 

Under  the  present  employment  and  slowdown  economic  scenario,  we  request  the 

Government to stop disinvesting, closure and sale of CPSEs.
