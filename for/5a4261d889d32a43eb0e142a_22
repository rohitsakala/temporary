 I would request to consider check up by 

psychiatrist  for  each  and  every  child  in  our  country  at  the  school  level  starting 

from first standard.  I will also emphasize that dementia must be included in this 

Bill  as  most  of  the  elderly  people  suffer  from  it.    They  should  be  given  proper 

required  treatment.    There  must  be  some  authority  of  mental  health  which  will 

oversee  all  the  relevant  issues  with  respect  to  mental  health  problems  and 

accountable  to  the  Ministry.    One  mental  hospital  in  each  State  should  be 

identified  by  the  Central  Government  or  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family 

Welfare  and  it  should  be  attached  with  an  AIIMS  or  with  the  Delhi  AIIMS  for 

better treatment.
