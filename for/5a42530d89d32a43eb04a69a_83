 Agriculture Department in Assam had 

been indulging in corruption for the past 15 years. The state does not have proper 

irrigation facilities.  W have so much of agricultural potential that we can employ 

at least 50  lakhs unemployed  youths in  agricultural  activities.   But due to lack of 

irrigation  facilities,  problems  of  floods  and  erosion  and  the  non-availability  of 

seeds on time and tractors to till the land, our farmers are facing a lot of hardships.  

But now, the schemes initiated by the new Government will tremendously benefit 

the farmers.  The schemes like Fasal Bima Yojana, issuance of Soil Health Cards 

etc.  are  greatly  benefiting  the  farmers.    Our  state  produces  lot  of  jutes  but  we  do 

not have jute factories. We had sugar mills which have been shut down.  Even the 

spinning  mills  have  been  closed.    Now  under  the  leadership  of  Shri  Sarbananda 

                                                           
* Original in Assamese 

Sonowalji  a  lot  of  work  for  the  betterment  of  farmers  under  Swarna  Gramin 

Yojana are being taken up.  There is a need to protect the state from the floods in 

rivers like Brahmaputra, Barak etc.
