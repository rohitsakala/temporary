 This is a very sensitive subject.  There 

are about 1-2 crore chronic patients with mental disorder.  As per the latest data of 

National Crime Research Institute, as many as 8,409 people committed suicide in 

the  country.    People  from  Maharashtra,  West  Bengal,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Uttar 

Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are included in it.  We need to think seriously 

about  such  mental  patients.    The  expensive  treatment  of  such  patients  adversely 

impact the economy of the family.  I would therefore, urge upon the hon. Minister 

that such patients after being discharged from the hospitals should be trained under 

the skill development schemes. The hon. Minister has taken a very commendable 

step by modernization of the equipment in hospitals.
