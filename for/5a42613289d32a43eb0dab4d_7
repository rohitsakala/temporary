 My first demand is to increase the percentage of 

reservation for the people belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes 

in proportion to their  population.   It should  be  increased  from  15 to 20 or 22 per 

cent in proportion to their population through a Constitution amendment.  Of late, 

there is a tendency on the part of everyone to sub-classify them and sub-categorise 

them.  It is being done, maybe, for reasons of political benefit or maybe for some 

other benefit.  There are a lot of hostility  towards people belonging to Scheduled 

Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  There are no Secretaries and Joint Secretaries in the 

Government of India from the people belonging to Scheduled Castes community.  

There are no judges in the Judiciary from the Scheduled Castes community.  There 

are so many judgments coming from the Supreme Court against reservation.  There 

is  an  urgent  need  to  revisit  and  relook  at  the  entire  reservation  policy  in  the 

country.  We have to seek justice for the people belonging to the Scheduled Castes 

and  Scheduled  Tribes  once  for  all.    It  is  because  we  are  striving  for  national 

integration.
