  I  rise  to  support  this  Bill.    Right  to 

Free  and  Compulsory  Education  to  all  children  below  the  age  of  14  years  is  a 

constitutional obligation.  It was a revolutionary change which took place in 2002.  

Article 21 is amended in order to incorporate 21 (a) in the Constitution to provide 

right to free and compulsory education to all children between the ages of six and 

fourteen.   But  unfortunately  that  Act  came  into  force  only  in  the  year  2009.   My 

first suggestion to the hon. Minister is to have a discussion on the implementation 

of the RTE Act.  That is the need of the hour.  By 31st March, 2015 every teacher 

in the primary school should possess the minimum and basic qualification.  Now, 

the Government is extending the date of 31st March, 2019.  Article 21 is violated 

by the respective state governments.  The respective state governments are not able 

to train the trainers within the stipulated time of 31st December 2015 means they 

have violated the fundamental right of the citizens of those States.  I would like to 

know  from  the  hon.  Minister  as  to  which  are  the  States  that  have  compiled  with 

article  21(a)  and  which  are  the  States  that  have  demanded  or  sought  exemption 

from this provision?  There are totally 66 lakh primary teachers.  Out of which, 11 

lakh teachers are still untrained.  That means the Right to Education Act is only on 

paper  and  not  in  practice.    Quantity,  quality  and  equality  have  to  be  improved  in 

education.  The point is the GDP contribution to education has to be increased to 

six per cent.
