 I have risen to give my support to the land deal 

regarding which discussion is taking place today. But we also have to see that on 

the one hand we are showing goodwill and sympathy towards Bangladeshis, but on 

the  other  the  Assamese  people  are  in  such  a  difficult  situation  because  of  them. 

Therefore, I would only request the House that under the land deal there should be 

boundary  settlement  and  permanent  demarcation  of  boundary  should  take  place. 

Simultaneously, our country should also get permanent security. There should not 

be any compromise on the question of expatriating the Bangladeshi infiltrators. An 

enclave  of  Bangladeshi  people  has  emerged  in  Assam,  but  we  have  to  see  that 

another enclave does not come up in some other part. Thus, we have to be careful 

in this regard also. We want to have good relations with Bangladesh but we have to 

protect ourselves also because we have to protect Assam.
