  Firstly,  at  the  stage  of  the  introduction  of  the 

Bill, I opposed the raising of fees of IIT to Rs. 2 lakhs per year. I think it is totally 

anti-people. Please ask the IITs to reduce the fees immediately. Secondly, I support 

the  Bill  otherwise,  for  setting  up  IITs  at  Tirupati,  Jammu,  Bhilai,  Palakkad,  Goa 

and Dharwad and converting Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad into an IIT. But I 

ask the hon. Minister that he has given only Rs. 230 crore for six IITs and Rs. 100 

crore for Indian School of Mines. Why has the Government given so little money? 

In  reply  to  a  Question,  the  Minister  had  correctly  said  that  in  spite  of  very  good 

work done by IITs in the past, our IITs are nowhere in the first 250 ranks of global 

education. Therefore, we have to do something to really improve IITs further. My 

suggestion  is  the  IITs  should  go  for  fresh  collaboration  with  top  American  and 

British universities. I would like to ask hon. Minister as to why to our best nuclear 

scientists  resigned  from  the  Board  of  Governors  of  IIT,  Bombay.  We  should 

persuade such people to come back into this.  IIT alumni, especially those who are 

established  abroad,  to  come  forward  and  give  money.    Please  approach  them  for 

getting both money and cutting edge technology.  I am told that 80 per cent of the 

students  of  IIT  Bombay  go  to  America  and  most  of  them  do  not  return.    Let  us 

inculcate  values  in  them  so  that they  love  the  country  and  stay  back.     You  must 

bring up IIT, Tirupati or IIT Palakkad to the level of IIT Bombay.
