 I rise to speak in support of 

this  Bill  which  has  been  brought  in  the  interest  of  the  common  men.    It  is  well 

known  that  the  consumer  was  exploited  in  the  real  estate  sector.    Builders  take 

advance  on  the  promise  of  constructing  flats.    Earlier,  lands  were  bought  from 

farmers at a pittance.  The project for which lands were acquired were not started 

and there were talks of starting other projects.  The farmers were not paid in full.  

Registrations  were  fake,  there  were  no  documents  and  such  types  of  frauds  were 

committed.    This  Bill  has  good  provisions  to  put  a  stop  to  such  frauds.    It  is  my 

belief that this Bill will strengthen the monitoring system.
