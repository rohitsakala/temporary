 

  When  the  Andhra  Pradesh 

Reorganization  Bill  was  enacted,  two  separate  administrative  units  were  carved 

out.  The development of both the states was talked about and it was mulled over 

as  to  how  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Telangana  will  make  progress.    One  of  the  better 

offshoots and well thought out decisions from the discussion was the establishment 

of  a  world  class  Petroleum  and  Energy  Institute  in  Andhra  Pradesh.    In  the 

Schedule 13 of the said Act, it was decided that Indian Institute of Petroleum and 

Energy  would  be  opened  in  Visakhapatnam  for  the  purpose  of  increasing  the 

skilled  manpower.    It  has  been  given  the  shape  of  an  institute  by  setting  up  a 

society.  The initial financial arrangement has also been made and it is already into 

the  completion  of  first  year  of  its  academic  session.    So  far  admission  of  50 

students  each  in two separate  courses of  petroleum  and  chemical  engineering has 

been  given    for  the  academic  session  2016-17.    IIT  Khadagpur  will  work  as  the 

mentor  institute  of  this  proposed  institute.    I  have  brought  this  Bill  before  the 

House to give the status of institution of national importance to the said institute.  

The  Government  has  also  made  an  expenditure  outlay  of  approximately  Rs.650 

crore for this purpose.
