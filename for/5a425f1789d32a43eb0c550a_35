  TDP party is extending fullest support to 

the Union Government in passing of the Central Goods and Services Tax Bill, 

2017; the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Bill, 2017; the Goods and Services 

Tax  (Compensation  of  States)  Bill,  2017  etc.  in  the  larger  interest  of  the 

country.    Andhra  Pradesh  stands  to  lose  Rs.  4,700  crore  revenue  per  annum, 

once the GST comes into force and it would stand to lose Rs. 23,500 crore over 

five  years  as  after  bifurcation,  Andhra  Pradesh  has  become  a  revenue  deficit 

State.  In view of this, I want an assurance from the Government as to how it is 

going to compensate the revenue deficit, given the fact that it is ultimately the 

Centre's responsibility to bridge the gap. I want a clarification on this issue.
