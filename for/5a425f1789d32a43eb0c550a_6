 Our Parliament is the symbol of unity in 

diversity.    The  new  law,  GST  is  also  the  symbol  of  unity  in  diversity.    The 

historic, Goods and Services Tax Bill, 2017 has been introduced.  We welcome 

and  support  this  Bill.    Under  the  Central  GST,  we  have  made  slabs  for  each 

commodity with varying rates but the Central GST would still levy one per cent 

more tax and the burden will be automatically transferred to the consumer.  The 

Government  should  explore  some  alternative  and  amend  this  in  this  regard.  

What are the reasons for not bringing the consumable alcohol under the GST? 

Petroleum products have also not been covered under the GST.  But this is good 

a proposal.
