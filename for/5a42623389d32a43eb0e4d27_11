  I  would  like  to  say  that  the  Child  Labour 

Amendment  Bill,  2016  is  very  important.    I  think  India  is  probably  one  of  the 

fastest growing economies in the world, a powerful nation but at the other side of 

the pendulum we are still struggling with child labour.  The Government needs to 

bring  convergence  to  the  definition  of  adolescence  because  different  Acts  have 

different definition for it.   There is a need to take stringent measures to check child 

trafficking.    I  think  it  is  a very  complex  issue  so  we  should  not  rush  into  pass  it.  

Let there be no attempt at diluting the definitions of 'family' and 'hazardous'.  There 

should be one age block for RTE Act, Juvenile Justice Act and Child Labour Act.  

Every child deserves a good quality education and right of dignity in labour.
