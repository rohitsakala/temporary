 A Bill at the stage of introduction can be opposed 

only  on  two  grounds  -  one  is  the  legislative  competency  of  Parliament,  and  the 

other  is  whether  a  Bill  is  violative  of  fundamental  rights.    Now,  both  those 

objections have not been raised and, therefore, the limited jurisdiction at the stage 

of introduction of Bill that it can be opposed on two considerations does not arise 

at  this  stage.    The  detailed  Finance  Memorandum  clearly  mentions  that  there  are 

certain  categories  of  expenditure  which  cannot  be  estimated  at  this  stage.  

Secondly, the Bill has already been circulated two days in advance and, therefore, 

adequate time has been given.  Again, it is an essential part of legislative drafting 

that some provisions can be amended by  the Schedules.  The Schedules will also 

be considered by this Parliament and, therefore, the rights of Parliament are not in 

any way being taken away by this Bill at all.   

The Bill was introduced.
