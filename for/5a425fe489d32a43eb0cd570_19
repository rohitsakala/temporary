  The  Chhattisgarh  state  government 

decreased  the  reservation  for  scheduled  caste  from  16  to  12  per  cent  on  7th 

December  2011  and  they  have  attributed  two  reasons  for  the  same.    The  first 

reason is that Chhattisgarh state came into existence after the State Reorganisation 

Act, 2000.  The population of scheduled caste came down to 11.6 per cent as per 

the 2001 census as compared to 15.17 per cent as per the 1991 census.  There is a 

provision of 12 per cent reservation for scheduled caste in direct recruitment to the 

Chhattisgarh  state  services  at  present.    The  new  revised  reservation  came  into 

existence in 2011 which also happens to be census year.  As per the 2011 census 

the population of scheduled caste has gone up to 8,55,587 in the state.  Similarly, 

their population which constituted 11.6 per cent in 2001 has now gone up to 12.82 

per  cent.    Therefore,  there  is  a  need  for  corresponding  increase  in  reservation.  

Most of the people belonging to scheduled caste migrate elsewhere due to their bad 

economic condition.  As such these people do not get counted in the census of the 

state.  Moreover, most of the people belonging to this community get their religion 

recorded  as  Christian  or  Satnam.    A  reduction  of  4  per  cent  in  reservation  has 

adversely affected their welfare measures as also constitutional rights.  I, therefore, 

request  the  Chhattisgarh  government  to  restore  the  earlier  reservation  of  16  per 

cent for them by withdrawing the reduction of 4 per cent.
