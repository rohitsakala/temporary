  It  was  long  awaited  that  this  socially  and 

educationally  backward  section  of  the  society  will  get  justice  after  this 

constitutional  amendment.  The  National  Commission  for  Backward  Classes  was 

constituted on 14th August, 1993 but it did not enjoy constitutional status whereas 

other  Commissions  enjoyed.    Now  this  Commission  will  enjoy  constitutional 

status.  It is being alleged that rights of the states are being taken away.  This is not 

correct.    The  states  will  continue  enjoying  their  rights  as  earlier.  OBCs  have  not 

got social justice till now.  They constitute 52 per cent of the population.  A socio-

economic  survey  was  conducted  in  the  year  2011  in  which  details  of  all  castes 

were reflected except OBCs.  OBC constitutes of the artisans doing petty jobs.  I 

thank the Government and welcome this historical Bill.
