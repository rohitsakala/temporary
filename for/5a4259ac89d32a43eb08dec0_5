  After 

this  Amendment, 

the 

Government  will  be  empowered  to  collect  data/statistics  with  regard  to  social, 

economic, geographic, demographic, scientific and environment related aspects of 

Jammu and Kashmir.  Under the Act of 2008, the statistics collected can be used 

only for statistical projects, however, through this Bill the Government is removing 

that  provision  which  could  prove  harmful.    The  Government  should  enact  such  a 

legislation to ensure that the data collected by the Government is not misused and 

the privacy of an individual is not violated.   

 

SHRIMATI  ANJU  BALA:   This Statistics (Amendment) Bill will also be 

applicable to the Government of Jammu and Kashmir in respect of the collection of 

statistics.    In  fact,  this  provision  should  have  been  incorporated  in  the  legislation 

enacted in the year 2008.  Now, the benefit of the schemes of the Government will 

reach  to  all  the  people  of  this  state  whether  they  belong  to  backward  classes  or 

scheduled castes or they are refugees once this Bill is passed as the real time  data 

will be available.  And, at the end, I wholeheartedly support this Bill.
