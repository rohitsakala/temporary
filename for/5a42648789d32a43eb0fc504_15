   I compliment the hon. Minister of Science and 

Technology  for  taking  bold  steps  to  empower  the  field  of  biotechnology  in  our 

country.   This  Centre, I  believe, would  not only  facilitate  more  practical-oriented 

research,  but  would also produce  more  monumental  patents  that  would  gauge the 

success of this Centre in the long run.  This Centre, would give a big boost to the 

biotechnology industry in India, which is presently growing at a rate of 20 per cent 

and is expected to grow at a rate of 30 per cent in the coming years.  It is going to 

provide  immense  potential  to  our  scientists  who  are  forced  to  go  to  the  West  to 

undertake  research  in  this  field.   India  will  emerge  as  a  big  player  in  the  field  of 

pharmaceutical  industry  in  the  world.    We  can  discover  new  vaccines  and  find 

everlasting solutions to communicable diseases too.  I wholeheartedly support the 

Bill.
