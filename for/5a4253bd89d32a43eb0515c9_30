  Shri  Arun  Jaitleyji  is  right  that  as  Finance 

Minister of the country, it is incumbent upon him to avoid any constitutional crisis 

that may emerge if the Uttarakhand State Government is unable to spend after the 

1st  of  April.  But,  the  constitutional  crisis  that  may  happen  on  the  1st  of  April  is 

actually  precipitated  by  the  decision  of  the  Cabinet  on  26th  of  March.  What  was 

there  in  front  of  the  hon.  President  of  India,  and  in  front  of  the  Cabinet,  which 

showed and was evidence of the fact that the elected Government of Uttarakhand 

was not going to be able to function as per the provisions of the Constitution? The 

Governor on 18th evening knew that the entire battle was about the Appropriation 

Bill  and  only  27  MLAs  wrote  to  the  Speaker  of  the  House  to  ask  for  a  vote  by 

division, it  was  not  the  majority.  On  27th,  if  the  minority  asked  for  a  division  of 

vote, Madam, you are not bound to do it. They only signed the memorandum much 

later. This is an absolute travesty of justice and every attempt of this government to 

scuttle a Floor Test has ultimately been set aside by the hon. courts.
