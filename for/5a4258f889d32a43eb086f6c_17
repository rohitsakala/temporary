 The Indian Institute of Petroleum being set 

up  in  Vishakhapatanam  through  this  Bill,  is  a  very  good  initiative.    Besides 

petroleum, alternative energy sources are being explored across the world.  I want 

that  such  an  institute  be  set  up  in  Bhatinda  as  well.    If  an  Indian  Institute  of 

Petroleum  and  Energy  is  setup  in  North-India  also,  the  talented  engineers  of  our 

country would be able to serve in the country itself.
