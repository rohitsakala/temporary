  The  need  for  the  enactment  of 

the High Court and the Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) 

Amendment Bill, 2015 arose because of a judgment delivered by the hon. Supreme 

Court  in  a  writ  petition.    We  have  been  seeing  that  an  advocate  who  has  put  in 

more than 20 years of service is appointed as a High Court judge directly at the age 

of 55 or 56 years.  I know some cases where the High Court judge was appointed 

at the age of 59 or 60 years.  They put in only two or three years of service.  So, 

absolutely the Supreme Court is justified in saying that there is some anomaly, and 

it is the duty of the Parliament to rectify that anomaly.   As far as judge's salary is 

concerned, in the last 65 years, only thrice the salaries of High Court and Supreme 

Court  Judges  have  been  increased.    That  is  why  this  is  the  right  time  the 

Government  should  think  of  increasing  the  salary  of  both  High  Court  Judges  as 

well as Supreme Court Judges.  It has got a direct impact on the pension that they 

are going to get.  Again, there are about 371 vacancies in the various High Courts 

as against sanctioned posts of 1,071.  Secondly, we are not getting efficient, honest 

and dedicated advocates who have got lucrative work in the High Courts to come 

forward to accept judgeship with this meager salary.  Unless you attract them with 

some good salary or some benefits you cannot expect efficient advocates who are 

also  honest  and  who  maintain  integrity  to  become  High  Court  or  Supreme  Court 

Judges.  I would also request the hon. Minister of Law  to think of bringing in the 

Judicial Accountability Bill.  I would also request to the Union Government that a 

circuit bench of the Supreme Court should be established at Bengaluru.  Our Party 

wholeheartedly support this Bill.
