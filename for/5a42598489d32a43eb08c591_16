  Through  this  Bill  the  Government  seeks  to 

provide legal backing to NIT Andhra Pradesh.  I hail from Bihar which  is among 

the most backward state in the country.  The Government should set up at least five 

additional  NITs in  Bihar  keeping  in view  the population  of  the  state  and  also the 

number  of  NITs  that  have  been  opened  in  other  states  of  the  country  so  that  the 

students in Bihar could be benefited.
