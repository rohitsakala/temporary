 The Footwear design and development 

industry is a very large scale industry.  Our country has been witnessing the value 

growth as well as volume growth in respect of this industry.  If we have a look at 

the  global  market  of  the  industry  its  value  comes  around  Rs.8  lakh  crore  out  of 

which  the  contribution  of  Indian  export  is  only  2-3  per  cent.    Hon.  Minister  has 

tried to give national importance to this sector.  Government should  strive to take 

maximum  possible  initiatives  for  providing  employment  opportunities  to  the 

unemployed youth and women.  There is a need to give impetus to the research and 

development  work  in  the  leather  industry.    Kolhapur  is  my  constituency  and 

Kolhapuri  slippers  are  world  renowned  item.    They  are  in  huge  demand  and 

majority  of  work  is  accomplished  by  artisans.    Leather  and  footwear  industry  is 

among the ten industries in the world which have been identified in the world for 

their growth potential.  Whenever we receive any big order in Kolhapur we are not 

in  a  position  to  comply  with  that  for  want  of  resources.    Therefore,  there  is  an 

urgent need for opening an institute in Kolhapur for expanding the market share of 

Kolhapuri  products.    I  especially  demand  for  patenting  the  Kolhapuri  slippers.  

There  is  also  a  need  to  pay  attention  towards  maintaining  the  lightweight  and 

comfort  factor  in  the  leather  industry  products.    There  is  a  need    for  trained  and 

skilled workforce to give impetus to this industry.  There is also a need to work on 

the areas like marketing and design making.
