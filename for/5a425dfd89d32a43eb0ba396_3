    The  Mines  and  Minerals  Act  of  1957 

has vested with Centre to bring in measures for developing the mines.  The present 

amendments  seek  to  give  more  say  to  the  State  Governments  both  in  granting 

approvals  and  in  carrying  out  mining  operations.    This  had  become  necessary 

because of innumerable litigations that had come in the way of using the potential 

of our minerals' wealth at an optimum level.  We support this Bill.
