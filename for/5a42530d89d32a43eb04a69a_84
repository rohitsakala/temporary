    If  irrigation  facilities  are 

provided  in  Bihar,  it  will  bring  about  prosperity  among  the  farmers.    Dozens  of 

perennial rivers flow from Nepal.  If sluice gates are constructed on all these rivers, 

it  will  provide  for  irrigation  of  lakhs  of  acres  of  land.    A  Krishi  Vigyan  Kendra 

should be established at village Sukhait in Jhanjharpur block in my Parliamentary 

Constituency.    Fasal  Bima  Yojana  and  Krishi  Sinchai  Yojana  are  very  good 

schemes in the interest of farmers in the country.
