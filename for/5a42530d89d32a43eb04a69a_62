 I would urge the government to waive the loan 

of farmers of Maharashtra to the tune of Rs. 700 crore.  Tamil Nadu has suffered 

the worst ever drought in the last 140 years.  The Government says that income of 

farmers will be doubled by the year 2022.  Presently, the income of farmers is only 

Rs. 3000.  Does the government want the farmers to live on Rs. 6000 only?  The 

farmers get only Rs. 55 for the pulses whereas the traders sell the same pulses at 

Rs. 200 per kg.  There is a need to increase the production of pulses.  More than 

23500 farmers have committed suicide since year 2001 to 2015.  Rural areas lack 

seed  storage  and  other  infrastructure  facilities.    There  is  a  need  to  promote  cash 

crops  like  horticulture  and  spices.    There  are  lacunae  in  implementation  of  crop 

insurance  scheme.    Micro-credit  to  farmers  is  not  available  on  time.  Special 

attention  should  be  given  to  modern  technical  knowhow  and  training  of  the 

farmers.  These works should be allowed to be undertaken with MNREGS funds.  

Half of the Bihar faces drought whereas the other half faces floods.  A  number of 

sugar mills are closed.  The government should pay attention towards these issues.  

In my constituency, jute and maize crops are also under threat.
