 Today knowledge is power.  I am very proud 

that I am coming from Karnataka where the famous engineer, Shri M. Visvesvaraya 

has contributed much for the country's development since before Independence in the 

field  of  technology.    I  am  proud  to  say  that  the  Visvesvaraya  Technological 

University is there which caters to the needs of the entire Karnataka.  Today it is one 

of the famous institutes.  It was a self-financing institute under the State Government.  

Now we are going in for public-private partnership.  I request the hon. Minister for 

HRD  and  the  hon.  Finance  Minister  to  look  into  the  grievances  of  the  University.  

Engineering  students  should  not  become  job  seekers;  they  should  become  job 

creators.  Under the hon. Prime Minister's dream initiative of 'Make in India' plenty 

of  opportunities  are  available  for  engineers  today.    So,  they  should  go  for 

manufacturing  sector.    There  are  other  areas  like  naval  base,  agriculture  and  food 

processing  which  offer  plenty  of  opportunities  for  the  engineers.    I  once  again 

congratulate  the  hon.  Prime  Minister  and  the  HRD  Minister  for  introducing  a  Bill 

relating to IIITs. These 15 Institutes should be recognized at the world level for their 

excellence.  They should give better service to India and to the world.
