    The  Bill  seeks  to  protect  the 

interest of the home buyers.  An important problem is regarding providing timely 

justice to the consumers.  At present it takes years for the consumers to get justice.  

Tired,  the  consumers  had  to  compromise  with  the  builders.    There  should  be 

transparency  in  the  manner  in  which  speedy  justice  should  be  provided.    All 

categories  of  builders  should  be  covered  in  the  Bill  because  at  present  builders 

construct and sell multi-storied buildings on a small plots in metros.  If they are not 

covered  in  this  Bill  then  large  number  of  small  consumers  would  be  deprived  of 

their right.  The suggestion of the Committee was that in case of any change in the 

project it would be essential to seek the consent of the consumers.  However, now 

it has been provided that only an information needs to be given.  This is not in the 

interest of the consumer.
