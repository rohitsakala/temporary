  There  is  a  need  of  charitable  trust  or 

other similar trusts in our country so that social work should be continued through 

these  trusts.    This  is  a  good  initiative  of  the  Government  in  my  opinion.    The 

people of our society should get free medical treatment as such trusts do not spent 

for the purpose.  Moreover, such trusts do not spent even on education and for the 

development  of  our  society.    Amendment  in  Article  20  and  20A  alongwith  this 

Amendment  is  a  commendable  effort  of the  Government.   Besides, Indian  Trusts 

Act  also  needs  to  be  amended.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  corporate  sector  to 

discharge their CSR.  But they do not do it.  Instead they provide their money to 

the  trusts  and  utilize  the  same  in  other  related  activities.    So,  the  Ministry  of 

Finance  should  fulfill  its  responsibility  by  conducting  regular  monitoring  of  such 

trusts.  I welcome this Amendment.
