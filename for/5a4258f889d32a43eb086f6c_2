  When the State of Andhra Pradesh 

was  divided  into  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Telangana,  there  was  not  even  a  single 

institution  of  national  importance  in  the  divided  Andhra  Pradesh  because  all  the 

institution  were  left  in  Telangana.    As  far  as  the  Andhra  Pradesh  Reorganization 

Act is concerned, it assures the establishment of Petroleum University in the State 

of Andhra Pradesh and this assurance is being fulfilled by our young and dynamic 

Minister of Petroleum and Nature Gas.  This Bill is being introduced to declare it 

as  an  Institution  of  national  importance.  I  hope  the  hon.  Minister  will  give 

autonomy to this Institute to design its own curriculum.  I would request the hon. 

Minister  to  allocate  the  funds  that  are  required  as  per  the  construction  of  the 

buildings  of  the  Institute  so  that  the  Institute  comes  up  with  necessary 

infrastructure  at  the  earliest.    This  institute  is  being  established  to  create  skilled 

manpower  in  the  field  of  petrochemical  engineering  and  also  to  provide  research 

activities  for  this  sector.  I  thank  the  Government  of  Andhra  Pradesh  for  coming 

forward to allot around 200 acres of land free of cost to set up this institute there.  

This  institute  being  established  in  Andhra  Pradesh  because  Andhra  Pradesh  is 

having about 974 kms. Long sea coast and KG Basin promises a huge potential for 

exploitation  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas.    I  mentioned  about  the  presence  of 

hydrate  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal.  The  hon.  Minister  is  aware  about  the  discovery  of 

hydrates  in  the  KG  Basin  area.    I  wish  that  this  institute  will  undertake  research 

activity  in  the  exploration  of  these  hydrates.    When  these  hydrates  are  exploited, 

India will become self-sufficient in energy field.
