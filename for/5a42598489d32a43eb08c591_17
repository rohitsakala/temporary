  There  is  a  need  to  open  institutes  like 

NITs,  IITs  and  IIMs  in  every  state  of  the  country  so  that  our  future  generations 

could be equipped with better education and technology.  Today, a large number of 

students trained at NITs and IITs have been migrating to foreign countries which is 

a great brain drain.  I would like to request the Government that it should integrate 

various  schemes  like  Skill  India,  Mudra  etc.  so  that  the  children  educated  at  the 

institutes  like  IITs  and  NITs  could  get  loan  at  the  minimum  rate  of  interest  to 

motivate them for engaging in self employment in the country.  The Government 

will  have  to  keep  primary  focus  on  such  institutes,  only  then  we  will  be  able  to 

ensure proper infrastructure for such institutes.  My state has NIT Kurukshetra as 

one of the renowned institutes. I would like to request the Government  to provide 

additional  grants  and  funds  for  this  institutes  so  that  proper  development  of  this 

NIT Kurukshetra could take place.
