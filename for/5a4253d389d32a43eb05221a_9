  I  support  the  Admiralty  (Jurisdiction  and 

Settlement)  of  Maritime  Claims  Bill  2016.    The  proposed  legislation  is  likely  to 

consolidate  the  existing  laws  relating  to  admiralty  jurisdiction  of  courts,  arrest  of 

vessels and related issues.  The legislative proposal is likely to fulfill long-standing 

demand  of  the  maritime  legal  fraternity.  This  is  a  welcome  decision  of  the 

Government  to  repeal  the  laws  which  are  not  in  use.   The  admiralty  law  governs 

maritime  questions  and  offences.    The  legislation  now  confers  admiralty 

jurisdiction  on  High  Courts  located  in  all  coastal  States  and  this  jurisdiction 

extends  upto  the  territorial  waters.    The  Government  should  give  an  impetus  for 

enhancing  mercantile  trade  through  focus  on  accelerated  development  of  the 

maritime  infrastructure.    Besides  in  order  to  ensure  security  against  maritime 

claims,  a  vessel  should  be  arrested  in  certain  circumstances  as  lately  there  have 

been  several  instances  when  the  neighbouring  country  encroaches  Indian  area.    I 

support  the  Bill  and  lastly,  I  would  request  the  Government  of  India  to  take  up 

construction  of  Duggirajapatnam  Port  as  mentioned  in  the  Andhra  Pradesh 

Reorganisation  Act  and  also  Ramayapatnam  Port  in  Prakasam  District  of  Andhra 

Pradesh since the Government of India intends to develop a number of major and 

minor ports.
