  I  would  like  to  know  how  could  we  remain 

poor. What are the reasons for poverty and illiteracy? My submission is that even 

today    50.2  per  cent  children  work  all  the  seven  days  in  a  week.  Poverty,  social 

evils, religious fundamentalism breed so many evils. Periyar was right to say that 

in  order  to  eradicate  poverty,  manmade  religion,  hypocrisy,  blind  faith, 

superstitions  should  be  done  away  with.  The  social  evils  are  responsible  for  the 

chronic  poverty  of  the  country.  If  the  Government  at  all  wants  to  introduce  the 

legislation  regarding  child  labour,  the  five  prerequisites  food,  clothes,  education, 

housing,  medical  facilities  should  be  provided  first.  Education  is  very  important. 

At the same time the social evils prevalent in the society should also be eradicated. 

I promise before this august House that there will not be a single incident of child 

labour in  my district until he completes 18. If there is somewhere a case of child 

labour, the local Mukhia, MLA and MP should be held responsible for it. If there is 

any  child  labour  an  FIR  should  be  lodged  against  the  local  MLA  and  MP.  First 

they should be made liable under the legislation.
