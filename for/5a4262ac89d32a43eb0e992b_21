  I  rise  to  support  the  National  Highways  Bill, 

2015.    The  State  Governments  have  not  been  able  to  take  adequate  measures  for 

the  development  and  maintenance  of  Inland  Waterways  due  to  insufficient 

financial outlays, lack of expertise and other pressing priorities.  Thus the Central 

Government  has  to  take  initiatives  to  develop  this  sector.    Switching  to  water 

transpiration would be the most viable option to reduce the dependency on roads, 

particularly for the transportation of bulk and oversized cargo.  In addition to this, 

waterways have lots of tourist potential especially for pilgrimage as many famous 

pilgrim centres located on the river side.  The cost of waterways is barely 50 paisa 

per  kilometres  when  compared  to  Rs.  1  for  Railways  and  Rs.  1.5  for  the  Road 

sector.  It is estimated that the development of the waterways sector would entail 

investment  of  more  than  Rs.  one  lakh  crore  and  around  one  lakh  employment 

opportunities would be created.
