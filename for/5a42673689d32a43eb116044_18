  The  Bureau  of  Indian  Standards  has 

already been addressing many issues. But, with the establishment of the WTO, the 

urgent  need  to  bring  amendments  in  existing  laws  has  been  perceived.  Many 

countries  in  the  word  have  either  rejected  or  imposed  ban  on  Indian  products  on 

the  basis  of  standards.  On  the  other  hand,  the  countries  like  China,  has  played 

every  trick  to  dump  their  substandard  goods  in  Indian  market.  The  sub-standards 

drugs of foreign countries are being sold here. The provision for  setting up DG in 

this bill, for doing on the spot-verification or certification, is a welcome step. The 

public  awareness  created  by  the  Jago  Grahak  Jago  campaign  has  also  made  the 

passing of this bill urgent.
