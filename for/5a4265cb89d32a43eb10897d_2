  The  hon.  Member  has  to  really 

appreciate  that  withdrawal  of  the  Bill  is  one  part  and  another  part  is  introducing 

the new  Bill.   Trade Unions  had been demanding  since  long that the  payment  of 

wages  should  be  done  in  a  transparent  manner  so  that  the  workers  are  not 

exploited.  This Act was passed in 1936.  Major technological transformation has 

come since then.  In the digital process all payments should be made through the 

bank  account  or  through  cheque.    So,  it  is  in  the  interest  of  workers.    We  have 

come to the House for its withdrawal in accordance with the procedure.  You may 

find out small technical reasons but it is really in the interest of the workers and is 

the need of the time.  That is why we had come up with an Ordinance.  Now, the 

Ordinance  has  to  be  replaced  for  which  this  Bill  has  come.    I  think  we  should 

welcome it. 

The Bill, by leave, was withdrawn
