 With the aim of Housing for All by 2022, 

the Central Government has launched a new programme called the PMAY.  I would 

say  that  this  new  programme  is  just  old  wine  in  new  bottle.    The  Government's 

budget allocation for this sector is meager.  I am also happy that there will be 81,757 

houses  constructed  among  which  West  Bengal  will  be  having  27,830  in  38  cities.  

The  main  issue  is  of  non-availability  of  land,  especially  so  in  West  Bengal.    Just 

constructing  a  building  will  not  do,  we  need  to  construct  toilets,  roads,  provide 

water,  sewage  and  transport  facilities, and  also  some  extra  space  also  so  that  these 

houses will become really habitable.
