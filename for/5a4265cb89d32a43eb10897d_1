  I strongly oppose the move to withdraw the Bill but I fully support 

the  contents  of  the  Bill.    The  Government  is  trying  to  withdraw  the  Bill  on  the 

ground that they want to replace the Ordinance by a Bill, by means of a piece of 

legislation  As per Rule 110 (b) there is no provision to withdraw such a Bill.  The 

Rule  110  says  that  the  Member  in  charge of  a  Bill  may, at  any  stage of  the  Bill, 

move  for  leave  to  withdraw  the  Bill  on  the  ground  that  the  legislative  proposal 

contained  in  the  Bill  is  to  be  dropped.    The  Government  is  not  dropping  the 

legislative process of this Bill.  They are pursuing with the Bill.  So, that provision 

is not applicable.  Rule 110 (2) says that the Bill is to be replaced subsequently by 

a new Bill which substantially alters the provisions contained therein.  This is the 

provision  by  which  the  Government  is  going  to  withdraw  the  Bill.    My  point  is, 

there  is  no  material  change  or  substantial  alternation  between  the  Payment  of 

Wages  (Amendment)  Bill,  2016  which  was  introduced  on  15th  December,  2016 

and  the  proposed  Bill  the  Government  want  to  introduce  now.      The  only  new 

clause which has been introduced in the new Bill is Clause 3 which gives effect to 

the  actions  taken  by  the  Government  in  pursuance  of  the  implementation  of  the 

Ordinance.  I do agree with it and fully support it.  My point is according to Rule 

110(2) the Government is not empowered to withdraw a Bill which is not having 

substantial alternations in the provisions of the Bill.  Mere repeal  of Ordinance is 

not a material, substantial alternation of the provisions of the Bill.
