  Standards  are  extremely 

important.  They  affect  the  consumer  and  the  economy.      I  would  like  to 

congratulate the Government and the Hon. Minister for introducing this Bill.   The 

previous  Government  also  recognized  it,  credit  goes  to  them  as  well,  and  they 

referred  it  to  the  Standing  Committee.    The  Standing  Committee  has  given  about 

12 recommendations.  It is heartening to note that despite our political differences, 

in rare situations like this we all come together in the interest of the country.  BIS 

certifies precious metals, especially gold.  The Bill seeks to include standardization 

of services especially healthcare, environment practice, safety and security.   There 

are lakhs of standards.  It is practically impossible for the Government to take the 

sole  responsibility  of  standardization,  implementation  and  monitoring  and 

regulation of standards.  So, it is the responsibility of the industry and other private 

bodies.  The Bill provides for self certification.  Again this a very welcome move.  

the  Bill  gives  rights  to  police  officers  above  the  rank  of  DSP  to  search,  seize 

without  warrant.    Again,  a  welcome  move.    We  support  the  Bill.    BIS  must 

promote  private  testing  laboratories  in  India.    BIS  is  a  short-staffed  and  under-

researched organization.  Many Indian products still fail to get certified because the 

laboratories  are  not  certified.    The  Government  should  focus  on  the  required 

standards for implementing new policies and make huge investment.  Our quality 

standard  for  air  is  not  in  tune  with  the  requirement.    But  I  think  this  Bill  is  very 

important because this Bill, if implemented properly, can add more than 3 per cent 

to  our  GDP.    We  support  the  Bill.    it  affects  the  image  of  India  and  the  pride  of 

India in the global arena.
