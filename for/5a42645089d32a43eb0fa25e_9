  The  State  Governments  had 

appointed  untrained  teachers  under  the  pressure  of  Sarva  Shiksha  Abhiyan  and 

shortage of teachers.  One of the objectives of this Bill is to provide an opportunity 

to  the  teachers  to  acquire  essential  qualification.    Quality  of  teachers  should 

certainly be good then only standards of education will be good.  The Government 

has to formulate a clear-cut policy otherwise untrained teachers working in private 

schools will not get the training.  Our country was the world leader in the field of 

education.    Students  from  across  the  globe  used  to  come  to  India.    The  way  the 

Government  of  Bihar  has  established  Navodaya  Vidyalayas  in  every  districts,  it 

should  establish  training  schools  in  every  district  so  that  the  quality  teachers  are 

available to teach the children.
