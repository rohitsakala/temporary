 We support this Bill on behalf of my 

leader and Biju Janata Dal.  In India, we are still at a very rudimentary level as far 

as  prosthetics  and  connected  development  is  concerned.    In  the  West,  they  are 

developing  limbs  which  can  be  connected  to  the  nerves  which  eventually  get 

connected  to  the  brain.    The  people  who  should  be  benefited  y  this  Bill  should 

actually become a part of society and are truly and honestly accepted by their peers 

as normal human beings.  That is the most important part.  Locomotory problems, 

rheumatoid  arthritis  and  osteoarthritis;  neurological  problems;  brain  tumour  etc 

diseases, which are not included in this and they need to be addressed.  There is no 

mention as to how the District-Level Committee would be formed.  I do not know 

where  this  one  per  cent  reservation  will  come  from.    I  would  like  to  have  some 

clarifications from the hon. Minister.
