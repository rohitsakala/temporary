 It is a reality of our country that we have so far 

not  been  able  to  address  the  problem  of  child  labour  properly.    We  will  have  to 

think differently to tackle this problem because we cannot  tackle this problem by 

merely  enacting  legislations.  We  will have  to construct  big Bal  Bhavans  in  each 

and  every  state  for  orphaned,  hapless  and  destitute  children.    We  should  provide 

them  education  in  these  Bhavans  besides  imparting  them  skill  development 

training.  This way these children will not become a burden on our country rather 

they could prove invaluable assets for our country in future.
