  This piece of legislation 

will make the 1974 India-Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement operational and 

it  allows  swapping  of  land  and  friendly  bilateral  relationship  between  India  and 

Bangladesh.   If  the hon. Minister of  External  Affairs  could  solve  the  other  major 

issue of Teesta waters dispute, we will have a very friendly relationship with our 

most  friendly  neighbour  Bangladesh.    The  issue  of  nationality  of  as  many  as 

54,000  people  living  in  enclaves  has  to  be  settled  by  way  of  this  piece  of 

legislation.  It is very unfortunate that for the last 41 years not even basic amenities 

have been provided to these people.
