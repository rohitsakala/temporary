 This is a good Budget.  My request to the hon. 

Minister  is  that  the  Education  Cess  collected  through  various  States  should  be 

given  back  to  the  concerned  States  for  the  development  of  education  and 

educational infrastructure in those States.  The Government should reduce the rate 

of income tax for the elderly people of above 60 years in the country to a flat 10 

per  cent.   There  is  a need  to promote  affordable  housing  and  real  estate  sector in 

Tier  II  and  Tier  III  cities  in  the  country,  particularly  in  Tamil  Nadu.    In  order  to 

provide cashless economy and transparency, it is proposed to amend Section 80G 

so as to provide that no deduction shall be allowed under Section 80G in respect of 

donation  of  any  sum  exceeding  Rs.  2,000  unless  such  sum  is  paid  by  any  mode 

other than cash.  This will be a landmark decision.  The GST's effect on the entire 

Indian  economy  will  have to be scrutinized in totality  to reach  a  widely  accepted 

conclusion.  Until then manufacturing States like Tamil Nadu should be adequately 

compensated  and  their  losses  for  accepting  and  implementing  GST  should  be 

repaid then and there till the moment of break even is reached. The large drop in 

Tamil  Nadu's  share  in  the  Divisible  Pool  is  barely  compensated.    In  the  last  two 

Union Budgets, many new cesses and surcharges have been levied which reduces 

the  shareable  pool  of  Central  Tax  receipts  and  thereby  the  devolution  to  States.  

Many schemes have been de-linked from Central Assistance.
