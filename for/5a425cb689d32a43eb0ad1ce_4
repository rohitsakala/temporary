      In  order  to  give  effect  to  the  Supreme  Court 

Judgement and Law Commission observations, we always make legislations here.  

Why  do  not  we  make  a  legislation  suo  motu?    It  appears  as  if  Supreme  Court  is 

dictating  us  and  we  are  running  the  administration  as  per  the  Supreme  Court 

directions.  Let us give an impression that the Lok Sabha is supreme.  There is a lot 

of talk whether this alcohol should be part of state GST or Central GST or IGST.  I 

do not  know  what  type  of benefits  the  State  Government  will get  when  the  taxes 

are  not  being  levied  and  not  allowed  to  be  collected  from  the  State  Government.   

Another thing is that we have a lot of pollution problems in our country presently 

because of petrol and diesel emission.  There is a strong proposal from the Minister 

of Petroleum and Natural Gas to allow the alcohol to be mixed with the petrol  as a 

result of which emissions will come down.  It also gives a great relief to the sugar 

growing farmers.  It will also go a long way in addressing not only the ecological 

and emission problems but it will also take care of the problems of farmers.
