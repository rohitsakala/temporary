  Lack  of  information  about  mental 

illness  is  a  very  big  problem.    We  need  to  make  more  efforts  regarding  the 

treatment  of  this  disease.    Also  efforts  need  to  be  made  to  eradicate  this  disease 

and  also  to  bring  down  its  prevalence.    Modern  research  is  needed  for  its 

treatment.    In  this  regard,  foreign  technology  can  be  sought  for  research  in  this 

field.    Keeping  in  view  the  pitiable  condition  of  the  patients  of  this  disease  the 

Government  should  provide  all  basic  facilities  of  life  apart  from  treatment.    In 

Sabarkundla  block  of  my  Constituency,  Amreli,  one  manav  mandir    for  the 

patients  has  been  set  up.    I  have  provided  Rs.10-15  lakh  from  my  MPLAD  fund 

for  this.    We  need  to  make  provision  to  make  the  patients  self-dependent  after 

treatment and to bring them in the mainstream of the society.
