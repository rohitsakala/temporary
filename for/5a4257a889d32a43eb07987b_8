    I  congratulate  the  hon. 

Minister for trying to implement as many labour laws as possible.  A special order 

should  be  issued  that  along  with  the  drinking  water,  cleanliness  should  also  be 

taken care of.  First Aid Box is missing in several factories.  This aspect should be 

considered.    Whenever  there  is  a  major  case  or  accidents  take  place,  as  a  special 

case,  the  Labour  Courts  may  conduct  the  hearings  of  the  cases  in  the  premises 

itself.  This will help the employees.  Whenever there is a dispute, the Government 

should  insist  on  tripartite  consultations  in  all  factories.    Another  point  is,  the 

inspection  done  by  the  labour  inspectors  could  be  made  more  transparent.    With 

regard to pregnant women and disabled women not being able to enter into tankers 

and chambers, we appreciate the Government for including appropriate provisions 

in the Bill. As far as employing of women before 7.00 a.m. and after 6.00 p.m. in 

factories located in SEZ is concerned, it is good. But it should be done with proper 

security.   We have a textile factory in Andhra Pradesh. This is run by the National 

Textiles  Corporation.    The  Government  should  give  proper  guidance  so  that  the 

machinery  is updated  and  the  working  conditions improved. In  the  Bill, there  are 

provisions regarding canteen, shelters, rest rooms and lunch rooms.  So, wherever 

more  than  20  workers  are  employed  in  a  factory,  providing  of  canteen,  shelters, 

rest  rooms  and  lunch  rooms  should  be  made  mandatory.    Yesterday,  the  hon. 

Minister  was  mentioning  about  providing  help  to  the  school  run  by  the  mica 

factory at Kalichedu.  I would request him to consider extending help to this school 

and  provide  consolidated  pay  to  the  seven  teachers  who  are  there  to  help  150 

students in the only school which is run by the Ministry of Labour in Kalichedu.
