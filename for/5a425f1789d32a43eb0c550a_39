 Implementation of G.S.T. system 

will result in the rise of G.D.P. ratio in the country. Its implementation will not 

only make the procedure of tax payment easy but also curb tax evasion. All the 

indirect taxes will be included in this bill as a result making tax system simple 

and transparent and ultimately prove beneficial not only to the states and centre 

but  also  to  commerce  and  trade  sectors.  This  Bill  will  strengthen  the  growing 

economy of our developing country.
