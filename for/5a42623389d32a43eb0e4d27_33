  Child  labour  is    a  highly  social  evil 

and  the  root  cause  of  child  labour  is  poverty.  Bonded  labour  is  a  hidden 

phenomenon  as  a  majority  of  the  children  are  engaged  in  it  and  it  is  a  form  of 

slavery. Our Act of Right to Education is nullified by child labour and our efforts 

for  giving  mid-day  meal  are  nullified  by  child  labour.  When  the  Mid-Day  Meal 

Scheme was started, it was for the children to go to the school, get education and 

have food.  The Child Labour Technical Advisory Committee should monitor the 

injustice  faced by  the  children  by  taking care  of  their  working  hours, their  health 

and safety, getting proper rest and getting holiday in a week. This Committee  has 

to  take  all  the  steps  for  the  welfare  of  the  children  and  take  strict  action  against 

those people who do not follow the law.  I request the Government to send the Bill 

to the Select Committee to make the Bill child-friendly.
