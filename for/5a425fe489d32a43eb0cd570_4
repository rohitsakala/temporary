 It appears that due to non-availability 

of  caste-wise  data,  it  was  not  possible  to  give  a  precise  estimate  of  expenditure 

which  might  be  incurred.    I  would  request  the  hon.  Minister  that  Government 

should  conduct  a  caste-wise  survey  in  order  to  determine  such  expenditure.    The 

Government  of  West  Bengal  has  already  issued  near  about  13-lakh  caste 

certificates,  and  then  online  procedure  has  also  been  introduced  to  expedite  the 

process.    It  is  evident  that  with  inclusion  of  more  castes,  the  Government  will 

require  more  funds to  make  sure that  every  such  member  is  enabled to  access  all 

opportunities and facilities.  So, I would like to request the hon. Minister that the 

Government may consider it beneficial to revise the fund allocation meant for the 

welfare of Scheduled Caste communities.
