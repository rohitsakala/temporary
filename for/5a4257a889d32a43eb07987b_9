  I  rise  to  support  this  Bill.  I 

welcome  the  amendment  proposed  for  overtime  in  the  Bill  because  no  one  ever 

gave  it  a  thought  ever  since  the  year  1987.  Several  hon.  Members  citing  the  Bill 

introduced  in  the  year  2014,  termed  it  anti-labour.  I  do  not  find  any  anti-labour 

clause  in  the  Bill.  There  is  no  provision  in  the  Bill  which  makes  overtime 

mandatory for any labourer. The time limit of fifty hours has been extended in the 

Bill and I do not think the labour force would have any problem with it. Most of 

the people are  anxious because of growing unemployment in the country but I do 

not think overtime clause would create the problem of unemployment. It would not 

affect    the  unemployed  persons.  In  a  small  state  like  Assam,  there  are 

approximately 25 lakh unemployed youth. The reasons for this unemployment rate 

should  be  looked  into.  I  feel  that  the  steps  taken  by  the  NDA  Government  to 

promote  self  employment  and  entrepreneurship  under  the  Skill  Development 

scheme and setting up a Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship  and 

strengthening it financially by allocating Rs. 12 thousand crore would help resolve 

the  problem  of  unemployment  to  some  extent.  The  condition  of  tea  gardens  in 

West  Bengal  and  Assam  since  Independence  should  also  be  looked  into.  The 

working condition of labour force there is very bad. If the labour force would work 

overtime  they  will  be  paid  for  it.  This  aspect  would  be  covered  under  Jan  Dhan 

Yojana  and  Atal  Pension  Yojana.  The  maximum  limit  of  pension  has  been  made 

Rs.  1000/-.  I  want  that  the  Government  should  also  do  something  about  the 

remaining unorganised labour force.
