 Such a big merger is being carried out, 

but  is  our  Ministry  fully  prepared  with  the  equipments  to  run  such  an 

infrastructure?  We are taking this step to fight in a global environment and I have 

an apprehension that such a big merger may turn out too big to handle. Are we not 

going to make a good bank bad by consolidating the bad banks?  The rural areas in 

India do not have the facility of the banking sector.  Wherever there is overlapping 

of  bank  branches,  they  will  be  closed  down  and  only  one  branch  of  a  bank  will 

remain.  I think that as a result of this merger, the private banks, be it HDFC, ICICI 

or  any  other  bank,  will  have  the  benefit.    It  is  necessary  that  such  a  big 

infrastructure  be  set  up  by  the  Government  to  be  competitive  for  global 

environment so that in the times to come, the State Bank of India might be able to 

extend  financial  support  wherever  required  in  a  global  environment.    The 

Government must keep a vigil that banks may not fail due to this too big to handle 

merger.  I support this Bill.
