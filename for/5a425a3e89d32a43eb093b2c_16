 Footwear and leather sector has been existing 

since many years in India and it has been evolving over the years.  India ranks 3rd 

globally  after  China  and  Vietnam  with  regard  to  export  of  leather  products 

including  footwear.    But  still  there  is  a  dearth  of  institutes  for  the  development 

leather  industry  in  India.    Even  in  Maharashtra  or  Mumbai,  no  institute  has  been 

set  up  till  date  whereas  leather  and  footwear  industry  has  maximum  presence  in 

Mumbai.  Leather products are exported to the stores in US, UK and Europe from 

the Dharavi of Mumbai.  So, through you, I would like to request the Government 

that a Leather Footwear Design and Development Institute should be set up in the 

Dharavi  area  of  Mumbai  which  is  essential  for  leather  industry  and  footwear 

development.
