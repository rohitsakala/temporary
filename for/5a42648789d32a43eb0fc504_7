  We  know  that  bio-technology  is 

gradually increasing throughout the world.  We are having a population of 18 per 

cent but till now we engage only two per cent amount of money in the field of bio-

technology.    In  the  Budget  of  2015-16,  the  allocation  to  this  sector  was  only  a 

meagre sum of Rs. 7,288 crore.  For boosting the production of generic medicines, 

for  boosting  agricultural  production  and  productivity  of  our  country, for  boosting 

energy  production  and  water  supply  in  our  country,  biotechnology  plays  a  very 

important  role.    I  hope  the  Government  would  look  into  the  matter  in  all 

seriousness and see that biotechnology advances in our country in the near future.
