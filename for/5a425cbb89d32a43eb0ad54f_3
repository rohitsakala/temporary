  The  object  of  the  Bill  regarding  the  10 

years  addition  for  being  eligible  for  pension  for  the  lawyers  was  very  much 

needed.   On  the point  of  appointment of  judges, we  are not getting good lawyers 

because of the collegium function is not properly done till now.  In the collegium 

system, if he likes the person, then the person is good and if he does not like the 

person, then he is bad.  So, the collegium system has failed.  If required, you may 

call  for  a  national  debate  on  this  subject  as  to  what  should  be  the  appointment 

procedure of the judges in the High Court and the Supreme Court. Regarding the 

salary  of  the  judges,  this  is  really  a  small  amount.    At  the  same  time,  I  would 

request  the  hon.  Law  Minister  to  constitute  a  Judicial  Commission  to  fix  up  the 

salaries of judges.  So far as infrastructure is concerned.  There are a large number 

of  vacancies  in  the  country.    Immediate  steps  should  be  taken  to  fill  up  the 

vacancies  in  every  district  and  in  every  State.    Again,  I  would  request  to  make  a 

law  that  after  their  retirement,  the  judges  will  not  be  accommodated  in  any 

position.    This  should  apply  to  IAS  officers  also.  Another  suggestion  is  that  if 

lawyers are to be appointed as judges, appoint them at least when they are 45 years 

old.    But  why  at  the  age  of  60  just  for  two  years  for  the  purpose  of  giving  them 

pension  just  after  two  years?    It  should  not  be  done.    Regarding  circuit  bench,  I 

would request the hon. Minister to make a constitutional amendment. If door-step 

justice has  to  be delivered, then  the  Circuit  Bench of the  Supreme  Court  must be 

there in all the regions of this country.
