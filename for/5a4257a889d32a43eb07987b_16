    In  the  last 

year,  the  Government  of  India  gave  thousands  of  crores  rupees  back  to  the 

labourers  and  the  remaining  amount  was  spent  towards  the  welfare  of  the 

labourers.  Through this Bill, it has been provided to enhance the overtime hours, 

allow  the  women  to  work  during  the  night  and  provide  security  to  them.    It  will 

give  a  fillip  to  the  industries.    If  the  laws  which  hamper  the  progress  of  the 

industries are replaced by a better law it will encourage the industries and generate 

employment opportunities.
