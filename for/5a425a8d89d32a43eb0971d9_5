  I  rise 

to  support 

the  Election  Laws 

(Amendment)  Bill, 2016.   I  would  like  to  bring  to  the  notice of  the  Minister  that 

though  the  A.P.  Reorganization  Act  which  was  passed  in  2014,  we  are  yet  to get 

the necessary amendments to go through the delimitation exercise in both Andhra 

Pradesh  and  Telangana.    It  requires  a  Constitution  Amendment  for  that,  or  an 

amendment  to  the  A.P.  Reorganization  Act.    So,  I  beseech  the  Government  to 

please  consider  this  and  to  do  it  at  the  earliest.    I  would  like  to  also  bring  to  the 

notice of the House that Non-Resident Indians who retain their Indian citizenship 

around the world are not given this right to vote.  So, I would like to urge upon the 

Government to consider giving voting rights to NRIs.
