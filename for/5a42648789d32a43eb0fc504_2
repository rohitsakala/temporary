  I  wholeheartedly  welcome  this  Bill.    Our 

participation in the field of biotechnology has increased at the international level.  

It is obvious that there is no need to explain the importance of this Bill.  In the year 

2009,  this  Regional  Center  of  Biotechnology  was  opened  by  an  executive  order.  

So,  it  is  therefore  natural  that  the  governing  body  or  the  controlling  body  of  the 

Center is that of Union Government.  Until we make it a statutory body, it cannot 

have  much  sanctity.    Moreover,  the  institution  set  up  by  an  executive  order  does 

not have full autonomy and works on the sweet will of the Government of India.  

Today, the Hon. Minister has given it the legislative backing by this Bill.  With the 

passage  of  this  Bill, this  regional  center will  enjoy  full  autonomy  with  powers  to 

make  rules  for  its  self  regulation.   The  Government of  India is  going to give  this 

regional  center  a  legislative  right.    Good  work  is  being  done  in  the  field  of 

biochemistry, biophysics and industrial biology.  This Bill will not only empower 

the governing body to take its own decision but will also make it more independent 

in  decision  making  after  its  being    more  autonomous  through    this  legislation. 

Besides, our biotechnology centre of Faridabad in Haryana is of national level but 

it will be a centre of international level in the future.
