  Priority  has  been  given  to 

agriculture  sector  farmers  and  under  privilege  in  this  year's  budget.    During  the 

tenure  of  this  government  agriculture  growth  rate  has  increased  to  4.1  percent 

which  shows  that  how  serious  is  this  government  for  welfare  of  farmers  and 

development  of  agriculture.   Allocation  for  agriculture has been  increased  almost 

7,000 crore during this year in comparison to 2016-17.  A provision of 9,000 crore 

have  been  made  for  Pradhan  Mantri  Fasal  Bima  Yojana.    The  government  has 

proposed  to  dig  ten  lakh  ponds  it  will  enable  farmers  to  irrigate  their  fields  and 

fishing.    Government  propose  to  establish  laboratories  in  all  648  Krishi  Vigyan 

Kendras.  A micro irrigation fund has been created with a corpus of Rs. 5,000 crore 

so  that  target  of  more  crop  per  drop  can  be  achieved.    A  provision  of  Rs.  7377 

crore has been made for Pradhan Mantri Sinchai Yojana.  Under MNREGA 5 lakh 

ponds will be constructed in rural areas to solve the problem of drought.  Ceiling of 

small  marginal  farmer  is  one  and  half  times  more  than  any  other  area  in 

Bundelkhand.    I  would  like  to  request  the  government  that  farmers  having  more 

than 20 acres of land should be treated as marginal farmers in Bundelkhand region 

and farmers having less than 20 acres of land should be provided benefits of small 

marginal farmers.  Compensation for natural disasters should be provided equally 

to all with this I support the demands for grants of the Ministry of Agriculture.
