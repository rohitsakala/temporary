  I  support  this  Bill.    Clause  6  is  regarding 

the  'informed  consent'.    If  the  healthcare  provide  strongly  suspects  that  HIV  is 

present, can  such  a  provision  be  added  wherein  the  health  provider  can  go  ahead 

and take the test without informed consent?  The Government should remove "as 

far as possible" in Clause 14 and make it for all patients?  Clause 10 relates to duty 

to  prevent  transmission  of  HIV.    Why  can  the  Government  not  add  some 

punishment  provisions?    The  foreign  NGOs  were doing  HIV  prevention services.  

Now, it has declined a lot.  Will this Government enhance budgetary spending for 

this?  One major reason of death in HIV is presence of infection such as TB.  India 

has a very high prevalence of TB.  So, the Government should also strengthen TB 

services and the ICT services.
