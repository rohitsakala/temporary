  I would like to thank the hon. Prime 

Minister  who  have  taken  several  decisions  for  the  welfare  of  the  farmers  in 

consonance of  his vision of a prosperous India.    In the  Union Budget of  2017-18 

several  effective  and  meaningful  steps  have  been  taken  for  the  welfare  of  the 

farmers and to make them self-reliant.  An allocation of Rs. 10 lakh crore has been 

made in this Union Budget for doubling the income of farmers.  There is a need to 

start  several  other  awareness  programmes  for  the  farmers  and  also  for  making 

further  allocation  for  the  purpose  of  digging  the  canals  and  erecting  tubewells.  

There  is  a  need  to  take  government  measures  for  encouraging  the  use  of  Vermi 

compost fertilizers in place of chemical fertilizers in order to safeguard our lives as 

well as the environment.  There is need to provide loan at the lower rate of interest 

for the farm equipments and tractors.  I would like to demand from the government 

for providing better MSP to the farmers.  I would like to urge the hon. Minister for 

providing additional assistance to Jharkhand to provide relief to the farmers of the 

state.
