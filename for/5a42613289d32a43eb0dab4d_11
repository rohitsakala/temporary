    I  rise  to  support  the  Constitution 

(Scheduled  Castes) Order  (Amendment)  Bill, 2017.   The  people belonging  to  the 

Scheduled  Castes  category  have  been  completed  exploited  for  political  ends  and 

have been confined to vote bank status by the Governments that have ruled during 

these  70  years.   The  Schemes  launched  for  them  were  never  implemented  on  the 

ground.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  Government  for  raising  the  fund  of  the 

Scheduled Castes Sub Plan. Rs.38,833 crore had been allocated last time which has 

been  raised  to  Rs.52,393  crore.    Similarly,  the  amount  under  the  Tribal  Sub  Plan 

have  also  been  raised  from  Rs.24,005  crore  to  Rs.31,920  crore.    This  is  good 

because  until  the  Scheduled  castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  people  get  funds,  they 

would  not  be  able  to  economically  move  ahead  and  their  social  status  will  also 

remain static.  I would like to thank the government for bringing in amendment in 

the Atrocities Act.
