  Today,  we  are  establishing  six  new  IITs  of 

national importance.  You have catered to the needs of Jammu.  If possible, set up 

an  IIT  in  the  valley  also.    It  would  be  a  very  welcome  step.    The  name  of  IIT 

Bombay should be changed to IIT Mumbai.  There is not a single student who has 

passed for the IIT examination without attending private classes.  The government 

is providing free education to SCs and STs.  Even those whose income is not even 

one  lakh  per  year  are  also  getting  free  education.    Those  with  income  between 

between  one  lakh  to  five  lakhs  they  have  to  pay  two-thirds  of  the  fee  i.e. 

Rs.70,000.  For this we should especially be thankful to the Government.  So far as 

I  know  that  nearly  ten  per  cent  of  the  students  drop  out  from  the  Engineering 

Colleges.  Those who pass out dream of going abroad.  The second problem is that 

of brain drain.  We have to pay attention to the aspect also.  Some faculties  have 

become  outdated.   Now  chemical  technology  is  down.  We  have  to  pay  attention 

regarding the need for new faculties.  The syllabi of CBSE, ICSC and that of the 

Boards  are  different  due  to  which  the  students  cannot  sit  in  that  exam  since  the 

syllabus is not the same.  The Government should set up more and more institutes 

and provide more and more funds.
