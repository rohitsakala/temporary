 At that time only I had said that if you 

had referred  the Bill to the standing committee it would have been passed within 

2-3  days  but  you  did  not  pay  any  heed  to  it.  The  Bill  was  sent  to  the  select 

committee by the Rajya Sabha and  amendments were made to it and it has come 

back for our consideration here. Any good suggestion by the opposition should be 

accepted in a functional Parliamentary Democracy. The Bill should be referred to 

the Standing Committee whether they belong to Coal Mining or any other subject. 

If you had adopted this procedure it would have saved time and the Bill also could 

have been passed. Therefore, I would like to remind the same.
