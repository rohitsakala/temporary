  I  have  risen  in  the  House in the  support  of this 

Bill.  In last 10-15 years, it was an era of defaulters and loot was rampant as there 

was  no  watchman  in  the  country.    NPAs  have  risen  to  about  8  lakh  crores  of 

rupees.  But this Bill will provide great relief and assistance in this regard.  I would 

like to suggest to hon. Minister of Finance that the number of Presiding Officers is 

very  less  and  I  had  given  this  suggestion  to  the  Standing  Committee  as  well  to 

assign  this  job  to  the  senior  advocates  as  this  will  help  resolve  70,000  pending 

cases  in  DRTs.    Earlier,  there  was  one  method  to  give  loans  to  the  willful 

defaulters  and  another  method  to  give  loans  to  other  people  as  there  was  no 

watchman or security person over there.  Now, there is only one method for all and 

this will remove all the problems.
