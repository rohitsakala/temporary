  As  far  as  the  intension  of  the 

government is concerned to bring out this Bill and also the need of the Bill, it is all 

right.    Many  efforts  were  made  earlier  also  for  recovery  of  debts  and  some  laws 

were also enacted but they did not proved to be effective.  I believe that there is a 

need  for  classification  of  NPAs  so  as to identify  the  people  responsible  for  it.   If 

this  subject  is  studied  properly  then  some  big  names  will  emerge.    This  is  a  fact 

that  agriculture  sector  is  the  backbone  of  our  economy.    But  in  no  sector  any 

suicides  are  being  committed,  it  is  only  agriculture  sector  wherein  farmers  are 

committing suicides.  I would like to know whether the government is making any 

efforts for one time settlement of the loans of farming sector.  Unless the economy 

of agriculture sector improves, the GDP of our country cannot increase.
