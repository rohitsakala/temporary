  Actually, Right  to  Education  is  the dream 

of  Dr.  Baba  Saheb  Ambedkar.    So,  I  think  we  are  all  taking  his  dream  forward.  

Everybody  has  talked  about  qualified teachers.   Maharashtra definitely  does have 

qualified  teachers  but  I  think  we  need  to  take  our  teachers  in  Maharashtra  to  the 

next level, which is not just about giving them degrees of qualification but bringing 

in  awareness  for  the  teachers  of  different  challenges  that  today's  students  are 

having.  Just giving the teachers a degree is not good enough.  Sensitizing them is 

more  important.    The  whole  message  of  Sarva  Shiksha  Abhiyan  is  to  make  it  an 

inclusive education to all.  The Government has to bring in one more amendment 

in the Right to Education Act to extend it from 6-14 years to 6-18 years.  The laws 

are made but not implemented properly.  Skilling has to be genuinely inclusive. A 

child,  who  may  be  weak  in  English,  may  be  weak  in  Maths  or  may  be  weak  in 

Science,  but  it  is  the  teacher  who  has  to  understand  what  the  child  is  good  at  or 

what his or her  strengths  and  weaknesses  are.   That really  makes  a good teacher.  

The quality of teachers' training is very important because that is what really builds 

the true nation.
