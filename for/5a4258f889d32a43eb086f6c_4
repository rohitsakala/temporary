  We  are  happy  that  through  this  step 

Andhra  Pradesh,  which  is  not  really  a  new  State,  will  see  further  development.  

These days, these times are times when we should be talking about energy synergy.  

There is a need to harness the potential of both conventional as well as renewable 

sources of energy.  Our dependence on fossil fuels needs to be challenged.  People 

should be encouraged to increase their dependence on renewable energy.  I have a 

suggestion.  Just  call  this  Institute,  the  Indian  Institute  of  Energy.    While  the 

proposed  university  can  work  towards  developing  better  technology,  involving 

renewable energy, it should simultaneously work towards reducing our dependence 

on hydrocarbons.  I would suggest that all the related institutes should be brought 

together under one umbrella.  They may be mandated to work on methods how to 

get  rid  of  those  which  pollute  the  atmosphere  and  whose  use  damages  the  earth.  

Therefore,  move  away  from  those  sources  of  energy  into  alternative  energy.    In 

these  institutes  research  would  be  focused  on  finding  new  renewable  sources  of 

energy and encouraging their adoption throughout the country.  Even the General 

Council has members only from hydrocarbon industry who will obviously not like 

the  country  to  move  to  renewable  energy.    The  membership  composition  implies 

that  traditional  thought  and  traditional  mindset  will  not  only  continue,  it  shall  be 

further strengthened with private enterprise.
