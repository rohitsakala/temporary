  I  would  like  to  thank  the 

Government  for  increasing  allocation  of  funds  for  2017-18.    The  allocation  for 

Agricultural  Ministry  is  Rs.51206  crore.    As  mentioned  in  the  Budget  a  Micro-

Irrigation  fund  under  National  Bank  for  Agricultural  development  will  be  set  up 

with initial corpus of Rs.5000 crores and an agricultural credit target of Rs.10 lakh 

crore has been fixed.  The Government has proposed to increase to double farmers 

income  and  for  this  purpose,  Government  has  also  implemented  many  schemes.  

The farmers are committing suicide everyday in the country and rate of suicide is 

increasing.  For this purpose, Government has proposal to waive farmers loan. The 

Government has also decided to open one Krishi Vigyan Kendra in every district.  

But  now  this  Krishi  Vigyan  Kendra  is  being  neglected  and  research  work  has 

stopped.    I  request  the  Government  to  give  attention  and  financial  assistance  for 

their  better  functioning.    In  my  constituency,  ONGC  is  operating  oil  wells  and 

ONGC has under taken survey work and fishing is ban at the time of survey work.  

I, therefore, demand to give compensation to the fishermen.
