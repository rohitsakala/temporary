  Admiralty  jurisdiction  till  now  is 

restricted to three High Courts and it is now extended to all the High Courts of the 

maritime States.  This Act is going to repeal about five obsolete statutes dated back 

to  1840,  1861,  1890,  1891  and  1865  and  a  consolidated  law  is  being  enacted  for 

efficient  governance.    The  Government  of  India  is  very  much  interested  in 

encouraging  the  development  of  sea  ports.    I  would  request  the  Government  of 

India to  extend  assistance  for  establishing  ports  at  Ramayapatnam, Bhavanapadu, 

Kalingapatnam, etc.  With these words, I support the Bill.
