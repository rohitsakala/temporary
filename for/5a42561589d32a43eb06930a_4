  I  rise  to  support  The  Indian 

Trusts(Amendment)  Bill,  2015.    Public  Trust  Act,  1860  has  been  in  vogue  in 

Maharashtra.    Any  institution  registered  under  that  Act  whether  it  is  a  public 

committee, institution, temple or any public trust has a wealth to the tune of crores 

of rupees.  There is a need to benefit the common man from that money.  It is the 

need of the hour that the government takes control of the management of all these 

trusts.    The  government  has  paid  attention  towards  it  while  omitting  section  20.  

This bill is not going to adversely impact any person who is competent to sign an 

agreement  with  the  trust  and  complies  with  provision  of  the  trust  deed  and 

directions.  I would like to thank the government for this regard.
