  The Bill seeks to amend a 

133-year old, Indian Trusts Act, 1882.  It also outlines the manner in which surplus 

fund of the trust may be invested for future use and benefit of the trust.  This Bill 

also proposes to delete some pre-Independence references to outdated and obsolete 

securities  from  the  Indian  Trusts  Act,  1882.    It  may  be  recalled  that  the  Law 

Commission of India in its 17th report, had earlier recommended for amending the 

Section  20.    The  Bill  proposes  to  confer  greater  autonomy  and  flexibility  on 

trustees  of  private  trusts  as  regards  investment  on  trust  money.    The  proposed 

changes  are  consistent  with  the  current  economic  environment.    The  Centre  has 

taken an important step towards enabling private trust funds to be parked in listed 

shares  and  specified  debt  securities.    Under  Common  Law,  a  trust  is  an 

arrangement  under  which  the  settler  entrusts  his  property  to  certain  persons  or 

trustees,  who  become  the  legal  owners  of  the  trust  property  but  hold  it  for  the 

benefit of third parties, that is the beneficiaries.  The Act extends to private trusts 

only  and  not  to  public  trusts.    Nonetheless,  Indian  courts  have  held  certain 

provisions applicable to public trusts as well.  A private trust's beneficiaries are a 

closed group, while a public trust for the benefit of a larger cross-section having a 

public  purpose.    There  are  thousands  of  trusts  in  India  that  include  religious  and 

charitable  trusts  managing  large  sums  of  money.    Employee  welfare  trusts  also 

have substantial funds.  Some of these attitudes have changed in the past two years 

or so, largely driven by the advent of professional wealth managers.
