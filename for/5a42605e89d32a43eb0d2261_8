  On  behalf  of  the  Telangana 

Rashtra Samiti, I stand to support this Bill.  I was adjunct faculty member teaching 

Electrical  Engineering  and  I  interviewed  more  than  3,000  Electrical  Engineers  in 

the last 25 years.  The quality has really become abysmal.  But if you ask them the 

simple  question  whether  there  is  current  because  of  voltage  or  whether  there  is 

voltage  because  of  current,  most  of  them  do  not  know.    Even  the  ordinary 

electricians know more and that is the gap between theory and practice.  Some of 

our  apprentices  who  are  school  dropouts  are  better  than  some  of  our  mechanical 

engineers.  Now-a-days there are shops which sell projects and also project reports.  

The Government of Telangana recognized that many engineering colleges, instead 

of making the future of students bright, they are destroying.  Engineers today are 

among  the  most  unemployable.    So,  I  am  very  proud  to  say  that  our  State  has 

actually closed down 174 engineering colleges which are sub-standard and wasting 

life of students.  I think we need to take such pro-active steps at the national level. 

Research  is not about  compilation  of  Knowledge but  creation of new knowledge. 

The  data  is  the  raw  material  for  creation  of  new  knowledge  and  that  is  no 

accessible  because  of  multiple  laws  relating  to  security  and  so  many  other 

departments. Some of these barriers of collection of data need to be removed. The 

cost  of  education  is  important.  If  you  are  increasing  fee  please  ensure  that  no 

deserving student is denied because of lack of funds. There is a need to bring the 

industry  into  the  institution  and  take  the  institution  to  the  industry  through 

apprenticeship system and that will really help the quality of engineering.
