  Some  communities  had 

been  ostracized  from  the  rest  of  the  communities.    They  were  treated  as 

untouchables.    For  several  centuries  they  were  oppressed  and  suppressed.    They 

were  not  given  the  human  dignity.    Therefore,  to  compensate  whatever  injustice 

had been done to them,  the Constitution had included some castes in SC/ST List.  

We  keep  on  adding  new  communities  into  the  List.    Therefore,  to  do  justice  to 

these suppressed and oppressed people, new communities need not be added to the 

List of SC/ST at least in future.
