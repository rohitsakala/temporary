 Special allocations have been made 

for  the  Ministry  of  Defence  in  the  budget  of  2017-18  to  make  our  country 

powerful.  Security scenario in our neighbouring South Asian countries presents a 

mixed picture.  We have faced many wars with Pakistan in recent years.  In view 

of these wars, we have been concentrating on our security  vis-a-vis Pakistan only 

but  we  need  to  make  our  approach  China  centric.  For  this,  the  Government  has 

raised a Mountain Strike Corps.  Construction of roads and airports in border areas 

is  an  important  step.    Procurement  procedures  for  forces  have  been  simplified.  

Attempts  are  being  made  to  attract  direct  investment  and  technology  to 

manufacture  armament  under  Make-in-India.    The  demand  of  One  Rank,  One 

Pension has been accepted.  Defence budget has been increased by 10 per cent in 

view  of  external  and  internal  security.    Provision  for  modernization  of  the  three 

services has been made in the budget.  Besides economic resources, moral boosting 

is also very important to strengthen the forces of any country.  Recently, our Army 

conducted  a  surgical  strike  with  valour.    I,  through  this  House,  congratulate  our 

Army for this successful surgical strike.
