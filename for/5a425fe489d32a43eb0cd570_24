  I  express  my  gratitude  to  the  hon. 

Minister  for  bringing  such  a  laudable  Bill.    Large  number  of  members  have 

demanded the inclusion of more castes in the scheduled castes list.   However, first 

the  Government  should  increase  the  reservation  quota  for  the  scheduled  castes.  

Out  of  22  per  cent  reservation  scheduled  castes  are  getting  only  19  per  cent.  

Similar is the case with the backward castes.  Out of 27 per cent reservation, they 

are getting only 5 per cent.  The Congress Party was in power for 50-55 years but 

did not install a single statue of Baba Saheb anywhere in the country.  If any party 

did  this  it  is  the  BJP.    The  hon.  Prime  Minister  called  a  special  session  of  Lok 

Sabha  68  years  after  Independence  in  honour  of  Baba  Saheb  Dr.  Bhim  Rao 

Ambedkarji.  If any party has honoured scheduled castes it is the BJP.  The Uttar 

Pradesh Government is committing atrocities on scheduled castes.
