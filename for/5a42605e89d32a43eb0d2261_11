  There is a need to open IIT 

like  institutions  and  expand  educational  facilities  in  rural  areas.  IITs  should  be 

promoted. This is the age of digitalization and India has to be taken forward on this 

path of digitization. Therefore, we should expect maximum contribution from the 

Government.  There  is  a  need  to  set  up  more  and  more  permanent  campuses  and 

allocation  of  funds  should  also  be  enhanced.  The  number  of  seats  should  also  be 

increased.  Poor  children  should  be  given  more  opportunities.  The  process  should 

be  simplified.    IT  parks  should  be  set  up  at  Patna,  Bhagalpur,  Gaya,  Darbhanga, 

Munger  and  Muzaffarpur.  I  demand  that  a  new  IIT  should  be  set  up  in  my 

constituency Banka and Jamui. More and more expansion of BPOs should be done 

so  that  it  could  result  in  setting  up  more  call  centres,  thereby,  leading  to  more 

employment  opportunities.  More  and  more  IT  based  services  should  be  created, 

e.g.  promotion  of  online  shopping  etc.  so  that  more  employment  opportunities 

could  be  created.  Wifi  facilities  should  be  made  available  at  the  educational 

institutes and other public places.
