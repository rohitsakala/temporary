  For inclusion or deletion of a caste in the list of Scheduled Castes or 

Scheduled  Tribes,  the  State  Government  has  to  send  a  proposal  to  the  Central 

Government according to Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution.  This Bill has 

been  brought  before  this  House  after  following  all  these  procedures.    There  are 

only  two  things  in  this  Bill.    The  Odisha  Government  has  proposed  to  include 

Sualgiri  community  as  a  synonym  of  Sabakhiya  community  entered  at  serial  No. 

79  in  the  list  of  Scheduled  Castes.    The  other  proposal  is  to  substitute  the  word 

'Pondicherry'  with  the  word  'Pudducherry'  in  the  Constitution  (Pondicherry) 

Scheduled Castes Order, 1964 consequent upon the change in name of the Union 

Territory from Pondicherry to Pudducherry.  This Bill was introduced in the House 

on 10th March, 2017.  I request the hon. Members to consider the Bill and pass it.
