  It  was  the  Atal  Bihari  Vajpayee 

government  that  made  first  attempt  to  realize  the  dreams  of  Dr.  Bhimrao 

Ambedkar.    Today,  under  the  able  leadership  of  Modiji,  the  present  government 

has  taken  so  many  steps  during  the  last  three  years  that  are  mainly  intended  to 

benefit  the  poor  including  SCs  and  STs.   Be  it  the  Jan  Dhan  Yojana  or  Ujjawala 

Yojana or scheme for distribution of LED bulbs or any scheme for the matter have 

benefitted  80  to  90  per  cent  people  of  these  communities  and  their  effect  is  also 

visible on the ground.  India is also marching forward in the direction of achieving 

MDG and sustainable goals.
