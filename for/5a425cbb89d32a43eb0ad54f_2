  Poor  people  will  get  justice  only  when  395 

vacancies  of  Judges  are  filled  up  in  the  High  Courts.    Today,  good  advocates  do 

not  want  to  become  Judges.    Therefore,  this  is  a  serious  question  before  the 

Government  as  to  how  to  attract  good  advocates  to  become  Judges.    The 

Government  should  also  seriously  think  to  increase  the  number  of  Judges  in  the 

High  Courts  and  lower  courts.    The  states  which  should  have  more  benches  of 

High  Courts,  actually  have  very  few.    Therefore,  I  would  request  the  Union 

Government to set up atleast four new benches of High Court in U.P. which has a 

population of 22 crore.  Meerut, Agra, Gorakhpur, Banaras and Bundelkhand can 

be considered for opening new  four benches of High Court.  I would also request 

the  hon.  Minister  of  Law  and  Justice  to  open  the  first  bench  of  High  Court  in 

Meerut  because  the  largest  number  of  cases  pending  in  Allahabad  High  Court 

relates to Meerut region.  The Judicial Accountability Bill also needs to be brought 

up.  Today, the police has got a time limit of 60-90 days for investigation of a case, 

failing  which  the  accused  is  bailed  out.    Can't  we  set  the  same  example  for  our 

courts?    Can't  we  set  a  timeline  for  our  Courts  to  decide  the  cases?    Justice 

Malimath Committee report should be implemented at the earliest.
