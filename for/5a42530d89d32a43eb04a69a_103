  The  government  is  working  for  the 

poor and farmers.  With a view to increase credit flow in the agriculture sector, the 

target  for  agriculture  loan  has  been  enhanced  from  one  lakh  crore  rupees  to  ten 

lakh crore rupees.  Besides for the financial year 2017-18 the target of agriculture 

loan  has  been  increased  from  9  lakh  crores  rupees  to  10  lakh  crore  rupees.    The 

amount  allocated  for  irrigation  under  NABARD  has  been  enhanced  from  30 

thousand  crore  rupees  to  40  thousand  crore  rupees.    The  MNREGA  Scheme  is 

being  re-packaged  to  benefit  farmers  as  48  thousand  crore  rupees  has  been 

provided  in the Budget  for  construction of  ten lakh ponds  under  the  schemes.   In 

addition to that coverage of Fasal Bima Yojana has been raised from 30 per cent to 

40  per  cent  for  the  financial  year  2017-18.    The  move  to  create  mini  soil  testing 

labs  in  Krishi  Vigyan  Kendra  in  the  country  will  definitely  encourage  farmers  to 

use  fertilizers  optimally.    However,  despite  the  steps  taken/to  be  taken  by  the 

government the condition of small and marginal farmers is still pitiable and there is 

a need to pay special attention to their condition.
