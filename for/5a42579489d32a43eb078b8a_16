  The  demerger  clause,  which  was  there  in  the 

Income Tax Act is now sought to be applicable to the Public Sector Undertakings 

also.    After  the  demerger  of  the  Public  Sector  Undertakings,  the  percentage  of 

Government  investment  comes  down  below  50,  then  all  Government  relaxations, 

reservations, concessions and facilities available to SCs, STs and OBCs will not be 

there  naturally.    My  doubt  is  that  will  the  demerger  of  the  Public  Sector 

Undertakings  also  lead  to  dereservation  for  the  employees  belonging  to  SCs  and 

STs of these companies?
