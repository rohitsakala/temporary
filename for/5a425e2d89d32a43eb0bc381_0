  This  Repealing 

and Amending Bill is one of the periodical measures by which enactments which 

have ceased to be enforced or have become obsolete or the retention whereof in the 

Statue  Book  has  become  unnecessary  are  repealed  and  removed  from  the  Statue 

Book.  The Union Government is committed to bring reforms in the legal system 

of  the  country  to  make  it  more  accessible  to the common  man.   In  this  direction, 

the  Prime  Minister's  Office  has  set  up  a  two-member  committee  on  1st  October, 

2014 for repeal of obsolete laws.  Various reports of the Law Commission and the 

report  of  the  two-member  Committee  were  taken  into  consideration  and  we 

identified  as  many  as  1,863  Acts  for  repeal.    The  present  Bill  is  for  repal  of  295 

Acts.  This being a periodical measure to clean the statue book, it is necessary that 

the repealing be done.  I, therefore, pray that the Bill be taken up for consideration 

and passing.
