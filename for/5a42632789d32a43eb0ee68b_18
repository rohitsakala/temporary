 I would like to know from the government as to what 

is the role of the private institutions which are involved in it.  What benefits will they 

get?  In what way we will be benefited by their participation.  So my request to the 

Central  Government  is  that  either  the  stake  of  the  Central  Government  should  be 

increase or the stake of the State Government be decreased.  In the recent scenario, 

thousands of IT  graduates are jobless.  An info park or a techno park should be set 

up  in  the  same  institution  in  which  they  study  so  that  they  can  be  given  the 

information of placement and training there.
