  Housing has always been  an indicator of 

standard  of  living.  Poverty  and  housing  has  a  strong  co-relation.  Rehabilitation  of 

slum  dwellers  is  a  major  challenge  in  urban  areas.  Poverty  reduction  should  be 

considered  as  an  important  national  task. The  Government  must  provide  minimum 

basic amenities in the slum areas. The Government to provide subsidized housing so 

that the people living on the pavements in cities can be brought under proper shelter. 

The  Government  direct  all  the  authorities  to  avoid  formation  of  new  slums  at  any 

cost.  The  urban  poverty  has  got  serious  implications  for  safety  and  security  of  the 

people of this country. The meet the challenges of urban poverty a number of policy 

approaches  are  needed.    I  request  this  Government  to  scale  up  the  livelihood 

promotion  programmes  in  a  time-bound manner to support  the  poor in building up 

their  own  assets.    I  request  this  Government  to  provide  assistance  to  the 

Rayalaseema region which is a backward region in Andhra Pradesh.
