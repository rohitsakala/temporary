  On  behalf  of  Telugu  Desam  Party,  we 

wholeheartedly support this Bill and congratulate the Minister for bringing forward 

a lot of historical Bills like the ones on Mental Healthcare etc.  Before AIDS there 

is  another  condition  which  is  called  HIV  positive.    Once  a  person  is  tested  HIV 

Positive,  for  him  to  develop  AIDS  it  may  take  10  years  to  20  years  and  in  some 

cases he may not even get AIDS.  Most of the patients of AIDS suffer from chronic 

malnutrition  and  under  nutrition.    Most  of  the  symptoms  and  signs  of  AIDS  just 

mimic tuberculosis.  A big debate is going on whether AIDS is a separate disorder 

as  district  from  tuberculosis  or  it  has  only  to  do  with  the  Sexually  Transmitted 

Diseases.    If  that  is  so,  let  us  call  it  Sexually  Transmitted  Diseases.  Why  do  we 

label it separately as AIDS and make the patients suffer from stigma.  I definitely 

support this Bill which has excellent provisions.
