  The  prosperity  of  farmers 

decides the prosperity of a nation.  In order to bring a change in the condition of 

farmers  various  schemes  like  Pradhan  Mantri  Fasal  Bima  Yojana  and  Pradhan 

Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana have been introduced.  All efforts have been made 

to  ensure  provision  of  Kisan  Credit  Cards,  affordable  loans,  cheaper  seeds  and 

fertilizers  alongwith  Soil  Health  Card  to  the  farmers.    An  E-National  Market  has 

been  put  in  place  for  the  farmers  so  that  they  may  get  better  prices  for  their 

produce.  Similarly,  the  government  has  been  working  on  doubling  the  income  of 

farmers  in  next  five  years  by  concentrating  on  the  overall  development  of 

agriculture sector.  In order to give a boost to agriculture sector, training is being 

provided to the farmers through agriculture Skill Development Centres.  Surajpur 

and  Balrampur  in  Sarguja  district  are  agriculture  dominated  areas.  So,  I  demand 

that an agriculture university should be opened in these areas.
