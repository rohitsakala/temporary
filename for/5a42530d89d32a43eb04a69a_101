  The  Government  of  India  has  taken  a 

number of very good steps for the welfare of farmers.  The Government has made 

a  provision  of  Rs.  Ten  lakh  crore  for  agriculture  loan.    Besides,  the  Government 

has  also  made  an  provision  of  around  48000  crore  rupees  under  MNREGA  to 

enhance rural employment.  However, there is a need to strengthen rural economy 

so as to make villages prosperous and to ease the problems of the farmers.
