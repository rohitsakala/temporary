  Statistics  are  very 

important. Therefore, its streamlining and strengthening are extremely essential for 

a  welfare  country  like  ours.    I  would  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  make 

computation more up-to-date.  This legislation is filling up a big vacuum in Jammu 

and  Kashmir  for  which  I  congratulate  the  hon.  Minister.  The  Nodal  Officer  is 

extremely essential both for the states as well as the Centre.  Therefore, that post 

should  be  made  compulsory  in  all  the  states.    The  sphere  of  statistics  may  be 

spread.    I  would  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  kindly  make  statistics  more 

comprehensive  so  that  the  welfare  schemes  could  be  better  implemented  and  the 

governance could also be improved as far as our country is concerned.  As far as 

unemployment  statistics  are  concerned,  we  need  to  collect  them  every  year. 

Similarly, for agriculture also, the frequency should be increased to every year so 

that whatever is to be done for the welfare of this sector, could be done in a better 

way. The gap between the rich and the poor is increasing.  Unless the statistics are 

provided adequately, the gap between the rich and the poor cannot be bridged.
