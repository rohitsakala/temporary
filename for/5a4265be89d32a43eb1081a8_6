 Today's Bill is consequential 

to the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to the States) Bill.  Our Party, our 

nation and this Parliament took a great leap of faith in our Government.  We hope 

that this will lead our country to a new era of tax-compliance.  We also have faith 

in  the  GST  Council.    Literally  the  Government  gave  lot  of  powers  to  the  GST 

Council.    But,  passing  the  Bill  is  one  thing,  implementation  is  yet  another  thing.  

Nevertheless,  we  wish  the  Government  well  to  implement  the  Bill  with  as  much 

zeal as it did with passing the Bill.
