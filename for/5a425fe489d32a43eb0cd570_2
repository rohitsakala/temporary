  I  rise  to  support  this  Bill.    Six  castes 

namely Aheria, Aheri, Hari, Heri, Thori, Turi of Haryana are being included in this 

Bill.  With regard to Kerala, Mannan, Pathiya, Meroyan, Peru, Vannan, Velnan etc. 

castes  have  also  been  proposed  to  be  included  in  this  Bill.    Similarly,  Ghasi, 

Ghasiya, Saes, Sarthi, Sut Sarthi, Thanwar castes are being included in the list of 

Odisha, West Bengal and particularly the Chhattisgarh state.  Our Government has 

made  an  endeavour  to  take  measures  for  the  upliftment  of  schedule  caste  and  for 

providing  stipend  to  the  meritorious  students  of  this  community.    Similarly,  a 

national  stipend  programme  for  the  students  studying  overseas  has  been 

introduced.    Again  a  entrepreneur  capital  fund  has  been  created  for  the 

entrepreneurs  of  scheduled  caste  community  and  200  crore  rupees  have  been 

earmarked for this purpose.  The government is setting up Ambedkar international 

Center  at  15,  Janpath.    In  current  budget, allocation  for  scheduled  caste  sub  plan 

has been increased by 11.99 which is almost 12 per cent.  Similarly, allocation for 

tribal sub plan has also been increased by approx. 14.50 per cent.  I would also like 

to request that reservation act should also be passed.
