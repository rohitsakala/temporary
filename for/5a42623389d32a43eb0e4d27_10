  This  Act  shall  act  as  a  deterrent  for  all 

those  employers  engaging  children  and  also  the  parents  who  force  their  own 

children  to  work  at  a  tender  age.    However,  allowing  children  below  14  years  of 

age  to  work  only  in  family  enterprises  may  dilute  the  very  spirit  of  the  Bill.    I 

request  the  Government to look  into  this  aspect.   It is  a  welcome  feature that  the 

offences  of  employing  children  in  contravention  of  the  law  have  been  made 

cognizable which would act as a deterrent.  The whole intention of the Government 

in  bringing  this  legislation  is  appreciated  but  much  more  has  to  be  done  for 

children.
