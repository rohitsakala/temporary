 We are among the 12 top countries in the world.  

We have only two per cent of the global trade share.  If we critically examine the 

history and achievement of bio-technological research in India, our achievement is 

almost negligible.  It is almost zero because there is no significant patent credited 

to  our  institutes.    There  are  a  lot  of  institutes.  But  those  institutes  are  only  for 

giving degrees.  What is their contribution in the field of bio-technology?  It is not 

a solution to give national importance to an institute.  It is better to strengthen all 

the  institutes  uniformly.    Most  of  the  time,  the  Central  Government  is  giving 

importance  to  North  India  or  South  India.    The  Eastern  part  of  India  is  being 

neglected  by  almost  all  the  Government.    My  submission  is  that  agriculturally 

sound State like West Bengal may be given due importance in the field of setting 

up biotechnology institutes.  Research should be fundamental and no Government 

interference  should  be  there.    But  Government  should  take  a  decision  whether 

biotechnologically  engineered  crops  or  genetically  modified  crops  are  not 

advisable  to  cater  to  the  needs  of  the  society  or  not.    Make  regulations,  make 

guidelines, but there should be certain limits.  Nanotechnology is equally important 

but that is not given due importance.  As biotechnology has a glorious past and a 

great future, it should be allowed to develop.  Simultaneously, there should be one 

nationally important nanotechnology research centre in India so that we can at least 

cater to the needs of the coming years of this country.
