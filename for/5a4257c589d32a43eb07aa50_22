  This  is  a very  important  which  is  concerned 

with  the  future  of  our  youth.    So  far  as  the  control  over  these  IIMs  is  concerned 

after giving autonomy, definitely there is a government body like the CAG which 

will  look  after  their  functioning.    The  biggest  advantage  of  this  Bill  is  that  it 

empowers these institutes  for providing degrees.   This  would certainly  give  them 

an identity at the international level.  I, therefore, support this Bill.
