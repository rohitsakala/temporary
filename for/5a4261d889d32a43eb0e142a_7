 It is evident that diseases relating to 

food habits, lifestyle and profession are continuously rising not only in India but in 

the whole world also.  Though, after the spread of education,  people have become 

more aware and cautious about their health.  But we are not as much aware about 

our mental health as we are in the case of our physical health.  Today, number of 

people  suffering  from  depression  is  rising  continuously  in  India  and  all  over  the 

world  which  is  a  matter  of  grave  concern.    There  is  a  need  to  create  awareness 

about this illness in the Indian society.  This Government is making endeavour to 

ensure  comprehensive  treatment  of  mental  patients  and  promotion  of  their  rights 

through  this  Bill.    In  this  Bill,  suicide  has  been  decriminalized.    Besides, 

permission  to  give  shock  treatment  to  mental  patients  can  be  granted  only  after 

administration of muscle relaxing treatment along with the anesthesia.  And these 

treatment  method  are  prohibited  in  case  of  minor  patients.    Through  this  Bill, 

efforts  would  be  made  to  provide  easy  and  affordable  medical  facilities  to  the 

mental patients.  In addition to that, a mental health review commission should be 

constituted which will be a quasi-judicial body.  Apart from that medical insurance 

cover should be provided to the mental patients on the same basis as is available 

for physical illness.
