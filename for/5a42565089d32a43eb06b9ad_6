  The  Juvenile  Justice  (Care  and  Protection  of 

Children)  Bill,  2014  has  been  introduced  by  the  hon.  Minister  to  replace  the  Act 

passed in this House in the year 2000. The crux of the Bill is with regard to the trial 

of  juveniles  as  adults, we  have to discuss and  debate on, in detail.   About 80 per 

cent  of  the  juvenile  offenders  come  from  desperately  poor  and  deprived  socio-

economic  backgrounds.    It  is  their  harsh  upbringing  that  is  primarily  responsible 

for them turning to crime.  There are a few Clauses, which are good. For example, 

the constitution of the Juvenile Justice Board, earlier the conducting of inquiry was 

not  specified  clearly  whereas  in  this  Bill  it  is  very  clear.    With  regard  to  Child 

Welfare  Committees  also  the  hon.  Minister  had  taken  good  steps  to  for  the 

functioning  of  these  committees.    It    is  good  that  these  Special  Juvenile  Police 

Units and Child Welfare Police Officers are constituted.  But I do not know how 

budget is going to be allocated because law and order is a State subject.  I do not 

know  whether  this  Union  Government  will  support  the  states  to  have  this 

functioning  in  each  police  station.    With  regard  to  adoption  also,  the  provision 

made in this Bill is laudable. I would request the hon. Minister to consider deleting 

this provision  which is there  in  Clauses 7,16, 19(3)  and  20 of  this  Bill  wherein a 

juvenile, who is aged between 16 and 18 years, if he commits some heinous crime, 

is  to  be  tried  as  an  adult.    I  think  this  is  not  a  good  provision  in  the  present 

circumstances.    I  would  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  see  that  this  clause  is 

withdrawn.
