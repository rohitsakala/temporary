  The  entire  country  was  very  happy 

when  the  hon.  Finance  Minister  announced  six  IITs  in  the  budget  for  the  year 

2015.  Today's economy is technology driven economy.  The more we develop the 

technology,  the  more  we  will  develop.    Technology  brings  qualitative  change  in 

life.  Our country has 2 per cent land and 17 per cent population of the world.  If 

we want to turn this population into resource, we will have to pursue technology.  

If  we  want  to  compete  with  the  world  community,  we  need  to  have  competitive 

technology  in  every  field.    Space  market  is  worth  14  lakh  crore  and  American 

share is 41 per cent whereas our share is only 4 per cent. If we grow in the field of 

technology, our share in space market will also increase.  We will have to explore 

alternative  sources  of  energy.    Approximately  25,000  IITians  have  gone  to 

America  since  1953.    Had  these  25,000  IITians  served  our  country,  they  would 

have helped the country develop somewhat more.  When we spend so much on our 

IITians then we should put a condition that they should serve in the country for a 

certain period instead of directly going to foreign country.
