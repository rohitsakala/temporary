 Private adoption clause should be inserted 

in  the  Hindu  Adoption  Act.  Condition  of  court  order  should  be  made  mandatory 

for such adoption.  In respect of late marriage and financial stability, the age limit 

should  be  extended  from  16  to  18  years.    The  age  of  adoptive  parent  should  be 

extended  to  50  years  for  male  and  40  years  for  female.    In  matrimonial  cases,  if 

custody is given to mother, she shall get the right of father as well as of mother.  If 

full custody is given to the mother, only she should have right on her child and in 

that case, father's right should be waived.  In that case, the mother has to be given 

adoption  right.    All  the  official  authorities  should  be  given  the  direction  to  allow 

the change of name of a child as per his own choice and wish.  Or, the custodian 

parents  can  give  their  names  to  his  child.    For  that,  no  court  order  is  required  or 

there is no need of any consent of his or her original father or mother.  The Hindu 

law  or the  Hindu  Adoption  Act should  be  reformed  accordingly.   Every  payment 

made  to  an  orphan  house  for  adoption  should  be  made  by  cheque  and  not  in  the 

form  of  cash.   An  online  form  for  adoption  is  mandatory.    The  Indian  council  of 

Social  Welfare  Committee  is  to  be  established  in  every  district  of  the  country.  

After a court's order, there should be no need for registration of an Adoption deed.  

The  matter  relating  to  adoption  in  the  court  should  be  disposed  of  within  one 

month.
