 It is nearly 70 years since the country 

has  got  its  freedom  but  it  is  a  matter  of  regret  that  even  after  so  many  years  the 

policy of reservation has had little impact on the lives of the Scheduled Castes and 

the Scheduled Tribes people.  These socially deprived people live a precarious life 

unable  to  still  fulfill  the  bare  necessities  of  life.    The  age-old  caste  system  is  the 

main cause of the social inequalities in our country.  Although our Constitution has 

provisions  for  reservation  for  these  socially  deprived  people,  they  have  benefited 

from these reservations only in a limited way.  We need to put effort to make these 

people  become  a  part  of  the  mainstream  society.    It  is  also  evident  that  with 

inclusion of more castes under the Scheduled Caste category, the government will 

require  more  funds to  make  sure that  every  such  member  is  enabled to  access  all 

opportunities  and  facilities.    So,  I  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  revise  the  fund 

allocation towards the welfare of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe people.  

The  time  has  come  to  provide  quality  education  to  our  children  from  the  nursery 

level as only through education our children can make a good future.
