  In  a  week  time  the  election  process  will 

start  in  Bengal.    This  amply  manifest  as  to  how  this  government  is  functioning.  

The Government should have got this Bill passed in the House in December itself.  

Today, those who are in Union Government and those in the Government of West 

Bengal  opposed  this  Bill  for  political  reasons.      After  this  legislation  the  people 

will  get  the  right  to  vote  but  they  should  get  all  necessary  civic  amenities  also.  

This needs to be looked into. 

 

SHRI  GEORGE  BAKER: I would like to ask the hon. Law Minister that 

when Andhra Pradesh was a united State, there was one Anglo-Indian MLA.  That 

Anglo-Indian  MLA  has  now  been  transferred  over  to  Telangana.    Is  there  any 

provision  since  there  are  seats  being  increased,  an  Anglo-Indian  can  get 

representation from Andhra Pradesh.
