  I  on  behalf of my  Party, the  Sikkim  Democratic 

Front Party supports this Bill fully.  I would like to congratulate the hon. Minister 

and  the  NDA  Government  for  bringing  in  this  historic  Bill.    20  IIMs  are  being 

granted  the  importance  as  institutions  of  national  importance  by  virtue  of  their 

brand association.  This Bill will be the harbinger for the next generation of IIMs 

and  IITs  that  will  be  built.    I  would  like  to  just  say  that  in  the  case  of  IIM 

Ahmedabad,  there  has  been  a  lot  of  concern  expressed  today  regarding  how 

teaching  can be  made  of  service  the  rural  people.   There  are  several  examples  of 

people  coming  out  of  IIMs  and  started  giving  back  through  building  of  angel 

funds.    I  would  also  like  to  refer  to  the  Jawaja  Experiment  of  Ravi  J.  Matthai, 

which was carried out in a remote part of Rajasthan led to formation of the Institute 

of  Rural  Management  at  Anand.    We  assure  you  that  through  collaboration  and 

research, we will take brand IIM to the rest of the world and indeed to the rest of 

India as well.
