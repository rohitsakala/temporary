  The  amendment  in  the  Bill  is  to 

strengthen the data collection mechanism in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  The 

amendment  is  intended  to  address  the  legislative  vacuum  which  will  help  the 

social upliftment of the people residing in Jammu and Kashmir.  But it should be 

taken  care  of  that  after  the  implementation  of this legislation, there  should be no 

conflict  with  the  setup  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  in  collection  of  data  and  input  of 

statistics.    I,  on  behalf  of  my  Party,  welcome  the  Bill,  I  suggest  to  incorporate  a 

provision  into  the  proposed  Bill  that  there  should  be  a  timeframe  for  furnishing 

data and it has to be made binding on all because the current status of statistics of 

some  departments  with  regard  to  adequacy,  timelines  and  reliability  are  far  from 

satisfactory.  Timely availability of statistics is the essence of the efficiency of the 

National  Statistical  System.    Statistics  with  a  long  time  gap  may  not  be  of  much 

use for policy-making.
