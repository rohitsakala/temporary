 The whole nation is concerned on 

the issue of housing and poverty alleviation because urban housing shortage in India 

is  estimated  to  be  18.78  million  during  the  12th  Plan.    Therefore,  it  is  high  time  to 

review  the  existing  schemes,  their  bottlenecks  and  inadequacies.    Moreover,  it  is 

estimated  that  35  per  cent  of  urban  population  is  under  the  grip  of  acute  poverty.  

Housing  for  all  is  our  primary  goal.    There  should  be  a  close  coordination  among 

various  Ministries  such  as  Environment, Health, Education, Social Justice, Women 

and Child Development.
