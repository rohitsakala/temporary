 This is a very important bill 

providing  for  quick  resolution  to  management  of  assets  funded  by  banks  and 

financial  institutions  and  which  have,  for  whatever  reasons,  become  sick  or 

underperforming.  As per the latest available data, as on September 2015 , 6.2 per 

cent of the total loans of public sector banks have been categorized as bad loans or 

non-performing assets.  To keep a check on Asset Reconstruction Companies, RBI 

has  been  empowered  to  penalize  erring  institutions.    The  changes  will  empower 

district  magistrates to  help  banks take over  the  management  of  a  company, if  the  

entity is unable to repay loans.  The Bill also seeks to create a central database to 

integrate  the  records  of  property  registered  with  the  promoters  anywhere  in  the 

country.    While  we  need  such  Bills  in  the  larger  interest  of  quicker  resolution  of 

bad debts, what is more important is what we will do with these acquired assets.  I 

want  to  raise  a  fundamental  question  here  in  this  House.    What  is  the  use  of 

legislation  and  promises  which  we  are  making  here,  if  we  do  not  adhere  to  it?  

Even now, I would like to request and make an appeal to the hon. Prime Minister 

and  the  hon.  Finance  Minister  to  adhere  to  the  promises  that  were  made  with 

regard to Andhra Pradesh.
