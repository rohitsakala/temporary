 Rich walk to digest food and poor walk to earn 

their  livelihood.    This  is  the  level  of  disparity  prevailing  in  our  country.    UNDP 

says  that  the  number  of  poor  is  increasing  along  with  increase  in  the  number  of 

millionaires.    About  80  percent  population  of  the  country  is  sustaining  on  the 

income of one dollar per day.  But, I am in support of this Bill.  I would like to say 

that it should be a balanced one.  If the workers are given due share of their labour 

and quality then there would be no need at all to give them any bonus.
