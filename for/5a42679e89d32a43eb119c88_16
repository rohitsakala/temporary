  I am extremely  grateful to you for allowing me to 

speak on the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Amendment) 

Bill, 2017.  The Bill proposes to increase authroised capital of NABARD from Rs. 

5,000  crore  to  Rs.  30,000  crore.    Such  move  reflects  the  conviction  and 

commitment of the Government towards villages and agriculture sector. One of the 

major  problems  being  faced  by  farmers  today  is  related  to  market.  If  we  provide 

storage  facility  to  farmers  for  their  perishable  and  non-perishable  produces  at 

Panchayat  level  through  NABARD,  then  major  problems  of  farmers  would  be 

solved.  NABARD has made great contribution in the field of irrigation. NABARD 

has played a major role in setting up of check dam and barrage. While supporting 

the Bill, I would say that special attention needs to be paid towards its monitoring 

and assets creation.
