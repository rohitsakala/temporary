  The  Union  Govt.  has  announced  a 

Scheme  'Housing  for  All'-  A  Scheme  for  low-income  housing.    The  Central  Govt. 

has  almost  completed  2  years  in  Office  and  still  their  announcements  during 

Elections  are  yet  to  be  implemented  and  benefit  the  people.    Under  this  Scheme 

Housing  for  All-  Bengal  under  the  Leadership  of  Hon'ble  Chief  Minister  Mamata 

Banerjee showed the way to all.  In her regime, Mamta ji has achieved quite a lot in 

terms  of  building  houses  for  EWS,  LIG  and  MIG.  In  EWS  Scheme  there  are  two 

categories  'Gitanjali' &  'Amar  Thikana'  by  which  construction  of  rural  housing  has 

been  much  better  benefiting  the  Rural  Poor.    In  this  context,  I  request  the  Union 

Govt.  to  implement  the  Welfare  Schemes  announced,  equally  without  partiality  in 

the betterment of the Nation.
