 There is a need to monitor the social and 

economic status of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to ensure education to 

them.    Without  the  collaboration  of  the  deprived  society,  overall  development  in 

the  country  cannot  be  dreamt  of.    Various  state  governments  have  requested  for 

inclusion  of  some  castes  of  their  states  in  the  list  of  scheduled  castes.    In  my 

opinion,  only  those  castes  should  be  included  in  the  list,  which  are  close  to  the 

scheduled castes.  In my Parliamentary constituency, girls of the scheduled castes 

category come to the urban areas from rural areas for college education, where no 

arrangement  for  their  residence  at  the  district  level  remains  available.    As  such, 

they  have  to  leave  their  studies.    It  is  my  request  that  hostels  be  constructed  at 

district  level  for  such  girls  where  these  girls  could  stay  to  complete  their  college 

education.  Besides, in my parliamentary constituency of Janjgir-Champa, there is 

no hostel for the students of the scheduled caste category.  I demand for that also.  

Leave  may  be  declared  at  the  central  level  on  18th  December  on  the  birthday  of 

Guru  Ghasidas  Babaji.    In  the  serial  number  14  of  the  Scheduled  Castes  List  of 

Chhattisgarh,  Satnami,  Ramnami  and  Suryavanshi  may  be  allotted  separate  serial 

numbers.
