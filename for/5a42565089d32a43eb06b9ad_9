  Overall,  this  Bill  is  very  positive.    But 

where I stand in my dilemma is whether 16 is good or 18 is good.  So, I would like 

the Minister to explain this because there are critics of this Bill also who have over 

a  period  of  time  worked  with  children, who  have  reservations on  making  18  into 

16.  One Nirbhaya case is the reason why we are doing this.  Laws cannot be made 

by  emotions.    There  is  another  aspect  where  Article  15  of  the  Constitution  talks 

about protecting all our children.  But from 16 years to 18 years is a very small and 

very tender gap.  This is a very serious Bill which is going to have a social impact 

for  a  lot  of  people  for  generations  to  come.    If  the  Minister  could  kindly  clarify 

what is the roadmap for the future we would definitely like to hear from here.  The 

'places  of  safety'  is  something  that  we  really  need  to  look  into.    Basic  abuse  of 

children and young boys starts in these shelters in a lot of cases. I would like the 

hon. Minister to  make sure that every child is protected  making sure that there is 

no  conflict  of  this  Bill  with  the  Constitution;    This  Bill  is  about  psychology, 

sociology  and  legal  aspect.    Every  child  is  an  asset  to  this  country.    I  hope  that 

whatever choice we make for them is the right decision.
