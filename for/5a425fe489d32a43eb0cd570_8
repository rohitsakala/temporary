    The  rights  of  the  poor  people  are  being  trampled 

upon.    We  all  know  that  one  million  vacancies  are  yet  to  be  filled  up  in  various 

Government Departments and Public Sector Undertakings.  If the founding fathers 

of the Constitution did not have that much of vision we can say that in this House 

so many SC and ST members would not be there.  Thousands of people are denied 

the fruits of reservation just because a slight variation in pronunciation of the caste 

they  belong  to.      In  this  year's  budget  also  SC  sub-plan  and  ST  sub-plan  in  real 

terms has come down.  It is high time that Justice Ranganath Commission Report 

should  be  implemented.    It  is  a  matter  of  social  justice  as  enshrined  by  the 

Constitution of India.
