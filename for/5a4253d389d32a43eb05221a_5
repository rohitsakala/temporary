  Introduction  of  the  Admiralty  in 

Jurisdiction  and  Settlement  of  Martime  Claims  Bill  2016  in  the  House  is  the 

timeliest for the fulfillment of India's aspirations of being the leader of the Indian 

Ocean.    This  Bill  seeks  to  consolidate  all  the  existing  laws  on  civil  matters  of 

admiralty,  jurisdiction  of  courts,  admiralty  proceedings  of  maritime  claims  and 

arrest  of  ships.    In  recent  days,  we  have  witnessed  many  naval  accidents  causing 

immense  pollution  in  our  coastal  waters  like  that  of  the  recent  accident  near 

Kamaraj  Port,  Chennai.    As  yet,  there  is  immense  delay  in  adjudicating  such 

navigation issues due to lack of clarity in rules.  I hope this Bill would sort out all 

the issues pertaining to navigation and pave way for reaching our potential in high 

seas.    I  would  like  to  emphasis  on  infrastructure  development  in  Kakinada  for 

better multimodal connectivity to the port.  I also request the Government for the 

establishment  of  a  Maritime  Educational  Institution  in  the  State  on  the  lines  of 

Chennai  for  encouragement  of  the  youth  towards  new  areas  of  career  as  well  as 

employment  generation  in  the  State.  I  further  request  the  Government  for  the 

establishment  of  Oceanographic  Museum  in  Kakinada  to  increase  awareness  of 

Oceanographic Studies, maritime assets and resources among the public.  More so, 

it also increases the tourist potential of the State.
