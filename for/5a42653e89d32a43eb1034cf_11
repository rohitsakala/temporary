  A  simplified  taxation  system  would  be 

implemented  in  the  country  with  the  implementation  of  GST  which  would  be 

transparent, will help in growth of the GDP and promote the economic growth rate 

of the country. Most of the apprehensions are regarding the share of the states. This 

Bill  should  have  come  by  2010.  There  was  a  trust  deficit  between  the  Union 

Government and the state governments. This government has tried to eliminate this 

trust deficit.  The provisions in the Bill do not leave any room for apprehensions on 

the part of the state governments. The present system of taxation has given rise to 

trust  deficit  between  the  general  public  and  the  Union  Government  as  well.  The 

complexity  of  the    taxation  procedure  has  led  to  the  saying,  'tax  is  terror'.  GST 

would  give  relief  from  this  terror.  The  trust  deficit  would  be  filled  up.  People 

would  become  participants,  pay  taxes  of  their  own  volition,  the  tax  net  would 

become wider and the taxation rates would also rise. Discussion has been held on 

demand  for  grants  for  six  Ministries.  Most  of  the  hon.  Members  supported  the 

demand for increase in grants during the discussion regarding each  Ministry. The 

new GST law would prove useful from this point of view.
