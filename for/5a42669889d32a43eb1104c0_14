  The  Bill  provides  for  payment  of 

bonus to persons employed in certain establishments on the basis of profits or on 

the basis of production or productivity.   There should be no upper limit of salary 

for getting bonus.  Everybody working in various sectors should get bonus.  I have 

a  suggestion  to  the  Minister  that  there  should  be  provision  of  giving  bonus  in 

advance  for  the  employees  who have  some  emergency  in  their  families.   At  least 

50 per cent of the bonus should be given to them in the case of an emergency.
