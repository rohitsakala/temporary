 I fully support the Finance Bill on behalf 

of my Party.  I would like to thank the Government for integration of the Railway 

Budget  with  the  General  Budget  as  it  is  a  big  step  towards  harmonizing  the  rail 

network  with  roads,  air  and  water  transport.    The  State  Government  of  Andhra 

Pradesh  thankful  to  the  Centre  for  fulfilling  its  commitments  under  Andhra 

Pradesh  Reorganization  Act  2014  and  for  supporting  the  development  oriented 

vision  of  the  hon.  Chief  Minister  of  Andhra  Pradesh.    The  formation  of  a  new 

Railway Zone becomes crucial because the headquarters of the South Central Zone 

Railway  is  at  Secunderabad  which  is  now  in  the  state  of  Telangana  and  there  is 

urgent  need  for  a  separate  Railway  Zone  for  Andhra  Pradesh  at  Visakhapatnam.  

Moreover,  the  Central  Government  is  requested  to  remove  the  restraints  of  first-

time sale, and provide exemption from capital gains tax for legal heirs who receive 

the  land  as  inheritance.    I  would  like  to  know  the  progress  of  Hardware  Park 

project at Kakinada announced by our hon. Finance Minister in his Budget 2014-

15 which people of my Constituency Kakinada are eagerly awaiting.  At the same 

time,  the  Central  Government  is  requested  to  provide  clarifications  regarding 

allocations for NIPER as the 2017-18 Budget shows a combined allocation of Rs. 

127.73  crore  for  all  NIPERS,  the  seven  existing  ones  and  four  proposed  ones.  

Finally,  I  would  request  the  Government  of  India  to  enhance  the  MPLADS  from 

Rs. 5 crore to at least Rs. 15 crore per year.
