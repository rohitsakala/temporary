  This  amendment  Bill  is  very  important 

considering  the  grim  situation  of  the  banking  sector  in  the  country  today.    The 

higher  rate  of  NPAs  has  weakened  the  profitability  and  liquidity  position  of  the 

banks, necessitating the recent recapitalization of public sector banks to the tune of 

Rs.22,915 crore.  The Reserve Bank of India has taken some measures for recovery 

of  bad  loans,  like  restructuring  bad  debts,  boosting  the  Asset  Reconstruction 

Companies  etc.    But  these  measures  have  not  served  their  intended  purposes.    I 

hope the present Bill will help in expeditious recovery of bad loans and strengthen 

the ailing public sector banks and financial institutions in the country.
