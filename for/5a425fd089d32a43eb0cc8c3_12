 I rise to speak in support of this 

Bill.    People  of  the  country  wanted  such  a  Bill  for  a  long  time.    In  the  previous 

years the real estate builders plundered the people, the farmers, householders and 

ditched  everyone.    Money  was  collected  from  a  large  number  of  people  on  the 

promise  to  deliver  homes  to  them.    There  are  even  such  builders  who  sold  lands 

meant  for  roads,  even  sold  green  parks.    A  commission  should  be  set  up  to 

determine where the money earned through such practices has been deposited.  The 

Clause to deposit 70 per cent of the amount in the banks, in my view, would check 

black money.   Lastly, I thanked my Government for bringing an important Bill.
