  Agriculture  is  not  a  profitable 

business now.  So, people from agriculture sector are migrating to other sector.  So, 

the  government  should  take  initiative  to  boost  the  agriculture  sector.    Farmers 

should get profitable price of their crops instead of just MSP.  There is a need to 

allocate  more  fund  to  Krishi  Sinchayee  Yojana.    Most  of  our  famers  are  not 

familiar  with  the  updated  scientific  methods  of  farming.    Government  can  easily 

solve  this  problem  by  strengthening  our  K.V.Ks.    An  effective  policy  and 

providing sufficient fund for encouraging organic farming is the urgent need of the 

time.  The need is to provide more subsidy for organic manure.
