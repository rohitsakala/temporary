  Even  after  68  years  of  Independence  people 

living in urban areas have no housing facilities. There are crores of people without 

housing  facilities  in  cities.  Our  Prime  Minister  Shri  Narendra  Modi  has  decided  to 

provide  housing  facilities,  alongwith  water,  electricity  and  toilet  facilities  to  the 

urban  poor.  In  the  year,  2022,  when  the  country  would  be  celebrating  75th  year  of 

Independence,  there  will  be  housing  facility  available  to  one  and  all.  Our 

Government  has  approved  the  construction  of  6,83,724  housing  units  on  18th  

November, 2015. A budget of Rs. 10050 crore has been approved for this. Housing 

units in cities will be alotted for females. In last 2 years 400541 persons have been 

trained  under  skill  development  programme.  Our  Government  have  helped  in 

forming  1,00,431,  Self-Help  Group  out  of  which  89752  SHG  have  been  provided
