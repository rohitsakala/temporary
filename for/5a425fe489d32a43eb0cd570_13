  I  intend  to  speak  in  the  favour  of  the 

amendment  Bill.    Time  since  when  the  NDA  Government  has  been  constituted 

under the leadership of hon. Prime Minister, hardly any month has passed by when 

some steps have not been taken for the dalits in a period of last one year and nine 

months.  Ever since hon. Prime Minister has stated that the poor have got the first 

right  on  the  resources  of  the  country,  such  people  are  at  pains  who  always  talk 

about the rights of a particular section of a society.  Steps are being taken to solve 

the issues confronting the SCs and STs one after another.
