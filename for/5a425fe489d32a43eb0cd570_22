  I  support 

the  Constitution 

(Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2016.  There are several castes which 

are  included  in  the  scheduled  castes  list  in  a  city  and  in  another  city  they  are  in 

OBC list.  In my constituency in Bundelkhand large number of Basor castes have 

come and settled.  Here they are not dalits but they are extremely backward even 

among  the  Scheduled  Castes.    I  request  that  they  be  included.    There  are  dhobis 

living  in  Bhopal  included  in  the  Scheduled  Castes  list.    However,  10  km  away 

from  Bhopal  they  are  in  the  OBC  list.    Such  classification  should  be  based  on 

scientific  basis.    The  National  Commission  for  OBCs  should  be  accorded 

constitutional status.
