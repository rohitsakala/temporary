  I  would  like  to  place  on  record 

certain factual things so far as the Ministry of External Affairs is concerned.  It is 

time for sincere appreciation for the hon. Minister of External Affairs for handling 

various  issues  concerning  the  Ministry  of  External  Affairs.    I  would  also  like  to 

place  on  record  that  the  hon.  Prime  Minister  saw  that  the  Agreement,  which  was 

signed  between  the  two  Heads  of  the  States  need  to  be  respected  and  honoured. 

This  will    definitely  send  a  very  positive  signal  not  only  to  the  people  of  our 

country but also the people of world at large.  The Bill is going to serve a lot in the 

national interest.  Let me come to some of the critical observation which we must 

be extremely cautious about it.  The first issue is the security issue.  I am a victim 

in  my  constituency  because  of  certain  illegal  immigrants  by  Bangladeshi.    This 

needs to be taken into account.  Unless we look at the security issue, we may be a 

victim tomorrow.  I urge the hon. Minister to look into it.  Another important factor 

which I would like to urge upon is the very bonafideness of the Bangladesh people 

who will take citizenship of India.  It is extremely possible that there will be a lot 

of claimants who are not bonafide.  So, we have to have checks and balance in the 

system  to  ensure  that  the  bonafideness  of  the  people  of  Bangladesh  so  that  India 

does  not  face  problems  tomorrow.  We  have  to  prepare  a  blue  print  for  a  time-

bound development of all the enclaves which come to our fold.
