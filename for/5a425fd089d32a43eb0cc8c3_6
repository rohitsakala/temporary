 It is a much needed bill considering 

the fact that though the real estate sector is one of the most important sectors of our 

economy and though it provides direct and indirect employment to cores of people, 

yet it also remains one of the most unorganized sectors. The most important step in 

this  Bill  is  that  the  developer  will have  to  put 70 per  cent  of the  money  received 

from  the  customers  for  a  new  project  in  a  separate  'escrow'  account  so  that  the 

funds are not directed to start a new project.  This is a huge step to ensure that the 

construction is completed within the stipulated time.  There are many provisions in 

the Bill which give comfort to the buyers against delay and fraud.  The Bill states 

that the registration with the regulatory authority is required only for those projects 

where land is more than 500 square metres or if the number of units is more than 

eight.    I  fail  to  understand  the  rationale  behind  this  ceiling.    The  Bill  states  that 

registration is not necessary for redevelopment projects.  So, is this law applicable 

to such projects or not?  Although the Bill focuses on developer's accountability, it 

should have also brought the civic and other related bodies that are responsible for 

permission  under  its  ambit.    The  Bill  has  put  the  onus  of  the  conveyance  deed 

entirely on the promoter or the developer of the project and the buyers have no say 

in  the  matter.    Ideally  there  should  be  a  provision  for  the  deemed  conveyance  to 

protect  the  interest  of  the  home  buyers  with  respect  to  the  title.    I  hope  some  of 

these concerns will be addressed satisfactorily.
