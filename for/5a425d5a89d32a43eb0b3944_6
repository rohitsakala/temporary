    With  respect  to  this  Bill,  personally,  I  am  not 

against any emoluments being given to the judges.  Those who do service should 

be given necessary remuneration, salary, allowance, pension, etc.  I would like to 

ask hon. Law  Minister  as to  what happened  to  NJAC.   They  struck down  an  Act 

which has become the will of the people.  The people of the country were taken for 

a ride.  There is a need to make the Judiciary accountable.
