 

I  support 

the  NABARD 

(Amendment)  Bill,  2017.    The  capital  of  NABARD    has  been  increased  to  Rs 

30,000 crore from Rs 5000 crore.  In this Bill,  arrangement has also  been made  

for  increasing  this  capital,  if  necessary,    in  the  future.  Today,  the  condition  of 

banks  in  our  country  is  not  good.    The  banks  are  not  ready  to  finance  the  poor 

people and the farmers.  I would like to tell the Government that in our country the 

banking network is very poor.  Either there is not even a single bank or only one   

bank for a population of 25,000 people.  Regional Rural Banks are  not serving any 

purpose. The Cooperative banks are successful  only in  few states.  The branches 

of nationalised banks  should be expanded  and it should be made mandatory that 

wherever  there  are  agricultural  produce  market  ,    atleast  one  nationalised  bank 

should  be  set  up  there  so  that      it  would  be  beneficial  for  the  farmers.    The  

NABARD can do a lot of work in Bundelkhand, which is considered as the most 

backward  State,  however,    it  would  be  possible  only  when  the  banks  cooperate  

NABARD    in  this  regard.    There  is  more  scope  for  dairy  sector  in  Bundelkhand.  

Arrangement  should  be  made  for  providing  smart  card,    the  number  of  banks 

should be increased and along with this, it should be made mandatory for the banks 

to   provide finance facility to the poor.  Assistance of NABARD can be taken for 

minor irrigation.
