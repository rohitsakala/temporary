  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the 

Government  for  its  decision  to  setup  IITs  and  an  IIT  related  to  mines.    It  would 

definitely  benefit  the  country.    Every  area,  from  part  of  the  country  to  other,  has 

been kept in view that Government has decided that every state there should be a 

school of higher learning.  I belong to Uttar Pradesh which is quite a big state.  I 

would  like  to  demand  that  at  least  four  IITs  be  setup  in  such  a  big  state  as  Uttar 

Pradesh  in  the  next  Budget.    Backward  areas  need  to  be  given  importance.    For 

example, Bundelkhand area is quite backward in terms of education.  There is three 

per cent reservation for the students of the backward areas in the NIIT.  I wish to 

demand the hon. Minister that quota be fixed for the students of the backward areas 

in IT and IITs on the lines of the NIITs.  Fee structures  are proposed to be raised 

under  which  it  is  to  be  raised  Rs.  3  lakh  from  Rs.  90  thousand.    This  fee  is  too 

much  for  the  students  of  the  backward  areas.    It  is  my  request  that  it  should  be 

reconsidered.  It is my suggestion that the subject of rural technology may also be 

introduced.  It is my demand to the hon. Minister that the students of the backward 

areas be given more than four chances to appear in the examination.  I suggest that 

facility  of  coaching  be  provided  for the  students  of the  poor  areas  in  government 

engineering  colleges.    It  would  be  beneficial  for  the  students  if  the  staff  of  the 

government  engineering  colleges  provide  coaching  to  them  for  an  hour.    The 

Government should consider it.
