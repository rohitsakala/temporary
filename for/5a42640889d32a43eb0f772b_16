  The  demand  for 

granting  constitutional  status  to  the  National  Commission  for  Backward  Classes 

has been raised for the last 25 years.  However, it is really unfortunate that despite 

so  many  successive  governments  coming  to  power  during  this  period  no  one 

showed  any  promptness  in  finding  out  a  permanent  solution  to  the  problem  of 

backward classes of the country.  This government has paid heed and understood 

the  pain  of  backward  classes  and  it  is  by  taking  cognizance  of  this  long  pending 

demand the government has taken this step of providing the constitutional status to 

the  National  Commission  for  Backward  Classes.    The  entire  House  should 

cooperate in passing this Bill because this is an historical act which will go a long 

way in shaping the destiny of these backward classes in India.  In response to the 

issue of usurping the rights of the states is concerned.  I would like to say that this 

change  being  brought  by  our  government  is  targeted  at  making  the  Parliament 

supreme.    The  steps  being  taken  by  our  government  are  meant  to  bring  more 

transparency.    Better  decisions  in  the  interest  of  the  country  will  be  taken  on  the 

platform of this august House.  The inclusion or exclusion of any caste will not be 

dependent on the whim and fancies of an individual, rather such decisions would 

be taken on the basis of objective data and scrutiny of the Parliament.  I would also 

like to request the government that the demands of OBC community related to the 

subjects  like  setting  up  of  a  separate  ministry  for  OBCs,  raising  the  ceiling  of 

creamy  layer,  releasing  the  data  of  caste  census  and  ensuring  the  participation  of 

OBCs from the President's Secretariat to Judiciary should be met.
