 I want to talk in a constructive criticism 

manner.   Urbanisation  is  increasingly  becoming  a  serious  problem  that  has  not  got 

enough attention.  I compliment the Minister and his Government because they have 

been announcing good projects for all of these schemes, particularly bandwidth and 

bijli.  During the JNNURM period of ten years, nine lakh urban houses were built.  

But,  this  Government  has  announced  a  target  of  building  two  crore  houses  by  the 

year  2022.    I  commend  this  high  target  but  I  have  some  things  to  say  about  it.  

Unless  we  can  tackle  urban  poverty  and  unless  we  can  tackle  urbanisation,  we 

cannot improve India.  India is already 50 per cent urban.  Urbanisation is about the 

basic requirement of hosing for every Indian.   But a lot of these houses being built 

are  lying  vacant.    In  Gujarat,  out  of  1,18,000  odd  houses  built,  29,126  were  lying 

vacant.  I urge the hon. Minister that a body must be set up to ensure and co-ordinate 

with the State and municipal authorities that wherever these houses are built for the 

urban  poor  proper  co-ordination  must  be  there  so  that  they  are  filled  up.    Another 

point  is  the  mis-alignment  of  utilization  of  funds  and  allocation  of  funds.    Where 

there  has  been  very  good  utilization  of  money  it  has  not  been  followed  up  with 

equally good allocation for the next year.  However, in the case of Odisha, there is 

better utilisation so they should be allocated more funds.
