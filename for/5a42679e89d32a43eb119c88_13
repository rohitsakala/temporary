  The Bill pertaining to NABARD and 

rural  development  is  a  landmark  Bill  that  will  improve  the  condition  of  our 

agriculturists and other. The small farmers will gain out of it. Employment needs to 

be generated. The private commercial banks are opening up branches everywhere. 

So,  the  need  to  the  hour  is  to  open  more  branches  of  Rural  Development 

Cooperative Banks at the sub-divisional level. It will give a boost to the generation 

of employment in the villages. The youths of weaker and marginalized sections of 

societies like SCs and STs will also gain out of it. Agriculture has become a non-

remunerative profession. There is an acute shortage of proper storage facilities for 

foodgrains.  Pershable  goods  need  proper  refrigeration  facilities.  The  poor  and 

helpless  farmers  cannot  fulfil  all  the  conditions  put  forward  by  the  banks  for 

granting loans. So, norms must be relaxed.
