  I  wish  to  congratulate  the  hon.  Minister  for 

bringing this piece of legislation to curb the unfair trade practices in the real estate 

scenario.    This  is  the  need  of  the  hour  too.    The  objective  of  this  Bill  to  is  to 

regulate  and  develop  the  real  estate  in  our  country.    If  we  can  bring  down  this 

exclusion  area  to  100  square  metres  build  up  area  we  can  bring  more  people 

because the less privileged and the small buyers can be brought under the ambit of 

this Bill and thereby we can protect their interests also.  The 'net usable area' is not 

defined and much clarity is to be brought in.  As regard the period of rectification 

of the structural defects it should be increased to five years.
