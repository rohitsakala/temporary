  I  rise 

to  support 

the  Atomic  Energy 

(Amendment)  Bill,  2015.    This  Bill  is  a  step  towards  India  realizing  its  aim  of 

attaining the title of the  'vishwa guru'.   My  first  question  is that  as to  why  do  we 

give  the  least  priority  to  the  education  and  research.    We  should  pay  attention 

towards giving top priority to moral education and research in India. I would urge 

that maximum spending should take place on the research centers and priority be 

given to the moral education.
