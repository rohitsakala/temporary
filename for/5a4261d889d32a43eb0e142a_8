 A large number of people suffer from 

stress-related  mental  illness  like  depression  etc.    When  educated  young  people 

don't get jobs and unemployment increases by leaps and bounds, there is a spurt in 

mental  diseases  in  the  society.    The  Government  must  provide  employment 

avenues to our educated youth.  All facilities must be provided to drug-addicts and 

those suffering from mental diseases.  The agony of mental diseases is worse than 

the agony of cancer.  Those suffering from mental diseases have to bear the stigma 

of society.  The Government must come to the relief and succor of such people.  A 

mechanism should be in place to take care of the mentally ill persons so that they 

can lead a normal life.  This bill deals with a very sensitive issue.  A system should 

be  evolved  that  is  beneficial  for  the  poor  and  needy  mental  patients.    This  bill 

should be further refined whereby mentally ill people are traced and provide with 

all  facilities  to  lead  a  normal  life.    I  whole-heartedly  support  this  bill.    Funds 

should be provided to the State Governments to work for the welfare of mentally-

ill people.  Thank you.
