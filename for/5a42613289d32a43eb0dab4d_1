    Due  care  should  be 

taken  at  the  time  of  making  the  list  of  Scheduled  Castes  but  these  days  it  is 

observed that proposals are sent on the basis of party lines no matter which party is 

in  Government.    The  lists  of  the  Scheduled  Castes  and  the  Scheduled  Tribes  are 

always prepared through pressure tactics.  A certain caste is in the list of Scheduled 

Castes in a state and in the list of Scheduled Tribes in the other.  The same caste 

may  be  in  the  list  of  Backward  Classes  in  another  state.    This  is  because  socio-

economic  condition  of  that  caste  may  be  different  in  different  states.    The 

communities  which  are  powerful  and  land  owners,  financially  and  educationally 

sound are also in the race of getting into such list.  So, this issue has to be handled 

very  carefully.    We  generally  talk  on  the  basis  of  figures  but  the  fundamental 

question  is  as  to  by  when  the  problem  of  these  classes  will  be  solved.    Dr.  Baba 

Saheb Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi had an agreement known as 'Poona Pact'.  

In that Poon Pact they agreed to give certain percentage of reservation to the dalits, 

the  Scheduled  Castes  and  the  untouchables.    In  this  pact  also  they  agreed  to 

provide  reservation  in  proportion  to  the  population.   The  successive  governments 

have  been  continuing  with  the  reservation  because  the  condition  of  these  classes 

has not yet ameliorated.  If the reservation is to be discontinued, first bring about 

social reforms, end the practice of untouchability and provide level playing field to 

all.      This  problem  will  not  solve  until  there  is  social  equality.    Baba  Saheb 

Ambedkar  had  said  that  political  democracy  has  no  meaning  unless  we  achieve 

social democracy.  In such a situation, it is imperative to carry on with reservation.  

At the same time it is important to make it qualitative.
