  This  Bill  was  discussed  at  length  in  Lok 

Sabha  and  it  was  passed  with  certain  amendments.    But  in  Rajya  Sabha  some 

amendments were suggested, and accordingly, the Government has accepted them.  

I, on my own behalf and on behalf of my Party, support this Bill with all those new 

amendments.
