 This is one of the very good Bills 

drafted  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare.    So,  I  would  like  to 

congratulate  the  hon.  Minister  for  having  brought  forward  this  Bill.    There  is  a 

social stigma attached to this disease.  That has been removed by the provisions of 

this  Bill.    There  is  a  clause  in  the  insurance  policies,  which  excludes  HIV.    My 

request to the hon. Minister is, this clause should be removed because that person 

who has taken that health policy or the life policy should not be discriminated on 

the basis of HIV infection.  Secondly, if a couple is HIV infected and their health 

status is good, they should be given an opportunity for adoption.  There is a need to 

waive  the  consent  clause  for  conducting  HIV  tests  in  cases  when  the  patient  is 

suffering from severe  medical problem not responding to treatment.  It should be 

made mandatory in every hospital to have  a ventilator and a hemodialysis for the 

HIV  patients.    Today,  what  is  important  in  the  country  is  educating  the  youth, 

educating the  school-going  children  about  these diseases.   Many  a  times  we  hold 

the hospital responsible if the data is leaked about any  HIV infected person.  My 

request  is  that  instead  of  holding  the  hospital  responsible,  we  should  hold  the 

person who has leaked the data and he should be punished.  There are many cases 

where even doctors and staff have been infected with HIV in the course of saving 

the lives of the patients. So, I think in such cases compensation should be given to 

the doctor or the staff who has got infected with this.  Health related pre-marriage 

couselling should be stressed.
