  This  short  Bill,  seeks  to  amend  Section  9  of 

the  Representation  of  the  People's  Act,  1950  and  Section  11  of  the  Delimitation 

Act, 2002.  This Amendment becomes necessary since the new areas transferred to 

Cooch  Behar  District  have  to  be  incorporated  into  and  the  areas  ceded  must  be 

excluded from the relevant Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies.  The new 

citizens  have  to  be  provided  with  voting  rights.    There  is  an  urgency  to  the 

Amendment  as  the  State  is  poised  for  polls  in  the  coming  months.    During  the 

debate,  one  cannot  but  be  reminded  of  the  illegal  cession  of  Katchatheevu.    The 

islet  was  ceded  by  the  Congress  Government  way  back  in  1974.    The  Congress 

Government  in  1974  transferred  this  small  but  crucial  and  strategic  island  in  the 

Palk  Straits  over  to  Sri  Lanka  without  following  the  procedure  of  amending  the 

Constitution.  The transfer has deprived the Indian fishermen of their right to fish 

in  the  Indian  territorial  waters.    A  lot  is  expected  from  the  present  Government, 

which cannot afford to be a mute spectator to the atrocities of the Sri Lankan Navy.  

It  is  hoped  that  the  Union  Government,  would  seriously  address  this  issue  as  a 

national problem including the efforts to retrieve the islet.
