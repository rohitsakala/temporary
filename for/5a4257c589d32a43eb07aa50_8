 This Bill seeks to declare the IIMs as institutions of 

national  importance  and  it  is  good  that  this  Bill  will  empower  the  IIMs  to  award 

degrees,  which  they  could  not  do  in  the  last  sixty  years.    One  of  the  major 

objectives of this Bill is to give complete autonomy.  Academic autonomy is not a 

bad  idea  and  I  support  the  idea  of  academic  autonomy  with  adequate  safeguards 

and  accountability  but  still  there  are  some  issues  related  to  this  concept  of 

autonomy.    Who  will  appoint  the  Members  of  Board  of  Governors?    A  day  after 

tabling  this  Bill  in  Parliament,  the  Government  appointed  Directors  to  10  IIMs.  

They will serve for the next five years.   Why did you hastily appoint the Directors 

to the 10 IIMs immediately after the tabling of this Bill?  The Government should 

have refrained from  doing so. The IIMs are not only to be made autonomous but 

also to be made more inclusive, both socially and economically.  If you can have 

reservation  in  teaching  posts  in  the  IITs  and  still  maintain  the  excellence  and 

standards,  why  cannot  you  have  reservations  in  the  IIMs?    Why  are  you  not 

showing  the  courage  to  make  explicit  provision  for  providing  reservation  in 

teaching  posts  in  the  IIMs?    These  IIMs  should  not  be  solely  guided  by  the 

commercial principle of making money.  No student, who is otherwise deserving, 

should  be  denied  the  opportunity  to  study  in  the  IIMs  only  because  he  cannot 

afford the cost.
