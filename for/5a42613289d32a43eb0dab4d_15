  I  congratulate the  Government  for bringing 

the  proposed  legislation,  the  Constitution  (Scheduled  Castes)  Amendment  Bill, 

2017.  The amendment brought by the Government proposes certain modification 

in  the  list  of  Scheduled  Castes  by  way  of  inclusion  of  certain  communities,  like 

sualgiri/swalgalities,  caste  modification  and  removal  of  area  restriction  in  respect 

of certain communities I Odisha.  However, there is a need for proper revision in 

the list of Scheduled Castes so that the deprived communities in the country are not 

left  behind.  It  would  be  better  for  the  Scheduled  Caste  communities  if  one  time 

system  is  evolved  to  prepare  a  proposal  in  consultation  with  the  states  so  that  all 

such  castes  that  have  been  left  out  are  included  in  the  List  of  Scheduled  Castes. 

There is a need for the Government to conduct a caste-wise survey.  There is also a 

need  for  revision  of  this  list  in  Andhra  Pradesh  after  the  bifurcation  of  the  State.  

Inclusion of Budaga Jangam community is required by demanding entry 9, in Part 

I  of  Schedule-I,  section  2(1)  of  the  Constitution  SC/ST  Order  (Second 

Amendment) Act 2002.  There are certain nomads and tribes including Raj Gond 

tribe that  are  found  in  Guntur, Vijaywada  and  Ananthpur of  Andhra  Pradesh  that 

are vulnerable lot and needs to be included in the list for certain benefits as per the 

Constitution.
