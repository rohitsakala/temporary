  The  proposed  legislation 

seeks to amend the Indian Trusts Act 1882 to remove the outdated provisions.  The 

Amendment  will  help  the  trustee  to  invest  money  of  the  trust  in  Government 

securities.    It  is  a  welcome  step  to  provide  a  greater  autonomy  and  flexibility  to 

such  trustee  to  take  decisions  on  investment  of  trust  money  based  on  their 

assessment  of  the  risk-return  trade  off.  It  would  be  consistent  with  the  current 

economic  environment.    The  objectivity  of  the  trust  should  fall  within  the 

definition  of  charitable  norms.  Income  tax  return  of  the  trusts  should  be  filled 

regularly  and  if  there  is  any  irregularity,  the  trust  concerned  should  be 

derecognized.  Foreign contribution received by a particular trust should have the 

Government  clearance.   The  authorities concerned  should frequently  monitor that 

the  trusts  are  not  engaged  in  commercial  activities.    There  is  need  of  constant 

monitoring  of  the  trusts/NGOs  as  it  has  been  seen  that  these  violate  the  norms 

especially  with  regard  to  financial  dealings.    Our  party  supports  this  Amendment 

Bill.
