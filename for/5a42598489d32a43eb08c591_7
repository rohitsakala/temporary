  As  per  the  provisions  of 

Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014, the HRD Ministry have decided to set 

up  a  NIT  in  Andhra  Pradesh.    It  is  s  welcome  step  for  Andhra  Pradesh,  for  the 

country and also for all the people of Telangana.  The NIT has been set up to cater 

to the needs of the State of Andhra Pradesh which does not have NIT.  The State of 

Telangana  has  a  NIT  now  after  the  bifurcation.    So,  it  is  only  fair  that  Andhra 

Pradesh does have a NIT.  Just as NIT, IITs, AIIMS and research institutions are 

required,  they  also  require  a  High  Court  as  the  poor  people  of  Andhra  Pradesh 

cannot travel all the way to Hyderabad for justice.  Not only just to establish NIT, 

we also want the Central Government to provide us adequate funds as there is no 

building.    I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the 

Minister, just like NIT is very important for Andhra Pradesh, a tribal university in 

Telangana  also  is  very  important.    The  Government  should  establish  the  tribal 

university  in  Andhra  Pradesh  at  the  earliest.    The  number  of  seats  for  the  locals 

also can be considered to be increased because in Telangana we have IIITs, NITs 

and IITs.
