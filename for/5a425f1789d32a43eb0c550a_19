    The  Goods  and  Services  Tax  in  the 

country  would  help  the  Government  in  realization  of  the  objective  of  'One 

nation,  one  tax,  one  market',  which  would  also  improve  the  'ease  of  doing 

business' climate in the country. GST would reduce the tax burden, on the daily 

consumable  items.  It  would  mitigate  the  double  taxation  in  a  major  way.  The 

GST is expected to boost our GDP growth by about two per cent. GST would 

also  make  the  Indian  products  competitive  in  the  domestic  and  international 

markets. The GST regime will be bringing in more transparency and efficiency 

in  the  tax  administration  of  the  country.  This  will  lead  to  increase  in  revenue 

collection for the Centre and the States.
