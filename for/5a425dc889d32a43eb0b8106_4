    There  were  broadly  two 

categories, one is privacy and the other is identity risk.  We agreed to support the 

Bill  primarily    because  the  immediate  risks  are  much  lower  than  the  immediate 

benefits  and  for  our  State  the  immediate  benefits  are  very-very  significant.    I 

humbly request the Finance Minister to tell us the need for such urgency.
