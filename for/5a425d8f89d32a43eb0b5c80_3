    This  Bill  seeks  to  repeal  the  two  Acts
(i) the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959, and (ii) the State Bank of 

Hyderabad  Act,  1956.    This  is  consequent  to  the  Union  Cabinet  granting  its 

approval  in  February,  2017,  which  allowed  the  SBI  to  acquire  these  subsidiaries.  

The  State  Bank  of  India  had  decided  to  merge  the  five  associate  banks  from  1st 

April,  2017.    SBI  is  India's  largest  bank  with  assets  of  Rs.30.72  lakh  crore  and 

figures  at  No.  64  in  the  global  ranking  of  banks  as  of  December,  2015.  Post-

merger, with assets of approximately Rs.40 lakh crore, it will be among the top 50 

banks  in  the  world.  This  is  the  first  ever  large-scale  consolidation  in  the  Indian 

banking industry.  The merger will create a banking behemoth with an asset book 

value of Rs.37 lakh crore.  There are a few things which will be significant in this 

merger.    One  is  asset  quality.  By  virtue  of  being  the  country's  largest  lender,  the 

SBI  is  bound  to  have  bad  loans  on  its  books.    The  associate  banks,  too,  have 

accumulated  large  amounts  of  bad  loans.    Consolidation  would  help  in  better 

dealing with these accounts.  Second is profitability. Third is technology.  SBI has 

an active information technology department that works on a number of innovative 

solutions  for  the  bank.   I  wish  to  urge  upon  the  Government  to  provide  adequate 

compensation and benefits to the employees of the associate banks who may either 

opt  for  VRS  or  wish  to  continue  to  serve  in  SBI.    And  I  also  urge  upon  the 

government  to  continue  the  services  provided  by  these  associate  banks  to  the 

people of the country.
