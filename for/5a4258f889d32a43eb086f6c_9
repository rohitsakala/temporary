 The Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy 

is one of the prestigious Institutes granted to Andhra Pradesh after the bifurcation 

of  the  State  in  2014.    The  objective  of  this  university  should  be  to  meet  the 

quantitative  and  qualitative  gap  in  the  supply  of  skilled  manpower  for  the 

petroleum  sector  and  to  promote  research  activities  needed  for  the  growth  of  the 

sector.  To make the institute a world-class university, adequate infrastructure has 

to be provided.  The institute cannot function and provide qualitative research and 

internship programmes with only four faculty members.  The Government needs to 

consider this aspect.  I congratulate the Government for setting up IIPE in Andhra 

Pradesh and support the Bill.
