  The  bill  proposes  to  empower  the  central 

government to increase authorized capital of the National Bank for Agriculture and 

Rural  Development  Bank  (NABARD)  from  Rs.  5,000  crore  to  Rs.  30,000  crore.

The proposed increase in authorized capital would enable NABARD to respond to 

commitments it has undertaken, particularly in respect of the Long Term Irrigation 

Fund.  It will enable NABARD to augment its business and enhance its activities.  

Under  the  1981  Act,  NABARD  was  responsible  for  providing  credit  and  other 

facilities to industries having an investment of upto Rs. 20 lakh in machinery and 

plant. The present Bill extends this to apply to enterprises with investment upto Rs. 

10 crore in the manufacturing sector and Rs. five crore in the services sector.  The 

proposed  bill  thus  will  provide  more  scope  for  the  Government  to  provide 

agricultural loans to farmers in the country.  NABARD is planning to approve five 

projects in Tamil Nadu under various funding schemes. As many as 150 veterinary 

medical  centres  will  be  set  up  in  Tamil  Nadu  at  an  estimated  cost  of  Rs.  49.09 

Crore  with  assistance  from  NABARD.    NABARD  has  announced  that  it  would 

disburse Rs. 500 crore to support the State government’s ‘kudimaramathu’ scheme.  

NABARD  should  support  the  state  government  in  addressing  agrarian  distress 

related  issues.    I  urge  upon  the  Union  government  to  allocate  sufficient  funds  by 

way of grants to Tamil Nadu for extension, restoration and modernisation of canals 

and water bodies in the State. Both NABARD and Union Government should help 

for the implementation of such schemes benefitting the farmers of this country.
