 I support the Demand for Grants of 

the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Farmers  Welfare.  I  would  like  to  urge  upon  the 

Government  to  make  efforts  for  the  development  of  inaccessible  Yamuna  stretch 

from  Agra  to  Allahabad  on  the  scale  of  Bundelkhand  with  the  initiative  of  State 

government. The face of villages is changing with the implementation of Pradhan 

Mantri  Krishi  Sinchayee  Yojana,  Soil  Health  Card  Scheme,  Neem  coated  Urea, 

National  Agriculture  Market,  agricultural  loan  flow,  animal  husbandry,  dairy 

development schemes.
