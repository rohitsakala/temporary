  I  support  the  demand  for  grants 

relating to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation for the year 2016-

17  and  appreciate  the  Minister  in  charge  for  the  efforts  being  made  for  poverty 

alleviation.  The government has envisaged to provide shelter to all the urban poor 

and employment opportunities to unemployed by the year 2022 and several schemes 

are  being  implemented  to  achieve  this  goal.    A  strong  monitoring  mechanism  has 

been  put  in  place  to  monitor  the  scheme  being  implemented.    Technical  assistance 

will be provided for poverty alleviation and Urban Mission Management Units will 

be set up in which experts will be included.  Skill training programmes will be run 

for  ensuring  employment  and  after  imparting  skill  training,  facilities  will  be 

provided to the people for starting self employment ventures.  There will be focus on 

encouraging innovative  initiatives.   There  will be  a focus  on  creating opportunities 

for  long  term  sustainable  means  of  livelihood.    The  most  important  point  is  that 

National  Urban  Livelihood  Mission  has  been  launched  to  redress  the  problems  of 

Urban Poor.  I am sure that the government will succeed in its endeavours.
