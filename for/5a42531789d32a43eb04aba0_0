  We live in a security context which is 

 

 

very difficult.  To the West, we have an implacable enemy.  We have fought four 

wars  with  that  country.    Even  now,  it  persists  in  trying  to  hurt  us  by  using 

irregulars  and  terrorists.      To  the  North,  we  have  a  very  strong  enemy.    All  our 

attempts to stabilize that border, to even draw up the Line of Actual Control have 

failed  because  of  the  obduracy  of  China.      Therefore,  we  have  to  be  ready  for  a 

two-front  war.  We have  to strengthen  our  forces  keeping  this security  context in 

mind.    Our  modernization  and  strengthening  of  our  forces  are  proceeding  apace.  

We need to strengthen our Army, our Navy and our Air Force.  I believe and our 

party believes that our defence comes first and foremost and for that, finances will 

never  be  a  problem.    That  is  something  which  we  will  stand  by  and  we  aim  at 

achieving  a  capability  which  will  deter  and,  if  necessary,  defeat  any  of  our 

adversaries.
