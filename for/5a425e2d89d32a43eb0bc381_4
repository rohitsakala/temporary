  I  stand  here  to  welcome  and  support  the 

Repealing  and  Amending  (Fourth)  Bill,  2015.    Law  is  to  ensure  easy  access  to 

justice  to  all.    There  have  been  a  plethora  of  laws  on  the  same  subject  in  India.  

Sometimes, they are very much contradictory laws.  We have to keep the laws to 

the  minimum  extent  of  what  is  required  for  the  country  as  not  all  laws  can  be 

implemented.  Many of the laws are of British era.  So many laws are there which 

are not relevant today and have become obsolete.  That is why the police and the 

other machinery are suffering.  In fact, ultimately, the public is suffering.  Because 

of the plethora of laws, millions of cases are pending in our courts.  There is a need 

to integrate the similar laws to eliminate the laws which are useless and to make a 

concerted  effort  for  the  judicial  reforms  in  this  country.    In  1998  when  the  NDA 

was in Government under the leadership of Shri Atal Bihar Vajpayee, a panel was 

constituted.    It  recommended  that  1832  laws  had  to  be  repealed  in  this  country.  

More than 400 laws were repealed.  On the basis of the Law Commission's Report 

and the P.C. Jain Commission Report, they recommended that 1741 laws are to be 

repealed.    Today, 295 Acts are to be repealed.  I would also request the hon. Law 

Minister  that  there  should  be  an  automatic  repeal  clause.    Section  6A  of  the 

General Clauses Act should also be amended.  There should be a time bound action 

to  repeal  obsolete,  redundant  and  unnecessary  laws.    To  ensure  that  we  have 

maximum governance, we require less and less laws.
