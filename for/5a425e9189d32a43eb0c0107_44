  Due  to  indifferent  monsoon  and  lack  of 

employment  the  condition  of  villages  is  very  poor  but  the  condition  of  poor  in  the 

city is even worse. Nearly 9.3 crore people live in slums in the country and there is a 

shortage of 1.8 crore houses. It is Prime Minister's dream to provide everyone with a 

house  by  the  year  2022.  The  Government  has  introduced  Deen  Dayal  Aantyodya 

Yojana  -  National  Urban  Livelihood  Mission  for  the  poor  living  in  cities.  The 

Government  has  introduced  Swachh  Bharat  Mission  Programme  for  Urban  areas. 

The  Mission  is  targeted  towards  providing  1.04  crore  families  with  community 

toilets,  2.6  lakh  public  toilets  and  an  arrangement  for  solid  waste  management  in 

every  city. The  Government  is sensitive  towards  all  the poor people in  the  country 

and is committed for the development of every citizen in the country.
