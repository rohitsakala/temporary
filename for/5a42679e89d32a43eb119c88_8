  Since  the  NABARD  has 

been created by an Act of Parliament, further increase on the capital can be done 

with the consultation of RBI or it has to come to the Parliament.  That is my first 

question.  Government wants to have more employment, particularly in rural areas.  

We  should  really  encourage  the  rural  industries  by  infusing  more  funds  to 

NABARD.  Now, the development is entirely lopsided.  So, therefore, to bridge the 

gap  between  these  urban  and  rural  areas  more  funds  may  be  given  to  the 

NABARD.  Besides, NABARD bank may come forward to develop the backward 

areas  of  Venkatagiri.    We  have  only  one  important  lifeline,  i.e.  Telugue  Ganga 

which is really starved of the funds.  Perhaps the NABARD Bank could give more 

loans for this particular project of Telugue Ganga.  Presently, rural infrastructure, 

particularly,  roads,  drainages  and  community  halls,  etc.    are  grossly  inadequate.  

Similarly,  I  would  request  the  Government  to  give  a  roadmap  so  that  they  could 

improve  the  agricultural  income  year-by-year.    The  Government  of  India  should 

come  forward  to  give  more  funds  to  NABARD  so  that  connectivity  and  internet 

services  could  be  given  more  in  the  villages.  I  would  also  suggest  that  the 

NABARD should come in a big way so that the cooperative banks and the central 

cooperative banks could be protected.  As I was telling earlier, the loan pattern is 

lopsided.  I would suggest that since it is a national wealth it could be distributed 

amongst all sections of the people as per the pro rata of the population.
