  There is no basis of these objections.  This is in the 

national  interest  that  we  had  to  withdraw  this  Bill  which  was  there  earlier.    This 

same  Bill  was  passed  in  Rajya  Sabha  in  2013.    But  because  the  Lok  Sabha  was 

dissolved in 2014, the Bill could not be passed in Lok Sabha.  That is why we have 

come out with a new Bill.  As far as promulgation of an Ordinance is concerned, 

since the hon. Prime Minister had made a commitment on behalf of the country, it 

is  our  duty  to  ensure  that  the  commitment  is  completely  followed  upon.    That  is 

why there is no basis and proper reason for objecting to this Bill. 

The Bill was introduced.
