  Steamers would facilitate people 

and  benefit  the  people  of  State.  Employment  would  be  generated  and    tourism 

would  be  promoted.  National  waterways  are  also  being  conducted  many  stations 

are being developed. There is very less distance between National Waterways and 

States, these should be linked through the scheme.
