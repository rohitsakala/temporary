 World Health Organisation indicates that 

nearly  25  per  cent  of  the  world's  population  are  affected  by  mental  illness.  This 

Bill  guarantees  every  person  the  right  to  access  mental  healthcare  and  treatment 

from mental health services run by the Government.  This will ensure good quality 

mental health services at affordable cost.  The most significant aspect of this Bill is 

decriminalization  of  suicide.    It  is  necessary  to  show  sympathy  and  be 

compassionate  rather  than  prosecute  such  a  person.    I  also  welcome  coverage  of 

medical  insurance  for  mentally  ill  persons  on  the  same  basis  as  is  available  for 

physical  illnesses.   Similarly,  I  request  the  Government  to  educate  the  people  on 

mental health so that the stigma attached to it in the society can be got rid of.  For 

this, publicity and education on a large scale is required.  Though the objectives of 

this  Bill  are  laudable,  the  success  lies  in  the  quick  implementation  of  the 

provisions  and  setting  up  of  necessary  medical infrastructure  at  the  district  level. 

Therefore, I request the hon. Minister to ensure that all district level hospitals are 

equipped  to  handle  the  patients  suffering  from  mental  illness.    In  this  regard, 

adequate  training  is  to  be  imparted  to  the  medical  and  para  medical  staff  for 

handling the patients with sensitivity and care.
