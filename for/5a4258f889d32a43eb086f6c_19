 I rise to support the Bill.  I congratulate 

the  NDA  Government  led  by  the  Prime  Minister  for  honouring  the  commitment 

made by the UPA Government in this regard.  In the petroleum sector, we do not 

have an institute of national importance.  We have to convert this into an institute 

of global importance.  I feel that this Institute will provide and deliver professional 

experts in the field of oil and gas sector.  State of Rajasthan has abundant resources 

of  oil.   But  unfortunately  we  are  not  able  to  explore oil  in  Rajasthan  and  Assam.  

Prime importance should be given to oil exploration for which self-sufficiency in 

oil exploration technology is also highly required.  I hope this Institute will help a 

lot towards that end.  IOCL, HPCL, BPCL, ONGC and all other organizations in 

the  petroleum  and  natural  gas  sector  should  be  protected.    In  my  constituency, 

Hindustan Petroleum Company stopped its entire operations 20 years back and 27 

acres of land is lying.  I urge upon the hon. Minister to start some institute in that 

place and utilize that land.   

 

SHRI  RAVINDER  KUSHAWAHA:  I  support  the  Indian  Institute  of 

Petroleum  and  Energy  Bill,  2017.    This  institute  will  play  a  major  role  in  the 

development and this will be a big step.  Our youths will get quality education and 

serve the petroleum sector.  It is my desire that a Transport University should also 

be  set  up  on  these  lines  so  that  accidents  can  come  down.    Similarly,  Rail 

University should also be set up.
