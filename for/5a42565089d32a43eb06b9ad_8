  The  present  juvenile  justice  system  has 

proved  to  be  ineffective  and  required  better  implementation,  but  the  new 

amendment  would  be  too  harsh  on  juveniles  and  would  make  them  bitter.    The 

proposed  amendment  says  juveniles  above  16  years  could  be  treated  at  par  with 

adults if involved in heinous crimes, like rape and murder.  The decision to amend 

the  Juvenile  Justice  Act  came  after  the  outrage  that  followed  the  verdict  in  the 

December  2013  bus  gang  rape  case  in  Delhi.    Almost  50  per  cent  of  all  sexual 

crimes in the country are committed by 16 year old who know the Juvenile Justice 

Act. The Government has adopted a welcome move which prevents children from 

exploitation  at  the  hands  of  criminal  gangs  which  specifically  hire  minors.    The 

current justice system was not helping in reformation of juveniles in conflict with 

law and this amendment is a way to tell these offenders that they would not be let 

off easily for committing heinous crimes. The children who become criminal need 

to  be  rehabilitated  irrespective  of  the  reasons  or  conditions  under  which  they 

committed crime.  Punishment is no measure.
