  Governments  after  Governments  since 

independence  are  promising  housing  for  all  in  rural  and  urban  areas.    The  most 

alarming  matter  today  is  that  large  scale  migration  of  rural  people  to  urban  areas.  

Government  has  to  create  employment,  in  rural  areas,  especially  in  Agricultural 

sectors  and  cottage  industries.    My  Parliamentary  Constituency  consists  of  two 

districts  viz.    Bargarh,  which  is  the  rice  bowl  of  Odisha  and  Jharsungda  District 

which  is  the  Industrial  Capital  of  Odisha.    Here  basic  amenities  are  yet  to  be 

addressed like drinking water, drainage etc.  Even today, people are not getting clean 

water  to  drink  in  many  places.    I  will  urge  upon  the  Hon'ble  Minister  to  declare 

Bangarh  and  Jharsungda  town  as  "  Smart  Cities"  for  overall  development  of  these 

two towns.
