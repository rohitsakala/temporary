  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  hon. 

Minister  for  bringing  the  Mental  Healthcare  Bill,  2016  as  it  is  a  welcome  move.  

This is the good thing that all the persons suffering from mental disorders will be 

able to get medical coverage after the Bill is passed.   In this respect, I would like 

to  make  a  request  that  a  person  attempting  to  commit  suicide  should  be  given 

treatment  instead  of  registering  a  criminal  case  against  him.    The  hon.  Minister 

should pursue this matter with the Ministry of Law in order to make provisions to 

this  effect.    The  insurance  companies  should  be  given  strict  orders  facilitating 

proper treatment of such patients at an affordable premium.  We will have to make 

proper  budgetary  provision  for  the  treatment  of  such  patients  in  2017-18  budget.  

A  punitive  provision  of  this  Bill  providing  for  imprisonment  of  six  months  or  a 

penalty  of  Rs.10,000  or  both  for  the  non-compliance  of  the  provision  is 

insufficient according to me.  At the same time, the persons suffering from mental 

stress can also be accommodated by converting Nirbhaya Kendras into Counseling 

Centres.
