 Through you, I would like to submit few points 

before 

the  government. 

  Some  of  our  colleagues  have  expressed 

their 

apprehensions about this Bill and I would like to clarify in this regard that this Bill 

proposes to make certain amendments in few acts and to repeal certain enactments 

which  are  consequential  to  the  enactments  proposed  to  be  enacted  for  the 

introduction  of  goods  and  services  tax.    It  does  not  involve  any  financial 

implication.    So  there  is  no  need  to  worry  about.    In  the  coming  years,  this  will 

prove to be the largest economic reform in the country.  I would also like to submit 

that there should be no objection about the penalty provisions for not providing the 

required  information.    It  should  be  our  moral  and  constitutional  responsibility  to 

provide information which has been asked to provide under the provisions of this 

act.
