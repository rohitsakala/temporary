  This  is  a  very  important  Bill.    I  am  of  this 

opinion that we will be in a position to do justice with the people connected to each 

profession  if  we  are  to  bring  such  a  Bill  which  seeks  to  establish  the  institution 

related  to  concerned  professions.    Initially,  I  thought  that  these  were  only  design 

and development institutes.  But they have research aspect also.  I congratulate the 

hon. Minister for that.  There should be a provision  of 20-25 per cent reservation 

of  seats  in  the  institutes  to  be  set  up  under  this  law  for  the  communities  which 

traditionally pursue such profession.  This law provides for national level institutes 

and  management  thereof  has  been  finalized.    A  council  will  be  formed  and 

management  will  be  done  through  senate.    If  we  are  going  for  research,  it  is 

imperative to have a scientist as its Chairman.  The Government should retain the 

power of appointment of the Managing Director.  The Government would appoint 

an experienced person who could effectively control the institute.  Approximately, 

12  campuses  are  likely  to  be  set  up  in  each  state.    I  want  to  suggest  that  these 

institutes should be at district level to effectively train the unemployed rural youth. 

It is my suggestion that this initiative should not be kept confined for the sake of a 

single  institute,  its  campus  should  be  established  not  only  at  12  places  but  at 

various places as our country is quite large.  Its campus should be set up in every 

district.    Centres  for  different  industries  through  skill  development  have  been  set 

up at various places to fulfill the dream of our hon. Prime Minister.  It should be 

ensured that they function in a proper manner.  This is a good Bill in view of the 

importance of this subject.  I appreciate it and support it.
