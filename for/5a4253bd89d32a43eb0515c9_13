  This  Bill  should  have  been 

introduced  much  earlier.    The  entire  country  was  shaken  when  the  Kandhar 

incident took place.  We have to come to terms with the hijackers of the plane.  So, 

it  was  incumbent  upon  us  to  think  about  the  formulation  of  stringent  law  for  the 

security of the air passengers.   

 

SHRI  GEORGE  BAKER:  I  would  like  to  say  that  if  proper  electronic 

equipment is used at airports, it would not only prevent hijackers from being able 

to enter with certain equipments on their body, it would also prevent incidents of 

the smuggling of gold which recently happened at Kolkata Airport. In the case of 

plane hijack the stress should be laid on saving the people and thereafter providing 

proper compensation to all the passengers of the plane.
