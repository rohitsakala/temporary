  Leather  industry  is  a  very  old 

industry and the history bears testimony to it that this industry has been providing 

employment to lots of people in the various parts, regions and villages since  time 

immemorial.  But, it is unfortunate that this vocation was confined to some castes 

only earlier which were looked upon as backward classes and this was the darker 

aspect  of  this  vocation.    The  Footwear  Design  and  Development  Institute  Bill  is 

definitely such a step that is viewed as the need of the hour of the day.  India is the 

third biggest market of footwear.  Hence, it would be difficult for us to stand in this 

age  of  competitive  market  if  we  continue  to  follow  our  traditional  ways  in  this 

sector.   

 

It  is  estimated  that  this  business  will  be  worth  $220.2  billion  by  the  year 

2020.    So  these  institutes  and  educational  institutes  are  mandatory  to  face  the  

global competition wherein we may provide education to our children  on the basis 

of modern technology.  I feel that Government should take firm decision to secure 

and  strengthen  the  future  of  students  having  technical  education  and  I  am  of  the 

opinion  that  through  these  institutes  we  would  definitely  achieve  the  target 

pertaining to skill development and employment.
