  I  would  like  to  suggest  that  the 

Dream City Project launched by the Gujarat Government should be implemented in 

other  States  also  and  the  Union  Government  should  formulate  policy  to  encourage 

them  in  this  regard.    The  States  should  be  encouraged  to  harness  energy  from  the 

solid  waste.    The  increasing  urbanisation  has  made  it  imperative  to  construct 

flyovers. 

  For  this  purpose,  the  Municipal  Corporations  and  the  District 

Headquarters  should  be  allocated  sufficient  funds.    The  government  should  review 

the ban on the diesel vehicles imposed by the Government of Delhi from 1st May.  

The  government  should  make  arrangement  for  green  belts  to  check  the  growing 

pollution in urban areas and formulate a policy to look for the alternatives of private 

vehicles and increase the CNG run taxis and autos.  Strict steps should be taken to 

solve  the  problem  of  traffic  jam  in  urban  areas.    The  government  should  provide 

training  and  employment  opportunities  to  the  urban  poor  under  National  Urban 

Employment  Mission  and  Skill  Development  Programme.   The  government  should 

set up river fronts and adventure units on the rivers which pass through or nearby the 

urban  areas.    The  government  should  provide  amusement  facilities,  garden  and 

parks.  The government can also set up small markets to be run by the women self 

help groups which will help in generating urban employment.
