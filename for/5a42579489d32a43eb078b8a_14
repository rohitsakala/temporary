  The  Government  has  reduced  the  number  of 

man days from 240 days to 150 days required for incentive scheme for industrial 

sector.    Through  this  Bill  surplus  land  of  VSNL  is  going  to  be  transferred  to  the 

government which will ultimately benefit the housing sector of the country.  This 

will  also  give  impetus  to  the  garment  and  apparel  industry  and  employment 

opportunity will also be increased.  Production cost of garment would be reduced 

and  it  will  strengthen  the  apparel  industry.    This  is  a  very  big  step  towards 

providing relief to small tax payers through taxation and tax regime.  This Bill will 

also boost the housing sector.  Agriculture and rural economy is also going to be 

benefited from it.
