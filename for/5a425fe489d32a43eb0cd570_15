  The  Government  has  brought  this 

Bill in the House to give a legal status to the Ordinance it had brought earlier.  The 

Government  proposes  to  include  certain  castes  from  the  state  of  Chhattisgarh, 

Haryana, Kerala, Odisha and West Bengal through the amendment Bill, 1950.  The 

Bihar  government  has  also  forwarded  six  proposals  to  the  Union  Government 

which  are  pending.    I  would  request  the  hon.  Minister  for  their  inclusion  in  the 

order as well.
