 This Institute is very essential.  It is being set up 

in  Vizag,  which  already  has  a  petroleum  refinery.    It  is  close  to  the  Krishna-

Godavari  Basin  where  oil  has been  found.    It  is ideally  situated.   This institute is 

being set up as a follow up of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014 where 

it was promised that Andhra Pradesh will have a new petroleum institute.  Now, as 

far as this Institute is concerned, it is being structured in the likes of the IITs. The 

only  thing  is  that  the  hon.  Minister  has  to  bring  another  Bill  so  that  it  can  be 

declared  as  an  Institute  of  national  importance.    I  want  the  Minister  to  make  this 

new Institute free from the apron string of the Government.  Let all these things be 

decided by the Governing Council of the Institute itself.  It is of great importance 

to  find  more  petroleum  sources.    Oil  exploration  had  started  in  the  Sundarban's 

area  of  West  Bengal  but  that  was  given  up.    I  would  urge  the  hon.  Minister  to 

ensure that the exploration for petroleum can take place in the Bay of Bengal Basin 

of West Bengal.  I would like to request the Government to also initiate the Post-

Graduate courses immediately, also to start doctoral research.
