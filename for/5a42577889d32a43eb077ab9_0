 The Collection of Statistics Act, 2008 as of now 

extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  The Jammu 

and Kashmir Collection of Statistics Act, 2010 passed by the Jammu and Kashmir 

Legislature extends to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  Both the above laws do 

not  cover  matters  specified  in  the  Union  List,  that  is  List  1,  in  the  Seventh 

Schedule  to  the  Constitution.   The  Central  Act  does  not  extend  upto  the  State  of 

Jammu and Kashmir.  So, we want to extend its jurisdiction.  For that reason I am 

bringing this Bill.  The other amendments in the Bill are on three issues. The first 

one  is  designating  a  nodal  officer  at  the  Centre  and  in  each  State  for  providing 

guidance to line Departments in avoiding unnecessary duplication in collection of 

statistics.    The  second  one  is  intended  to  provide  for  an  appropriate  enabling 

provision in the Principal Act to provide for rule making power in the manner in 

which information collected shall be used.  The third one is intended to provide for 

an  appropriate  enabling  provision  in  the  Principal  Act  regarding  the  condition  of 

previous  publication  of  rules  made  under  the  Act.    This  makes  the  rule  making 

process more transparent.
