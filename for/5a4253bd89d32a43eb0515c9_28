  We  are  facing  a  lot  of 

problems  in  Uttarakhand.  The  Bill  is  being  discussed.  Hon.  Prime  Minister  has 

done  a  lot  for  Uttarakhand.  We  support  him.  We  had  gone  through  a  lot  of 

problems in 2013 when the Government was of Congress. Today, I would like to 

say that we must be more practical and let Parliament like a Parliament and not like 

a machhi bazaar. We only talk about each other. But the people, who are suffering, 

are  suffering.  Uttarakhand  people  need  the  support  of  our  Government.  The 

support will only come if we are with the people.
