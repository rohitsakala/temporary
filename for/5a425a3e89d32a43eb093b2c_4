 The objective of the Bill is to 

establish  Footwear  Design  and  Development  Institute  as  an  institute  of  national 

importance.    It  empowers  the  Institute  to  grant  degrees,  which  was  very  much 

needed  because  there  was  a  huge  ambiguity  over  this.    We  had  a  great  legacy  of 

crafts in footwear and leather tanning industry.  We used to have vegetable tanning 

and we made various concoctions of tanning liquor and we have forgotten about all 

that.  There is a huge potential to revive this industry and this Bill is very timely.  

One of the things is hand-made leather which is an art and a craft.  They are best 

taught through apprenticeship system.  I think one of the things we need to focus 

through this institute is the apprenticeship system.  One of the things the institute 

need to focus is to look for niche market and promoting niche products from India.  

It is not only the leather products but the tanning products, tanning chemicals, and 

natural tanning too have a potential market.  The poorest of the poor are involved 

in this industry.  In Telangana, typically it is either the minorities or the Scheduled 

Castes who are involved in this industry.  A mega leather park in Jangaon has been 

started  in  Telangana.    We  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  support  that.    In  my 

constituency  15  acres  of  land  has  been  allocated  and  the  institute  has  been 

completed.  We request the hon. Minister to inaugurate it soon.  The total project 

cost  of  our  leather  park  is  about  Rs.270  crore  of  which  Rs.165  crore  is  from  the 

State Government.  We request the Union Government to give us Rs. 105 crore for 

the  leather  park.    I  congratulate  the  Minister  because  this  Bill  is  very  timely  and 

needed.
