  I  wholehearted  support  this 

Bill.    The  Britishers  had  played  a  mischief  in  1944  by  introducing  a  new  clause 

regarding  Sahajdharis.    In  year  2003,  the  government  led  by  the  honourable 

Vajpayee Saheb issued a notification to do justice to us.  Some people moved the 

court.    The  honourable  Supreme  Court  has  ruled  that  amendment  cannot  be 

effected through notification and it should be through legislature.  That is why the 

government has introduced this Bill.  The people who are real Sikh and respect the 

sanctity of Gurudwara have the right to manage them.   

 

SHRI  CHARANJEET  SINGH  RORI: 

I  and  my  party 

INLD 

wholeheartedly support this Bill.  Sikhs are present in all parts of India.  They are 

present in large number in Haryana too.  They have always been at the vanguard to 

protect the country.  The previous Congress Government in Haryana tried to divide 

the Sikh brotherhood.  It tried to set up a separate SGPC for the Sikhs of Haryana.  

It  was  a  divisive  policy.    But  the  Sikhs  of  Haryana  did  not  fall  in  this  trap  and 

SGPC  remains  united.    This  bill  seeks  to  unite  and  strengthen  the  Sikh 

brotherhood.  It is a move in the right direction.  All the Sikhs welcome this Bill.  

We should pass this Bill unanimously.
