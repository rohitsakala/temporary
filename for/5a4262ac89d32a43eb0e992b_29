  I  would  confine  my  speech  to 

inland  waterways,  Allahabad-Haldia  stretch  of  Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hughli  river.  

Imported  coal  from  Indonesia  is  being  carried  through  river    Bhagirathi  from 

Haldia to Farakka, NTPC, by big-size ships and vessels.  When such waves hit the 

banks of the river, erosion takes place.  And this erosion is affecting both the banks 

of the river.  If we do some regular dredging in the riverbed, such erosion can be 

stopped.  We have to repair the embankment of the river on a regular basis.  Then 

we  can stop this  erosion.   I urge upon the  Government to send  an  expert  team  to 

survey the actual ground situation and take a report from them and do the needful.
