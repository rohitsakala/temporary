  Azhikkal sea  port at Kannur, if developed, can 

become one of the best natural sea ports in India and would facilitate foreign trade.  

There is a lot of possibilities to develop water canals from Calicut area to Sultanpet 

in Kasargod, that is, North Kerala, which can be easily connected for the purpose 

of promoting tourism as well as movement of goods and people.
