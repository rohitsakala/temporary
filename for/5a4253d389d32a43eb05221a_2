 I thank the Government for 

having introduced this important piece of legislation.  Till date, the maritime law in 

India is being governed by the old British laws.    I have come across such matters 

and  litigations  wherein  the  even  issues  regarding  the  jurisdiction  of  cases  takes 

years to get settled.  The jurisdiction of the High Courts is also specified in Section 

3  of  the  Act  which  says  that  the  jurisdiction  under  this  Act  shall  vest  in  the 

respective High Courts.  The salient features of this law are the application of the 

Code of Civil Procedure where the law is silent and where the action is needed, in 

that case, the Code of Civil Procedure can be brought in.  Secondly, there is action 

in rem and action in personam .  Thirdly, Section 4 of the Act specifically provides 

for which are the claims that can be settled under this Act.  These are some of the 

salient  features  of  this  Bill.   The  market  size  of the  maritime  trade  is  on  rise.   In 

2016  it  is  expected  the  trade  to  reach  about  1715  million  metric  tonnes.    The 

Government  expects  that  there  is  a  growth  of  around  18 per  cent in the  maritime 

trade.    This  growth  in  maritime  trade  is  itself  likely  to  lead  to  greater  number  of 

disputes. This Bill seeks to tackle this problem.  This legislation, in my opinion, is 

another step towards making Indian as a business destination.
