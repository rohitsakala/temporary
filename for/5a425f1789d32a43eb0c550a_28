  We are having discussion on GST 

from  2005  onwards.    We  know  that  it  is  a  paradigm  shift  in  the  interest  tax 

regime.  This is a structural change in the indirect tax system.  It is a significant 

improvement  in  the  indirect  tax  reforms  also.    We  hope  that  it  will  definitely 

benefit  the  national  economy.    It  will  also  be  benefitting  in  the  case  of  tax 

compliance.  We are all hopeful that the country's indirect tax collection will be 

benefitted.    My  apprehension  is  regarding  the  federal  structure  of  the  Indian 

Constitution.   The  States  have  the  freedom  to  pursue  their  own  fiscal  policies.  

If the State Government wants to raise the rate of tax, the State Government has 

to approach the GST  Council for getting the rate of tax increased.  That means 

the  fiscal  autonomy  of  the  States  have  been  abrogated  by    means  of  GST 

legislation.    Federal  character  is  the  basic  structure  of  the  Indian  Constitution.   

Clause  9  of  the  Central  GST  Bill  stipulates  that  the  Central  Government  shall 

levy and impose tax at a rate not exceeding 20 per cent and this will be notified 

by  the  Government  on  the  advice  of  the  GST  Council.    The  legislative 

supremacy  of  Parliament  is  being  taken  away  by  the  GST  Council  and  the 

Government will notify the rate of tax.    That is against the basic principle of 

our  Constitution.    GST  Council  is  getting  arbitrary  discretionary  authority  to 

impose  cess  on  any  item.   I  hope that it will benefit the nation  as a  whole but 

unfortunately the Central Government is benefitted more than the States.
