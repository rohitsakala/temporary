 The State governments of Chhattisgarh, Haryana, 

Kerala, Odisha and West Bengal had sent a proposal regarding certain amendments 

in the scheduled castes order, 1950.  After obtaining necessary approval from RGI, 

these  proposals  were  forwarded  to  National  Schedule  Caste  Commission  to  get 

their opinion in this regard.  National Schedule Caste Commission has also given 

its consent in this regard.  And thus we have completed all the procedures involved 

in it.  After that this Bill has been presented here for further amendments.  In this 

Bill, certain  synonymous  communities  have  been  mentioned regarding  Ghasi  and 

Ghasiya  castes  in  Chhattisgarh.    We  have  decided  to  include  those  castes.  

Similarly,  certain  new  castes  like  Aheria,  Aheri,  Hari,  Heri,  Thori,  Turi  and  Rai 

Sikh  are  being  included  in  Schedule  Caste  list.    Again,  areas  are  being  extended 

with  regard  to  certain  castes  in  Kerala.    Provisions  have  been  made  to  include 

synonymous communities for Mannan, Pathiya, Perumannan, Peruvannan, Vannan 

and Velan in the entry number 37 with regard to Kerala state.  Two castes namely 

Bariki  and  Kumahari  are  being  deleted  with  regard  to  Odisha  list.    Regional 

restrictions applicable to Chein Caste in West Bengal is being withdrawn and this 

caste  is  being  included  in  the  West  Bengal  Scheduled  Caste  list  with  all  state 

eligibility.
