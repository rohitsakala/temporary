 I would like to congratulate the hon. 

Minister  for  bringing  the  Bill  for  the  persons  with  disabilities.  Five  per  cent 

reservation should be provided for them keeping in view their increasing numbers.  

I  would  also  like  to  state  that  a  National  Commission  for  the  disabled  should  be 

constituted.    A  nationwide  survey  on  them  should  be  conducted  and  at  the  same 

time  all  of  their  difficulties  should  be  addressed  too.    Moreover,  I  would  like  to 

request that they should be provided monthly pension of Rs.3000.  There should be 

separate  arrangements  for  them  at  hospitals  and  railway  stations  so  that  they  can 

avail the facilities meant for them without any inconvenience.
