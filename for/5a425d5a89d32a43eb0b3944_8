   Through this Amendment Bill, the 

Government is trying to address the anomalies in the salaries and pensions of the 

High Court judges.  It was quite urgent to bring changes in the salary pension and 

service condition of the judges of both the High Courts and the Supreme Courts in 

tune with the changing times.  It is matter of concern that more than three and half 

crore cases are pending with various courts of the country.  This problem should be 

addressed immediately.  The vacant posts of the judges in all the High Courts and 

the Supreme Court should be filled so that cases could be settled on time besides 

vacant posts should not be allowed to continue in the lower courts also.
