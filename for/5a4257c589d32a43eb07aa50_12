  I  would  like  to  extend  my  thanks  to  the  hon. 

Prime  Minister  and  the  wise  minister  for  declaring  Indian  Institutes  of 

Management as the institutions of national importance and providing autonomy to 

these  institutes.    I  believe  this  is  the  best  example  of  the  minimum  government, 

maximum governance.  Today, this will go a long way in meeting the shortage of 

faculty in IIMs.  Moreover, this Bill will empower these management institutions 

to award degrees.  This will provide three types of autonomy to these institutions 

namely educational autonomy, administrative autonomy and economic autonomy.  

I  would  like  to  urge  the  hon.  Minister  to  develop  such  a  mechanism  that  may 

enable  the  poor to afford  the  fee and have  access  to education  in  the  institutes of 

national  importance  like  Indian  Institutes  of  Management.    I  would  also  like  to 

urge the hon. Minister to make syllabus of these institutes reflective of the ground 

reality.  I support this Bill.
