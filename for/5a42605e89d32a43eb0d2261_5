  I  stand  here  to  support  the  Bill  on 

behalf  of  Biju  Janata  Dal  and  the  people  of  Odisha.    With  six  more  new  IITs 

coming up, the seats will increase to 20,000 to 25,000.  Eight years back, eight IITs 

were declared by the last UPA Government.  Out of eight IITs that have come up, 

except  IIT,  Bhubaneswar,  Odisha  and  IIT,  Mandi,  rest  six  IITs  have  missed  the 

deadline  of  starting  their  construction  as  per  the  original  schedule.    Almost  all 

these IITs except one Institute, do not have faculty.  We would sincerely urge upon 

you  to  please  focus  on  quality.    The  IITs  were  meant  for  innovation,  research, 

quality  and  development.    Today,  money  is  playing  a  big  role  in  the  entrance 

examinations.  This is virtually diluting the higher education system in the country.  

I  would  like  to  urge  upon  the  Government  to  kindly  stop  the  system  of  ragging.  

Existing IITs need family planning instead of more brothers and sisters.
