 I support the Admiralty (Jurisdiction 

and Settlement of Maritime Claims) Bill, 2016.  The Government is changing the 

law  prevailing  from  the  British  times  through  this  Bill.    I  would  like  to  draw  the 

attention  of  the  Government  on  an  important  point  pertaining  to  the  smuggling 

through  the  maritime  route,  supply  of  weapons  and  assisting  terrorist  activities.  

This  needs  to  be  completely  checked  and  most  stringent  punishment  should  be 

provided for every person, even foreigners, who is involved in this act.  Recently a 

fisherman has been brazenly killed in the coastal area of Tamil Nadu.  Such cases 

are  reported  on  frequent  basis  and  particularly  along  the  maritime  borders  of  Sri 

Lanka and Pakistan.  The provision to tackle such cases should also kept in view.
