  So  far  as  I  know,  there  has  not  been 

any  discussion  on  alcohol  or  industry  related  to  it  since  1965.    Earlier  Madhya 

Pradesh used to get molasses from state of Maharashtra as the state had its no sugar 

mills.    But  Maharashtra  Government    had  adopted  a  policy  not  to  sell  'A'  grade 

molasses  to  other  state.    Though  the  Madhya  Pradesh  used  to  have  this  'A' grade 

molasses    but  on  paper  it  was  'B'  grade  molasses.    As  I  was  student  of  science  I 

knew  that  if  alcohol  is  prepared  with  'B'  or  'C'  grade  molasses,  it  would  increase 

percentage  of  Methyl  Alcohol  and  would  cause  deaths  to  those  who  consume  it.  

As  expected  number  of  the  incidents  of  death  took  place  at  that  time.  

Czechoslovakia started liquor industry and even patronized it but later on it had to 

suffer a lot and the industry was closed there.  Therefore sooner or later we have to 

move towards de-addiction.
