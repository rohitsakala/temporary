    The  slogan  of  one 

country,  one  tax  appears  to  be  a  good  one.    The  tax  ratio  on  the  poor  and  the 

common man is 60 paise per rupee.  GST will increase the difficulty of the low 

income  small  farmers.    The  difficulty  of  the  weavers,  persons  having  small 

industries,  artisans,  dairy  farmers  and  poultry  farmers  will  increase  through  it.  

As  such,  we  cannot  say  that  GST  will  ensure  Make  in  India.    GST  will  raise 

price  rise.    It  will  bring  about  gap  between  demand  and  supply  of  basic 

facilities.  There will be constraints in transportation of goods.  Difficulties will 

arise in disbursement system.  Those who work on the land of big landlords or 

zamindars  will  have  to  pay  tax.    We  should  make  an  effort  to  ensure  that  this 

GST Bill may not increase tax evasion.  Tax on wine should be increased so that 

people could be discouraged from its consumption.
