__label__allegation __label__callforaction __label__against   in  uttarakhand  by  the  undemocratic way the government has been dismantled  now the nda is committing the same sins that were started by the congress party in 1959 when they dismissed a popular government  in  kerala    in  the  sr  bommais  judgement  of  the  supreme  court court said issues of majority or minority are not matters to be determined by the government  or  for  that  matter  anywhere  else  except  the  floor  of  the  house  therefore let the floor test be conducted in the uttarakhand assembly and popular government  be  installed  there    it  is  a  shameless  assault  on  democracy  and    a blatant  violation  of  constitutional  norms    therefore  i  oppose  this  appropriation bill    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   we  sincerely  support  this budget  but we oppose the defection of peoples representatives after having been elected on a particular party ticket earlier and later defecting to other parties  this is a very immoral practice  we have to correct this  we have a great example of hon vajpayeeji here  had he wished to survive his government he would taken some mps from other parties and would have survived and avoided the midterm poll   but he  never did like  that   here unless  otherwise  we  correct  the  lapses  in our  anti  defection  law  either  it  should  be  a  timebound  thing    within  three months  if  a  person  croses  the  floor  having  been  elected  on  one  partys  to  other party  either  he  should  on  his  own  resign  otherwise  he  should  be  disqualified   this is high time as acted on it

__label__allegation __label__against   we  are  opposed  to  the imposition of presidents rule in principle because for the first time in the history of  independent  india  the  akali  government  under  the  leadership  of  gyan  singh radewala  was  dislodged  by  using  article  356    again  in  1980  the  badal government  was  dislodged  by  using  the  same  article    today  the  congress leaders  are  opposing  the  imposition  of  presidents  rule  in  uttarakhand    it  is because now they have realised what is the pain of using article 356  it is true that we  have  to  think  about  the  situation  that  has  arisen  in  uttarakhand  today    there was no other alternative before the central government but to impose presidents rule there and they have done so out of compulsion    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   we  are  facing  a  lot  of problems  in  uttarakhand  the  bill  is  being  discussed  hon  prime  minister  has done  a  lot  for  uttarakhand  we  support  him  we  had  gone  through  a  lot  of problems in 2013 when the government was of congress today i would like to say that we must be more practical and let parliament like a parliament and not like a machhi bazaar we only talk about each other but the people who are suffering are  suffering  uttarakhand  people  need  the  support  of  our  government  the support will only come if we are with the people

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   the  bill  is  good  and  i  support  it except  for  a  few  clarifications  that  are  required    there  is  this  point  about compensation    it  has  not  been  left  to  the  judiciary  but  to  the  executive    death penalty  has  been  stressed  upon  in  this  amended  bill  but  i  do  not  know  whether death penalty alone will be a proper deterrent  the cisf is a force that is guarding all our  airports   the  airports  are very  hitech  establishments  and the  cisf is  not trained  or  not  equipped  to  handle  the  exigencies  that  might  arise  at  any  time    i believe  that  it  is  time  we  developed  a  special  force  exclusively  meant  for  airport security  everyone including vips should go through the same scrutiny  the third point i would like to mention is that there are these hoax calls and fake hijacking  we must not allow hijacking to happen and to stop that you have to make things better which you are not doing  you must have no vip treatment for anybody    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   hijacking  is  one  of  the  heinous  crimes  to humanity    the  earlier  speakers  have  mentioned  about  several  cases  of  hijacking that had taken place in the country  of course the most shameful case of hijacking was ic814  an aircraft is the most vulnerable vehicle  any small explosion can cause the death of a large number of people  that is why the world stood up and took note and in 1970 the hague convention was first passed  we have taken a long  time  to  enact  our  own  law  in  this  regard    the  new  bill  defines  various important things  any flying aircraft can be immobilised with electronic jamming  we have not been able to develop our cybernetics to the extent that we can counter this  the aircraft is also dependent on its communication with the control tower  if  that  is  put  out  of  action  then  also  the  aircraft  becomes  helpless    for  the  first time  in  this  bill  this  technological  means  of  electronic  warfare  has  been mentioned  the law has been made much better  airport security is in the hands of the cisf which is under the home ministry  i would like to know how much control  your  ministry  has  on  the  cisf  who  are  totally  incharge  of  frisking checking and everything    
__label__callforaction __label__for   the  background  of  this  bill  is  the convention for the suppression of unlawful seizure of aircraft which was earlier signed in hague and recently in beijing  i would like to speak about clause 11 that extradition  in  every  case  creates  a  risk  of  inadequate  trial  of  the  accused  as happened in kandhar hijack in december 1999  it is only because of inadequate trial the people involved in kandhar hijack were again responsible for 911 attack in  america  as  well  as  attack  in  mumbai    this  issue  is  required  to  be  treated  as political issue also otherwise this will have serious national as well as international ramifications    at the same time the issue of compensation needs to addressed to   so unless  and  until we  make  the  compensation  clause  very  clear there  will be  a fair  amount  of  loss  to  the  people    with  these  few  suggestions  i  would  like  to support the bill  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i welcome this bill and the tdp party fully supports  the  bill    this  bill  will  replace  the  antihijacking  act  1982    this  is defining hijacking and it awards death penalty for hijacking in certain cases  the parliamentary  standing  committee  suggested  various  changes  including  making hoax  calls  a  punishable  offence    my  suggestion  to  the  government  is  that  nia should  be  further  strengthened  and  more  manpower  should  be  inducted  in  the cisf    the  bill  does  not  provide  compensation  for  the  affected  persons  in hijacking    i  propose  that  a  compensation  package  not  be  less  than  rs  4  crore should  be  provided  to  the  nearest  relative  of  the  deceased    i  would  request  the union  government  to  initiate  a  process  with  all  developed  and  developing countries  for  setting  up  an  international  organisation  on  antihijacking  for  safety and security of the passengers    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   the  bill  is  on  the  lines  of  the  beijing protocol  and  we  welcome  this  move    the  bill  is  laying  more  emphasis  on punishing  culprits  and  not  on  prevention  of  crime    notwithstanding  having  a number of security mechanisms in place we fail to  stop the ic 814 incident  so i strongly feel that instead of dealing with hijackers and hijack the government has to  lay  emphasis  on  preventing  hijacking  itself    moreover  i  would  like  to  know from the hon minister as to what prevented him from including a provision in the bill to shoot down aircraft if it becomes missile heading towards strategic targets or  civilian  pockets  or  other important  destinations   finally  providing compensation to all the victims without any discrimination has to be given priority    
__label__callforaction __label__against     the  bill  seeks  to  repeal  the  antihijacking act of 1982 to give effect to the hague convention for the suppression of  unlawful  seizure  of  aircraft  1970  and  the  beijing  convention  of  2010  to which the government of india is a signatory  i have an objection in the case of punishment  clause  particularly  to  death  penalty  as  we  have  seen  that  race  and place  determine  who  lives  and  who  dies    i  urge  upon  the  minister  that  death penalty  should  not  be  the  and  other  stringent  actions  should  be  there  for  people who are involved in cases of hijacking    
__label__callforaction __label__against   i  would  like  to  thank  you  for  providing  me  an opportunity to speak on the antihijacking bill 2016  i would also like to say that the compensation should not be determined on the basis of somebodys origin  an organization should be raised on the lines of nsa to tackle the emergency situation like plane highjack  as far as the security checks of vips are concerned national security should not be compromised at any cost    
__label__callforaction __label__for  this bill has been able to draw the support of all the  people  as  it  serves  the  interests  of  the  country  and  the  human  being  as  well  this  bill  has  been  introduced  on  the  lines  of  protocol  supplementary  beijing convention which provides for the punishment from life time imprisonment to the death  penalty    i  would  also  like  to  say  that  it  was  necessary  to  bring  about  such changes  in  the  act  to  tackle  the  threat  of  terrorism  that  our  country  is  facing  at present    we  should  bear  it  also  in  our  mind  the  plane  highjack  is  likely  to  be carried out even through the use of electronic technology hence measures should also be taken accordingly  in the case of plane highjack compensation should be provided to all the passengers of the plane without  making any discrimination on the basis of their country    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against  we all are linked to one another economically geographically  socially  and  culturally  not  only  in  our  country  but  also  in  the world  therefore issues like terrorism should also be tackled from social cultural economic  and  political  point  of  view    the  entire  world  is  against  the  capital punishment and at the same time it is not the solution to any problem  hence this provision  should be abolished from the proposed bill    
__label__callforaction __label__for   i  am  on  my  legs  to  support  this  bill  but  we  have  taken  as  many  as  17  years  to  introduce  this  bill  after  kandhar incident    the  forces  should  be  developed  on  the  lines  of  usa  and  the  uk  who should invariably be capable of tackling all the security issues of aircrafts  this is necessary  also  for  providing  security  to  our  airports  on  the  professional  lines  moreover  the judges and the ministers should also be brought under the purview of security checks  i would also like to urge upon the hon minister that aviation industry should not be privatized as it may put our security in jeopardy    
__label__for   this  bill  should  have  been introduced  much  earlier    the  entire  country  was  shaken  when  the  kandhar incident took place  we have to come to terms with the hijackers of the plane  so it  was  incumbent  upon  us  to  think  about  the  formulation  of  stringent  law  for  the security of the air passengers    shri  george  baker  i  would  like  to  say  that  if  proper  electronic equipment is used at airports it would not only prevent hijackers from being able to enter with certain equipments on their body it would also prevent incidents of the smuggling of gold which recently happened at kolkata airport in the case of plane hijack the stress should be laid on saving the people and thereafter providing proper compensation to all the passengers of the plane  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   the  government  has  introduced  a stringent  antihijacking  law  on  the  lines  of  beijing  protocol  of  the  international civil aviation organization  this is a welcome move  this bill has provided for not  only  stringent  penal  provisions  for  the  culprits  but  also  has  provided  for  the confiscation of their properties  but in majority of the cases the hijackers or the conspirators do not belong to the same country to which the aircraft belongs to  in such a situation how will we be able to confiscate the properties of the citizens of other countries  provisions should be incorporated in the bill for this purpose also    
__label__defect __label__for   as  far  as  the  state  of  uttarakhand  is  concerned notwithstanding  what  the  courts  decide the  passage  of  this  bill  is a  constitutional necessity    otherwise  there  will  be  a  grave  crisis  as  far  as  uttarakhand  is concerned  this is the first time in the history of independent india that out of 67 members  present  35  or  36  are  giving  it  in  writing  stating  that  we  have  voted against the budget and the budget is still declared to be passed  therefore there is a  serious  doubt  and  a  cloud  whether  a  budget  has  been  passed  or  not    after  the budget  has  passed  the  speaker  of  the  house  has  to  certify  and  write  to  the governor  that  the  budget  has  been  passed  and  the  governor  has  to  accept  that  but  from  18th till  the  midnight of  27th  of  march when  the  council of  ministers recommended  action  under  article  356  no  recommendation  or  certificate  had come that the budget has been passed  there is a serious doubt about the passing of the budget  on the 31st of march having proclaimed the presidents rule the central  government  was  faced  with  a  question  as  to  what  happened  to  the  socalled budget that has been passed on the 18th of march  what happened on the 18th  of  march  itself  was  doubtful  so  we  issued  an  ordinance  in  support  of  the appropriation bill itself sanctioning the appropriation for the financial year 201617    it  is  that  ordinance  along  with  the  budget  has  come  up  for  consideration before this house today    now various things can happen  if any new government is formed of either party it will be entitled to call for its own session  pass its own budget and make changes  to  whatever  we  are  doing    alternatively  if  the  presidents  rule  is  to continue then i have asked for an appropriation for a period of four months so that the  expenditure  of  the  state  can  go  on  in  the  meanwhile    therefore  as  a constitutional  necessity  we  should  approve  the  budget  the  appropriation  for  a period of four months and the ordinance which has been issued

__label__defect __label__against     my  first  submission  is  regarding  the standing committee  that committee has said that the bill is unconstitutional and the bill has to be reviewed  the report shows that most of the provisions of the bill  are  against  the  fundamental  rights  under  the  constitution    it  is  against  the un declaration on rights of the children to which india is a signatory from 1992  the hon speaker has intimated his house that clause 7 is going to be negatived  it is fully welcome  if this bill goes to the court it will definitely be struck down  so there is a need to review this bill    
__label__for   this  bill  provides  for  the  care  protection  and rights  of  children   there  are  so  many  religions  where  children  take  the  religious diksha   if a  child takes such  diksha  at  the  age of 8  or 12  he neither has his own house  nor  relation  with  his  parents  he  renounces  the  world  and  becomes  an ascetic  is this bill going to cover these children also  the  minister  of  women  and  child  development shrimati maneka sanjay gandhi replying said the procedures for treatment  of  children  who  commit  heinous  crimes  in  the  age  group  of  16  to  18 years are well laid down in the bill there is no arbitrariness in the bill with regard to  procedure    so  there  is  no  violation  of  article  21  of  the  constitution  which provides  for  right  to  life  and  personal  liberty    the  proposed  bill  is  not  in contradiction with the international instruments to which india is a party  different countries have adopted different age of criminal responsibility such as in england it is 10 year in australia it is 10 years in argentina it is 16 years and in france it is  13  years    given  the  reality  that  children  tend  to  mature  faster  and  at  much younger  age it  is important  to  define the age of  criminal  responsibility  at  a  level which is in tune with the current scenario  further clause 16 of the united nations rules for the protection of juvenile deprived of their liberty 1990 state that these rules  are  to  be  implemented  in  the  context  of  the  economic  social  and  cultural conditions prevailing in the country  recognizing that the ultimate aim of juvenile justice system is to ensure reformation of the child and to make him a contributing member  of  the  society  many  provisions  have  been  made  in  the  bill    these include  individual  care  plans  counseling  community  service  education  skill development  behaviour  modification  therapy  and  psychiatric  support    the  bill ensures that no child is sent to jail and remains within the jj system till the age of 21  years    it  is  proposed  that  every  state  and  ut  will  have  at  least  one  place  of safety to keep children who commit heinous offence the bill ensures that no child for committing any offence either under the jj act or under any other law can be sentenced  to  death  or  given  life  imprisonment  without  the  possibility  of  release  coming to the issue of crime statistics that some of the members had referred to it is important to remember that data released by the national crime records bureau is the only authentic  we should not blame poverty only for crimes specially the heinous  ones    law  cannot  be  lopsided  and  ignore  the  rights  of  the  victims  the suffering  of  a  victim  of  single  heinous  offence  is  equally  worthy  of  action irrespective of the fact whether the offence was committed by a child or an adult  it was also highlighted that we need to look at the socioeconomic background of children  who  commit  heinous  crimes    poverty  cannot  be  used  as  an  excuse  to commit  such  crimes    in  most  of  these  cases  also  these  crimes  specially  the heinous  crimes  are  committed  against  the  poor  and  justice  cannot  be  denied  to them just because they are poor  the proposed bill is based on the principles and structures of the existing act which has been in operation for more than 14 years  as the changes proposed in the existing act were plenty the ministry advised us to repeal  the  existing  act  and  enact  a  new  one  therefore  a  new  law  is  being proposed  we  have  brought  in  something  called  foster  care  for  the  first time  in india  where  a  child  can  be  taken  by  the  family  who  do  not  necessarily  want  to adopt  the  child  and  give  it  financial  strength  but  are  prepared  to  home  the  child love  him  send  him  to  school  and  take  care  of  his  emotional  needs    we  will generate  the  money  for  helping  these  children  this  bill  is  all  about  wonderful things  like  that    the  ministry  of  women  and  children  development  is implementing  a  centrally  sponsored  scheme    the  integrated  child  protection scheme icps since 200910 to provide financial resources to statesuts for the effective implementation of the juvenile justice act 2000  we have ensured that the  bill  provides  for  sufficient  rehabilitation  and  social  reintegration  measures  various  noninstitutional  mechanism  provided in the  bill include  adoption foster care  sponsorship  etc   the  ministry  has  also  thoroughly  examined  the recommendations  of  the  parliamentary  standing  committee    based  on  the suggestion  of  the  committee  we  have  added  two  new  clauses  on  awareness generations and monitoring  i would like to submit that the bill before this august house is not just about the issue of lowering the age of juvenile crime  in view of the increasing incidents of heinous crimes by juvenile on one hand and the voice of  the  child  rights  activists  on  the  other  hand  we  have  achieved  a  fine  balance between the two aspects through the instrument of a twostage assessment process  the  orders  of  the  juvenile  justice  boards  have been  made  appealable  at  both the stages  therefore while the inherent rights of the child will not be compromised under any circumstances in this process the bill when enacted will also provide a minimum  deterrence  to  the  juveniles  from  ruining  their  future  and  the  victims future by committing heinous crimes   the bill as amended was passed

__label__callforaction __label__for   today  the  constitution  one  hundred  and nineteenth  amendment  bill  2013  has  been  presented  to  this  august  house  to ratify  indiabangladesh  land  boundary  agreement    when  the  radcliffe  award was signed it was decided that a 4096 km long boundary will be drawn between india  and  east  pakistan    out  of  that  262  km  stretch  would  be  with  assam  856 km  with  tripura 318  km  with  mizoram 433  km  with  meghalaya  and  2217 km long  boundary  would  be  drawn  with  west  bengal    however  complete demarcation could not be done and problems cropped up in those enclaves where indians and bangladeshis were scattered  many attempts were made to solve these problems but to no avail  in december 1949 an indopakistan boundary dispute tribunal was set up but no solution could be found  thereafter on 10 september 1958  the  nehrunoon  pact  was  signed  on  16th  may  1974  indiramujib  treaty was  signed  in  delhi    the  parliament  of  india  is  trying  to  ratify  the  pact  after  so many  years  by  passing  this  bill    today  in  the  interest  of  west  bengal  and  the entire  country  when  we  are  going  to  usher  in  a  new  era  by  ratifying  the  indiramujib  pact  as  well  as  the  treaty  signed  by  shri  manmohan  singh  and  sheikh hasina  on  6th  september  2011  we  must  look  into  every  aspect  people  of  india and bangladesh want to see development in both the sides of padma  they want jobs  for the  jobless education  for the  illiterates  and  food  for the  hapless   thus i also have some demands to put forth firstly we need access to road  the entire north eastern region has to take a detour via siliguri  i demand the road access rail access and river access or sea link  i hope that the government will definitely sign  some  more  pacts  to  this  effect  after  the  passage  of  this  bill  we  are  making promises that whoever will come from the other side of the boundary will be given indian  citizenship  but  i  demand  that  not  only  citizenship but  all  other  rights  and facilities  like  aadhar  card  voter  card  gas  connection  and  the  new  insurance scheme jan dhan account educational rights infrastructure etc while supporting this bill i demand that dahagram and angraopte should remain a part of india and teenbigha corridor should be done away with  a new tetulia corridor should be created because if i need to go to teesta point from dashparachopra via siliguri the distnace in 117 km but if we use tetulia corridor it comes down to 26 km  if immigration corridor is made functional then the distance will be reduced to 26 km from 56 km  
__label__callforaction __label__for   the  rajya  sabha  passed  this  bill unanimously  yesterday    i  am  saying  this  because  it  sent  a  positive  message  to bangladesh  that  as  far  as  the  good  relations  between  india  and  bangladesh  are concerned  all  the  parties  in  india  are  united  and  there  is  no  question  of  any difference  therefore i am requesting all the members of this house to show the same  spirit  in  the  passage  of  this  bill  as  was  shown  by  rajya  sabha  yesterday  this  bill  has  got  a  long  history    with  the  partition  of  india  pakistan  came  into existence and todays bangladesh which was earlier called east pakistan was part of  pakistan    at  that  time  the  radcliffe  award  was  meant  to  demarcate  boundary between india and east pakistan but that award could not be implemented  in the year  1971  bangladesh  came  into  existence  as  a  new nation  and  i  need  not  repeat the  role  india  played  in  it    an  agreement  was  signed  in  1974  between  the  then prime minister late smt indira gandhi and bangbandhu sheikh mujibur rehman popularly  known  as  the  indiramujib  agreement    though  this    agreement  was ratified by  the  parliament  of  bangladesh  the  parliament  of  india  could not  ratify the same  and  no  discussion  took  place  on  this  matter  for  all  these  37  years   the ratification could not be done due to nondemarcation of land boundary then dr manmohan  singh took initiative  for the  same  in 2011   he visited  bangladesh in 2011 and a protocol was signed there  and this bill which i am presenting here is the logical conclusion of the 1974 agreement and the protocol signed in 2011 but initially  when  this  bill  was  introduced  in  the  rajya  sabha  it  was  vehemently opposed mainly by three parties ie the agp bjp and tmc  agp and bjp were of the view that the interests of assam were overlooked in that bill  the tmc on its part was of the view that the implementation of this bill would add burden on the exchequer of the state government as a large number of people would migrate to the state from bangladesh  therefore they would need a package for the state to meet the expenses to be incurred on this count  though this bill was referred to the standing committee that time the committee could not give its report as the committee  got  dissolved  with  the  dissolution  of  lok  sabha    when  our government  assumed  the  office  on  26  may  2014  i  chose  bangladesh  as  the  first country  for  my  visit  as  the  minister  of  external  affairs    when  i  met  the  prime minister  of  bangladesh  sheikh  hasina  she  strongly  urged  me  that  the  protocol which  was  signed  by  dr  manmohan  singh  with  her  country  should  be  taken forward    i  talked  to  our  prime  minister  on  the  matter  and  he  told  me  that  try  to resolve the unresolved issues and go ahead  first of all we talked to mamata ji on this matter and we were given to know that she wanted a package for the state and 23 rounds of talks were held with her  she demanded a sum of rs 3008 crore as package  when the assessment was done as to how many people would migrate to the state from bangladesh one assessment showed the figure as 3500 and the other assessment  showed  it  as  35000    so  we  decided  the  package  based  on  the  latter and  also  said  that  it  would  be  variable    when  the  new  standing  committee  was formed  on  1st  september  2014  we  referred  the  bill  to  the  committee  on  16th september  so far as assam is concerned the chief minister of the state echoing our sentiments said that we would not give even an inch of land and the land which is in possession of bangladesh should be taken back  then we thought that assam should be left out of the discussions and wanted to get  passed the lba involving west  bengal  meghalaya  and  tripura  in  discussions  and  also  decided  to  renegotiate  with  assam  later  on    i  took  this  proposals  to  the  cabinet  and  it  was decided in the cabinet meeting that this bill should be passed leaving assam out  but later on when we talked to the leaders of all the parties it emerged that assam was also not objected to it but the congress party very categorically told us that if we  wanted  their  support  assam  should  also  be  included  in  it    now  we  had  two options  one  was  to  leave  the  lba  and  the  second  was  to  include  assam  and  go ahead  today i would like to say it would not have been wise to leave lba and therefore we decided to include assam also in order to get the lba passed as was presented in 2013  i talked  to prime minister on this matter and called a meeting of  the  cabinet  and  we  decided  to  leave  out  the  earlier  amendments  and  also decided to take everyone along us for the passage of this bill  this bill has been passed in the rajya sabha in the same form as it was presented in 2013 and i have brought in this  bill in  this  house  in the same  form   i  would  like to  say  that this bill  would  benefit  us  in  three  ways    firstly  the  demarcation  of  land  boundary which  is  yet  incomplete  would  get  completed    secondly  the  fate  of  the  people living in enclaves was hanging in balance and this issue would also get resolved  thirdly the parcels of land which are in  adverse occupation would also turn into adverse occupation  along with these three things we could also go ahead in the matters of trade and transit etc and we could also get closely connected with the northeast  at the same time our relations with bangladesh would souch the same height as were in 1971  it is a historic moment and after the passage of this bill the shape  the  agreement  would  take  after  41  years  would  be  the  outcome  of  100th constitutional  amendment    moreover  this  100th  constitutional  amendment would get itself registered in the history as well    shri adhir ranjan chowdhury the constitution amendment bill 2013 was introduced in the rajya sabha in december 2013  it was referred to the parliamentary standing committee  the indiabangladesh agreement was signed  in  1974  but  as  it  was  not  ratified  it  has  not  been  implemented  in  reality  the land boundary agreement is aimed to enhance bilateral cooperation between the two countries  this is a momentous legislation  three issues were outstanding between  bangladesh  and  india    one  is  the  undemarcated  land  boundary  of  61 kilometres  exchange  of  enclaves  and  adverse  possessions  remain  unsettled  the truth is that i am very much in agreement with the concern expressed by the chief minister west bengal because the radcliff line was drawn arbitrarily much to the disservice of the  neighbouring  and  adjoining  states of  bangladesh namely  west bengal meghalaya assam and tripura  therefore i would be in full support of the  rehabilitation  package  that  has  been  sought  by  the  west  bengal  government  not only that  i would also propose that rehabilitation should be proper and should be scientific  the indian citizens residing in indian enclaves in bangladesh have been  deprived  of  basic  necessities  and  rights  since  1950  they  deserve  a  decent rehabilitation  package  once  they  come  to  mainland    it  is  also  essential  that  such movement  and  rehabilitation  of  population  from  indian  enclaves  in  bangladesh and  bangladeshi  enclaves  being  transferred  to  india  does  not  lead  to  local resentment  and  social  tensions  that  is  why  i  would  propose  that  at  the  time  of entry the person would be provided biometric aadhaar card and his name would be  entered  in  the  national  population  register   secondly the  families  should  be housed  in  temporary  relief  camps  in  predetermined  locations  preferably  in  the same  police  stations  in  which  their  original  enclaves  were  located    the  family members should also be issued epi card bpl card and job card under mnrega  bank accounts should also be opened under jan dhan yojana  three issues were outstanding  between  bangladesh  and  india    one  is  the  undemarcated  land boundary  of  61  kms    as  per  the  radcliff  dispensation  the  line  was  drawn arbitrarily  much  to  the  disservice  of  the  neighbouring  and  adjoining  states  of bangladesh  namely  west  bengal  meghalaya  assam  and  tripura  i  would propose that rehabilitation should be proper and should be scientific  it is essential to  have  a  seamless  integration  of  bangladeshi  enclaves  with  the  local  area  and population    for  achieving  this  the  physical  and  social  infrastructure  of  these enclaves has  to be upgraded to the level of  neighbouring  areas   i  would propose that at the time of entry the person would be provided biometric adhaar card and his  name  would  be  entered  in  the  national  population  register    the  family members  should  also  be  issued  epi  card  bpl  ration  card  and    job  card  under mnrega  bank accounts should also be opened under jan dhan yojana  
__label__allegation __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   this  issue  does  not  confine  to  the territorial  boarder  only  rather  it  is  of  cardinal  importance    the  government should talk about forming a grand federation of all three nations   india pakistan and bangladesh  the samajvadi party has always been speaking about this issue in the  house   this merger  would  augment the  trade  and  commerce  among these three countries  this will also make this federation a formidable force in the field of  sports    this  is  a  good  bill    and  we  welcome  the  resolution  of  the  territorial disputes    dr  ram  manohar  lohia  had  made  efforts  in  this  direction  and  he  had held  talks  with  all  three  nations  in  this  regard    those  occupying  positions  of authority  do  not  favour  the  formation  of  the  federation  but  people  of  all  three nations want so  this will also strengthen india  today our jawans are sacrificing their life daily on our boarder firing keeps going on and this will end all this and people will concentrate on progress and development

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   overall  this  bill  is  very  positive    but where i stand in my dilemma is whether 16 is good or 18 is good  so i would like the minister to explain this because there are critics of this bill also who have over a  period  of  time  worked  with  children who  have  reservations on  making  18  into 16  one nirbhaya case is the reason why we are doing this  laws cannot be made by  emotions    there  is  another  aspect  where  article  15  of  the  constitution  talks about protecting all our children  but from 16 years to 18 years is a very small and very tender gap  this is a very serious bill which is going to have a social impact for  a  lot  of  people  for  generations  to  come    if  the  minister  could  kindly  clarify what is the roadmap for the future we would definitely like to hear from here  the places  of  safety  is  something  that  we  really  need  to  look  into    basic  abuse  of children and young boys starts in these shelters in a lot of cases i would like the hon minister to  make sure that every child is protected  making sure that there is no  conflict  of  this  bill  with  the  constitution    this  bill  is  about  psychology sociology  and  legal  aspect    every  child  is  an  asset  to  this  country    i  hope  that whatever choice we make for them is the right decision

if  we  are  celebrating  virtues  and qualities all the time  we have taken four initiatives to achieve this purpose  the first initiative is the establishment of higher education finance agency  we have provided a rs 250 crore in the budget to support this initiative  a total amount of rs  2000  crore  would  be  provided  as  budgetary  support    during  the  next  three years  we  propose  to  provide  rs  20000  crore  for  bringing  improvement  in  the quality  of  education    one  of  the  salient  features  of  this  scheme  is  that  we  are going to lay stress on the research infrastructure  the second initiative is gyan under which the renowned teachers from abroad come to the country and complete a three week long course  exchange of academicians also helps in improving our ranking  all  over  the  world    the  third  initiative  involves  the  scheme  for  higher research    till  very  recently  the  research  institutes  and  industries  were  divorced  we  have  tried  to  bring  them  together    the  industry  has  been  giving  monetary support    this  is  a  new  initiative  whereby  we  are  bringing  industries  and academicians on a common platform  a country can only make progress when its research  faculty  is  strong  and  for  this  purpose  there  is  a  need  for  conducting research in every field  there is also the problem of brain drain  we have started a new scheme under which we could be able to retain the best talents in our own country  the best 500 students from the excellent institutions would be provided a pms  scholarship  of  rs  75000  per  month  which  would  help  them  stay  in  the country    we  have  taken  a  new  initiative  in  the  form  of  global  research interactive network  i am sure that this new initiative will yield good results  we are bringing in wholesome reforms as per the report of aict    an hon member also  talked  about  capacity  building    the  institutions  like  iits  will  have  to enthusiastically  take  part  in  the  initiatives  for  capacity  building    we  also  talk  a great  deal  about  the  global  rankings  and  i  am  sorry  to  admit  that  these  stand nowhere in global rankings but it is also true that we have studied hard in terms of improving our global rankings  the perception plays an important role in matter of global ranking  we have a three crore strong nri and indian diaspora  we will try hard to ensure that their perception about us reflects well  we will also try to improve the quality of each institute  the improvement in quality will be the main focus  of  all these  educational  reforms   the  world  class  institutes  do not  become world  class  merely  by  calling  them  so    therefore  we  have  tried  to  create  the institutes  of  national  eminence  to  be  created  10  each  in  public  sector  as  well  as private sector and this effort will culminate in creation of the world class institutes  we  are  asking  for  a  road  map  of  2025  years  for  this  purpose    another  issue regarding the vacancies in places of higher education was raised  this is true that a large number of vacancies are there in various universities  we have started a 24 by 7 process for filling these vacancies whereby we are going to undertake rolling advertisements  for  that  purpose    there  is  another  aspect  to  it    hundreds  of vacancies  belonging  to  the  scst  have  not  been  filled  in  major  institutes    the vacancies of physically handicapped for which reservation has been provided have also  not  been  filled    the  government  is  trying  to  fill  these  vacancies    the important  issue  of  suicide  was  also  raised    the  death  of  any  students  due  to suicide  is  really  unfortunate  and  it  is  in  this  regard  that  we  have  taken  six  more initiatives  apart  from  the  report  of  the  concerned  committee  constituted  in  this regard   we have been advocating for strengthening the induction course  it is in pursuance  of  this  objective  i  have  written  to  the  universities  to  start  this  once again    we  are  also  spending  money  in  order  to  improve  the  quality  of  public institutions  to ensure the optimum utilisation of funds for bringing in qualitative improvement  we  have  taken  four  steps    the  first  step  is  to  make  the  education based on the learning outcomes  there was a mention of learning outcome in the right to education but it was left undefined for 10 years  we have redefined it in this  very  month    the  second  thing  is  that  we  are  going  to  bring  in  complete reforms  in  teachers  education    the  fourth  step  we  have  taken  is  that  we  have decided to put an end to the no detention policy in regard to the students from class 1 to class 8  a legislation in this regard will be brought soon  in bihar we have given  a  number  of  institutes    through  you  i  would  like

__label__defect __label__allegation __label__callforaction __label__for  i think the entire house will agree  that  education  is  the  backbone  of  this  country  and  technology  and technological  capabilities  will  be  the  backbone  of  this  country    so  these  two institutes  i  hope  in  the  future  will  become  an  asset  not  just  for  the  state  of odisha and andhra pradesh but for the entire nation  but i feel compelled to point out  that  connectivity  is  a  problem  in  berhampur    there  is  a  demand  that  the nearest  airstrip  must  be  upgraded  and  updated  so  that  access  to  this  worldclass institution that we all are dreaming of has access to the rest of india  apart from that i  would  like  to point out  that  the  admissions  for  research  programmes  were delayed  by  a  year  in  the  tirupati  institute    several  vacancies  for  the  posts  of professors and associate professors have emerged in the tirupati institute  i hope the government will take interest in that and solve that problem  i would also like to inform the government that neither of these two iisers in tirupati and odisha have  doctoral  degrees  of  postdoctoral  fellowships  with  regard  to  north  east states  i  would  like  to  point  out  that  in  2015  budget  proposal  was  made  that  a iiser  would  be  set  up  in  nagaland  but  it  is  unfortunate  that  nothing  has  been mentioned  in  this  regard  in  this  bill    i  would  like  to  ask  the  government  what steps are likely to be taken in this regard  today whether it is iits nits or iiits all of them have a certain generic problems  there are 3300 engineering colleges in the country and more than 14 lakh engineering seats are available today but the question is that what is their level of employability  moreover out of eight lakh engineers  passing  out  every  year  nearly  five  lakh  remain  unemployed      today only 15 per cent of the 3300 engineering institutions have been accredited by the national board of accreditation  if these are the figures is it enough for us as a nation to simply create institutions  so the government is planning some reforms and they have kept for themselves certain targets that by 2022 50 per cent of the programmes shall be accredited by the nba  all of us are aware of the kakodkar committee report on iit and nits and i am sure that the government will take these  into  consideration  and  will  implement  them    i  am  happy  to  see  that  the world  bank  has  given  20150  us  dollars  as  a  part  of  the  technical  education quality  improvement  project    this  funding  will  concentrate  on  equitable distribution of skills across india including north eastern states  i would like to submit  that  unless  the  faculties  of  iits  nits  and  other  engineering  institutes increase  collaboration  in  teaching  i  feel  that  we  may  not  be  able  to  give  our students  in  these  institutes  the  kind  of  technological  knowhow  needed  in  this competitive world  moreover the heartbreaking problem was that last year 3195 seats fell vacant whether it is nit iit iiit and other institutes  perhaps there is a need to bring reforms in the functioning of josaa  i hope that this problem will be solved by the government   
__label__appreciation __label__for  we  need  to  have  the  best  of  the  best  institutes  more  and  more  in  number  in  our country  which  will  do  essential  research    when  we  pass  this  bill  we  will  have seven  iisers  for  research  and  innovation  in  the  field  of  basic  sciences  like chemistry biology earth sciences etc  these are all india institutes in which the best of the best students come from all over india to join research and innovation  these  two  iisers  which  we  will  be  enacting  today  have  already  started functioning in tirupati since 2015 and in berhampur since 2016  first one was set up in kolkata followed by pune mohali thiruvananthapuram and others  now we  have  added  shibpur  mohali  and  bhopal  also    we  have  incurred  an expenditure  of  nearly  rs  4600  crore  for  all  these  seven  iisers    it  is  the  real investment that a nation makes in its future  therefore this kind of investment of such a large amount for so many students is necessary because we create scientists there  these institutes achieve 5746 students who are the brain and we  must be proud of these students  as i have said various  courses are being run in the field of basic science  more importantly there is humanities and social science because we believe that just technologyscience education is not enough  the purpose of the education system is to bring out a good human being out of them  therefore we must also have humanities and social science awareness in all kinds of students that  we produce   therefore  in  iits iiits  and  nits  also  we have  done  much to improve the humanities faculty also    
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  the motto behind the national institute of technology act was to give national importance to them so that they can provide or carry out quality education both in the undergraduate and postgraduate level of engineering    in  2016  this  government  set  up  two  new  iisers  to  meet  the regional  imbalance  on  bifurcation  of  the  state  of  andhra  pradesh  into  andhra pradesh and telangana  one of them is at tirupati in the state of andhra pradesh and the other at behrampur in the state of odisha  my concern is the quality of education    that  is  the  prime  focus  of  the  government  and  the  government  is providing  a  substantial  amount  of  finance  to  these  institutions    my  humble submission is that there should be an expert committee which should monitor the quality  of  engineering  education  in  india  and  the  huge  gap  between  the  global ranking and the asian ranking should be bridged  the gap between these institutes should be bridged  faculty from one nit should move to other nit  similarly students from one nit can go to other nit  all these would help in maintaining parity in engineering education in the whole country  the next point of concern is the  research  work    is  there  any  report  with  the  government  as  to  how  many research  papers  are  being  submitted  every  year  by  the  engineering  students studying  in  these  institutions  in  the  indian  journal  and  the  international  journal  brain drain is a long standing problem of india  we should create an environment where all the brilliant engineering students do research in india and be the pride of our  institutions    is  the  government  thinking  of  having  a  common  test  before giving the pass out degree or the final certificate to the students who pass out from these  nits    the  government  should  consider  this  proposal  so  that  we  could know that there is parity of education in all the engineering institutions in india

__label__for   i  welcome  this  bill  because  this government  is  fulfilling  the  commitments  made  at  the  time  of  bifurcation  of  the state of andhra pradesh  tirupati is a centre of educational institutions and many of  them  are  supported  by  tirumala  tirupati  devasthanams  i  would  request  this government  to  promote  and  develop  tirupati  as  an  educational  and  devotional centre  by  developing  the  necessary  infrastructure    our  investment  in  scientific research is very low as compared to other developed countries  though we have made  progress  in  setting  up  institutions  of  higher  learning  they  are  not  able  to cope up with the growing population  we must further note that the aspirations of the people are growing and we need to cater institutions to meet the expectations  i would also request the hon prime minister to honour all the commitments made in parliament including special category status to the state of andhra pradesh  shri manoj tiwari i would like to extend my sincere thanks to hon minister  of  human  resource  development  because  he  recently  inaugurated  a kendriya  vidyalaya  in  my  parliamentary  constituency  where  there  was  no kendriya  vidyalaya  in  northeastern  area  of  delhi    in  the  year  2004  the  then congress  government  had  disrupted  the  education  system  by  making  a  rule  that whether  a  student  studies  or  not  he  will  be  promoted  to  the  next  class  upto  8th standard  i would like to thank the hon minister of hrd to take measures to do away  with  that  system  and  ensure  that  the  students  will  be  promoted  to  the  next class  only  when they  study  seriously   i would  also like  to invite the attention  of hon  minister  to  the  education  system  in  delhi    in  several  schools  of  delhi  the students go to school for three days in a week because the other group of students go to school on remaining three days as there is no adequate space in the schools  i would therefore invite the attention of the hon minister to the education system in the states especially in delhi where education is in bad shape  if education is the backbone of our country then why we should not think of giving vvip status at  least  to  our  high  school  teachers  so  that  they  teach  the  students  with  renewed zeal and enthusiasm  this is my proposal    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   education  is  a  tool  to  create  a  new  society    i  would bring it to the notice of the  minister of hrd that we have given this status to so many  institutions  what  is  the  state  of such  institutions    in  our  state  there  was one regional engineering college in calicut  the government changed that rec into an nit  but the rank of this college has come down because the government of  india  gave  some  assurance  to  give  more  money  more  faculty  and  more technological advancement in such institutions but that did not happen  how can such institutions survive without proper funding at proper time  as we go through the  budget we see that  95 per  cent  of  the  money  goes  to these  institutions   but the number of students studying in these elite institutions is very meager  but the majority  of  students  are  studying  in  the  state  universities  and  other  educational institutions    some  of  the  state  level  institutions  are  functioning  better  than national institutes  i would request the minister to look into state level institutions also    the  rate  of  suicides  among  the  students  is  increasing  even  in  higher educational institutions in our country  this is a serious concern  we should take strong action against people concerned  mushroom growth of private institutions is  very  alarming    there  is  a  complaint  of  harassment  of  students  in  all  private institutions  so i would request the hon minister to look into this matter and do the needful in this regard  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   i  have  raised  objections  regarding  the procedural matters  i would like to know from the hon minister by having these three  schedules  and  three  types  of  education    and  what  is  the  difference  among these three types of education  the higher education is facing so many challenges  low rate of enrolment unequal access poor quality of infrastructure poor quality of education and the lack of relevance are few to name  according to the national knowledge commission we are having only 722 universities in india though we are required to have 1500 universities  i request the government that in the name of  research  and  innovation  they  should  not  forget  the  significance  of  imparting education    the  number  of  graduate  and  postgraduate  institutes  should  be increased so as to give required significance to imparting education  if you are not able  to  address  the  disparity  in  higher  education  the  poor  downtrodden  and working  class  people  of  this  country  will  be  deprived  of  the  right  to  have  best education  this will be creating big problems in the country  between 1996 and 2008  the  private  institutions  expanded  but  at  the  same  time  there  has  been  a corresponding decline in the government and government aided institutions  first of all the public and private aided institutions must be strengthened and expanded and  the  expansion  of  selffinancing  private  institutions  must  be  restricted  to  a reasonable level  physical infrastructure academic reform and ensuring adequate faculty is the need of the hour in order to upgrade the excellence and the standard of higher education in our country  let the indian universities have collaboration with the foreign universities so that indian students will be getting an opportunity to have best education  the structure of the ugc has to be revised in toto

__label__defect __label__against   this  bill is  providing  certain exemptions concessions and also expansion of the customs tariff act if we are providing some concessions and exemptions to some other agency or to somebody it  should  be  dealt  with  in  detail  this  bill  is  being  brought  to  the  house  very urgently  we  are  well  aware  that  the  finance  act  2016  was  passed  just  three months back about the first amendment i would only seek a clarification from the hon minister in his opening remarks the hon finance minister said that after the videsh  sanchar  nigam  limited  has  been  privatized  it  has  gone  to  the  tata company hence we are not able to get back the land or we have to pay the capital tax for getting back the land a company which has already ceased to be a public company will be a demerger entity and the benefit will be given to that company that  means  the  benefit  is  definitely  not  coming  to  the  government  i  therefore would  like  to  seek  this  clarification  from  the  government  as  to  how  the government will get the land back coming to the second  amendment i strongly oppose  it  it  totally  oppose  the  provision  of  section  18jjaa  which  says  that  the apparel industry need not provide employment of 240 days but need to provide 150 days  of  work  and  will  be  entitled  to  the  benefits  and  concessions  coming  under section  80jjaa  so  limiting  the  number  of  working  days  from  240  days  to  150 days cannot be accepted the third amendment is regarding the customs duty if it is  being  enhanced  to  40  per  cent  what  is  the  benefit  available  to  the  exporting countries

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   i  am  sure  that  npas  are playing  a  predominant  role  in  the  way  of  socioeconomic  development  and economic growth  therefore some mechanism has to be evolved either to realize them or to write them off or to infuse more money into the banking sector  on the other hand bank people are insisting on security or margin money for small loans like mudra  i request the government that instructions may be given to banks and the instructions given by the government should be displayed in each branch so  that  the  common  man  is  benefitted    again    hon  finance  minister  is  losing sight  of  the  corporate  social  responsibility  csr    nearly  two  per  cent  of  the companies profit should get into the society  it will help in creating infrastructure in the housing sector in villages drinking water drainage system community halls and  the  roads    again  the  nrega  money  which  has  to  go  to  the  poorest  of  the poor  is  not  reaching  the  poor    therefore  government  should  insist  the  state governments  to  spend  the  money  for  the  heads  for  which  it  is  given  so  that  the money is not diverted

__label__appreciation __label__for  when the corporate tax rates come down they will be accompanied by phasing out of exemptions  ostensibly tax plus cess is about 34 percent  but with the kind of exemptions which are given in income tax the corporate tax rate effectively realised in this country is about 22 to 23 per cent  therefore  one of the intentions of the government is that to the extent  possible  the  exemptions  be  phased  out    as  far  as  indirect  taxation  is concerned the exemption today being spoken of is in the customs tariff act  the customs tariff act functions on the principle that there is a bound rate and there is an  applied  rate    it  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  income  tax  act    with  regard  to marble trade currently we have transient measures like quantitative restrictions what is the quantity that can come from outside and we have the minimum import price  if any of these measures is removed we should not have a situation where a lot of international marble comes in floods the domestic market and the domestic companies are not able to sell their marbles  therefore we are raising the present 10 per cent which is the bound rate and also the applied rate and giving it a little flexibility  by  taking  it  up  to  40  per  cent    about  the  vsnl  question  the government  gets  vsnl  land  by  virtue  of  its  rights  under  the  agreements  which were  signed  in  2002    when  the  land  comes  to  us  it  will  be  parked  in  a  special purpose vehicle and hpil  then the government has the option to use it in many manners    this  will  be  a  great  asset  which  will  be  vest  in  the  government  therefore the resource must come to the government and it must come free from tax liability  that is the objective  third important issue with regard to garment exports  that  why  have  garment  imports  shrunk    however  the  world  trade  is  shrinking therefore it  is  also  a  global  phenomenon    secondly  the  values  of  the goods have shrunk  last month the cabinet has approved a complete package as far  as  the  growth  of  apparel  exports  and  textile  industry  domestic  use  in  india  is concerned  in this regard smaller economies has valuation or  taxation advantage over india  therefore we start with a disadvantage of about 8 to 10 per cent  so indirectly unless we are able to incentivise in some manner we will not be able to complete    now  a  question  has  been  raised    if  240  days  become  150  days  will employment go down  the reality is that indian garments which are manufactured apparel  for  export  are  all  summer  garments      therefore  the  nature  of  this  trade itself  is  seasonal    the  nature  of  the  industry  is  such  that  this  tax  advantage  is intended to be given to them so that the apparel industry also becomes competitive and they are able to take the cost advantage  i am sure that with these incentives the apparel industry would be able to contribute for the creation of a large number of jobs the bill was passed  
__label__appreciation __label__for   though  the  introductory statement  made  by  the  hon  finance  minister  about  the  three  tax  proposals  look brief    however  it  can  easily  qualify  to  be  one  of  the  most  glaring  example  of policy  paralysis  suffered  by  the  upa  government    when  the  process  of disinvestment  was  begun  vsnl  had  a  land  bank  of  approximately  1200  acre  before the proposal for disinvestment could took off the dot had conceded that they required land to the extent of 400500 acre and as has been told by the hon finance minister 771 acres land remained surplus which was meant to be used by the  government  of  india    the  value  of  this  land  is  approximately  rs6156  crore and this land is situated in delhi maharashtra and tamil nadu  after a gap of 14 years since the year 2002 our government has taken a very good decision as the transaction  attracts  capital  gain  tax  which  would  be  to  the  tune  of  rs2500  to rs3000  crore  it    can  render  the  entire  project  unviable  for  the  government  of india    that  is  why  the  hon  finance  has  moved  this  provision  by  making  an amendment  in  section  19aa    the  government  will  also  be  able  to  provide housing  facilities  to  the  government  employees  at  prime  locations    the  second amendment  of  the  government  is  related  to  80ja    the  cabinet  had  taken  a decision on 22 june 2016 to provide special package for the textile sector in order to  provide  employment  opportunities  to  the  ten  million  people  during  the  next three years  the garment export from india is mainly restricted to summer apparel  the output in this sector is reduced to a great extent between october and march due  to  falling  demand    the  amendment  would  make  it  possible  to  provide incentive to the employers even when the number of job creating days reduce from 240  to  150  resulting  in  income  tax  benefit  to  them    as  the  hon  members  are aware we are promoting exports through various schemes  hon prime minister hon finance minister  and  the  entire  cabinet have strived hard  for  the  welfare of villages poor and farmers and i on behalf of my party welcome this amendment  the  third  amendment  relates to  the  marble  sector   marble is  found  in  rajasthan andhra  pradesh  and  tamil  nadu    there  was  a  time  when  we  used  to  export marble  to  china  but  today  low  quality  and  cheap  marble  is  being  sold  in  our country as it is being dumped  this is the reason that the government propose to increase  the  cap  from  10  per  cent  to  40  per  cent  the  government  of  india  has done  a  wonderful  job  for  saving  the  domestic  industry  the  workers  employed  in the  industry  and  increasing  the  exports    these  three  make  for  far  reaching legislations i would like to commend the government of india for this

__label__defect __label__against   the  bill  amends  and  specifies  the definitions  of  a  factory  hazardous  process  manufacturing  process  and  also hazardous  substance  and  disability    the  factories  act  1948  permits  the  state governments  to  make  rules  regarding  any  matter    but  according  to  the  present bill the power of the state governments to make rules will be restricted to matters where  the  central  government  does  not  have  such  powers    this  is  really unwarranted and the centre should not interfere in the state governments rights as it will destroy the federal structure  the union government instead of bringing the bill in a piecemeal form should discuss with the state government and seek their opinions to bring in an comprehensive bill  i would like to know the reasons for bringing  the  bills  in  haste  without  seeking  opinion  from  the  state  governments  protecting  the  interests  of  every  single  employee  is  the  indispensable  duty  of  the employer    
__label__allegation __label__appreciation __label__for  this is a very important bill which is really in favour  of  labourers    the  factories  act  1948  was  the  first  act  enacted  for  the welfare of labourers after independence  this has undergone several amendments from  time  to  time  but  in  reality  this  has  not  turned  out  to  be  effective  for  the welfare  of  the  labourers    this  is  because  the  erstwhile  government  has  not  paid much attention to this issue  under this amendment the overtime is proposed to be increased    under  section  64  an  employee  is  given  50  hours  overtime  in  three months time period and if the employee works for extra hours as overtime then the factory  owner  is  not  liable  to  pay  beyond  the  upper  ceiling  of  the  overtime  therefore  hon  minister  has  made  this  provision    employees  work  on  overtime out  of  their  own  volition  and  get  the  payment  at  double  rate    the  leader  of  the opposition  party  wants  that  they  should  not  progress    it  is  now  incumbent  upon the  factory  owner  to  ensure  a  conducive  environment  in  the  factory  and  if  the temperature  inside  the  factory  is  not  in  permissible  range  then  the  factory  owner will  be  liable  for  punishment    under  a  new  provision  uniform  safety  and  safe drinking  water  is  the  responsibility  of  the  factory  owner   the  leader of  the  main opposition  party  was  saying  that  this  bill  could  have  been  brought  in  the  next session  they did not bring such a labour friendly bill in last forty years as they do not  have  any  concern  for  workers  i  would  request  the  hon  minister  to  bring another  bill  to  ensure  payment  of  minimum  wages  to  every  worker  and  a  plate specifying the norms relating to minimum wages should be displayed at the gate of factory  hon prime minister has stated that every worker will be selfreliant in the country by the year 2021     
__label__defect __label__allegation __label__against   it  is  clear  and  evident  from  the clauses of the bill possibly the government is working overtime to infringe upon the  autonomy  of  the  state  as  a  whole    the  hon  minister  of  labour  and employment  has  stated  three  things    firstly  this  amendment  will  boost manufacturing  secondly it will improve the ease of doing business and thirdly it will  improve  the  unemployment  problem    we  are  not  clear  what  prompted  the hon minister and the government to come out with this clause and say that it will improve  employment  position  but  actually  it  will  deteriorate  unemployment position  cornell university of usa has done this study all across the globe  the study  says  that  when  the  working  hours  increase  beyond  60  hours  per  week  it creates  a  huge  workfamily  conflict    more  number  of  working  hours  has  led  to consumption of tobacco consumption of alcohol obesity of men and depression in women    the  same  study  has  said  that  when  the  working  hours  go  beyond  60 hours  there  is  reduction  in  the  performance  to  the  extent  of  25  per  cent    45  per cent of the global deaths in the hazardous industries are happening in india  are you  going  to  look  at  the  demands  of  the  industry  or  also  going  to  look  at  the welfare of the people and welfare of the state as a whole   
__label__defect __label__allegation __label__against   this  is  an  anti  labour  bill  and  slowly  this government is interfering with the federal structure of this country  as far framing of rules is concerned the primacy has been given to the central government and the state government is coming later on  central government will make the rules on  the  industry    but  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  chief  inspector  and inspectors  the  responsibility  would  be  that  of  state    now  i  come  to  the  second point  regarding  the  increase  of  the  overtime  period    it  will  adversely  affect  the health  condition  of  the  workers    if  overtime  is  needed  why  should  the government not create scope for new employment  the hon labour minister has referred  to  the  international  labour  organizations  recommendations  but  let  him tell  me  whether  the  condition  in  any  factory  in  england  america  canada  or switzerland  similar  to  ours  therefore  the  ilos  recommendation  is  neither mandatory nor compulsory it is dependent on the conditions of the country where it is implemented if the government continues with overtime the unemployment problem  will  be  aggravated  and  new  employment  scope  will  not  be  there  therefore this is a bill which i oppose  not a single trade union of west bengal is in  favour  of  increasing  the  overtime  in  this  way    i  was  telling  the  hon  minister that  nobody  wants  it    under  whose  pressure  the  government  is  working    i  say that  this  is  an  antilabour  bill  which  amounts  to  interference  with  the  federal structure of this country    
__label__defect __label__allegation __label__against  the government targets the whole lot of  labour  laws    it  is  not  for  the  benefit  of  the  labourers  the  workers  and  the employees of our country but for the benefit of corporate and for the benefit of big business houses of our country  in section 64 it is said that the expression fifty hours should be changed to one hundred hours  in the statement of objects and reasons it  has been stated to  facilitate  ease of doing  business  so as to  enhance employment opportunities here the two points are contradictory  in our country we are seeing that in eight major employment generation sectors only 130 lakh to 135  lakh  people  are  being  engaged  yearly    but  every  year  more  than  one  crore unemployed youths are entering into the job market so if this government really wants  to  give  jobs  to  unemployed  youths  of  our  country  this  overtime  period should not have been increased  i find here that spread overtime is increased to 12 hours  earlier it was 10 hours and 30 minutes  finally i would like to say that majority  of  the productive  workforce  will  be  out  of  the coverage of the  factories act  so i strongly oppose the amendment and i want our hon labour minister to look into this and request that this bill be withdrawn  
__label__against     this  bill  will  increase  the  overtime hours  in  factories    several  acts  are  passed  but  they  remain  only  in  paper    in several factories extra work is done by the employees but they are not paid for the extra  work    the  decision  of  the  government  regarding  the  working  hours  for women  employees  is  welcome    the  government  should  make  provision  for  pf esi etc facilities for daily wagers employed in factories  interest of employees be taken care of putting in extra hours of work regarding their safety salary and other aspects  there are several factories where employees work for long hours but they do not get their agreed salary  such companies should be taken to task    shri  muthamsetti  srinivasa  rao  avanthi  indian labour laws  are  intrinsically  connected  to  our  freedom  struggle    the  factories amendment  bill  is  seen  as  one  of  the  landmark  labour  law  reforms  mooted  by the  government  which  is  keen  to  promote  its  make  in  india  campaign  to  boost domestic  manufacturing    manufacturing  is  crucial  for  both  jobs  and  investment and  it  is  hamstrung  by  the  archaic  factories  act  of  1948    the  government proposed 54 changes to the factories act 1948 of which the major amendments are  provisions  relating  to  imposing  obligation  upon  the  occupier  to  make  a provision  of  personal  protective  equipment  for  workers  exposed  to  various hazards  providing  canteen  facilities  in  factories  providing  for  shelters  or  rest room  and  lunch  rooms  in  respect  of  factories  employing  seventy  five  or  more workers  etc    i  welcome  these  provisions  because  they  are  in  the  interests  of  the workers    the  andhra  pradesh  government  in  april  2015  issued  a  circular allowing women to work in factories in night shifts  i support this bill  
__label__appreciation __label__for   i  rise  to  support  this  bill  i welcome  the  amendment  proposed  for  overtime  in  the  bill  because  no  one  ever gave  it  a  thought  ever  since  the  year  1987  several  hon  members  citing  the  bill introduced  in  the  year  2014  termed  it  antilabour  i  do  not  find  any  antilabour clause  in  the  bill  there  is  no  provision  in  the  bill  which  makes  overtime mandatory for any labourer the time limit of fifty hours has been extended in the bill and i do not think the labour force would have any problem with it most of the people are  anxious because of growing unemployment in the country but i do not think overtime clause would create the problem of unemployment it would not affect    the  unemployed  persons  in  a  small  state  like  assam  there  are approximately 25 lakh unemployed youth the reasons for this unemployment rate should  be  looked  into  i  feel  that  the  steps  taken  by  the  nda  government  to promote  self  employment  and  entrepreneurship  under  the  skill  development scheme and setting up a ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship  and strengthening it financially by allocating rs 12 thousand crore would help resolve the  problem  of  unemployment  to  some  extent  the  condition  of  tea  gardens  in west  bengal  and  assam  since  independence  should  also  be  looked  into  the working condition of labour force there is very bad if the labour force would work overtime  they  will  be  paid  for  it  this  aspect  would  be  covered  under  jan  dhan yojana  and  atal  pension  yojana  the  maximum  limit  of  pension  has  been  made rs  1000  i  want  that  the  government  should  also  do  something  about  the remaining unorganised labour force   
__label__callforaction __label__for     i  congratulate  the  hon minister for trying to implement as many labour laws as possible  a special order should  be  issued  that  along  with  the  drinking  water  cleanliness  should  also  be taken care of  first aid box is missing in several factories  this aspect should be considered    whenever  there  is  a  major  case  or  accidents  take  place  as  a  special case  the  labour  courts  may  conduct  the  hearings  of  the  cases  in  the  premises itself  this will help the employees  whenever there is a dispute the government should  insist  on  tripartite  consultations  in  all  factories    another  point  is  the inspection  done  by  the  labour  inspectors  could  be  made  more  transparent    with regard to pregnant women and disabled women not being able to enter into tankers and chambers we appreciate the government for including appropriate provisions in the bill as far as employing of women before 700 am and after 600 pm in factories located in sez is concerned it is good but it should be done with proper security   we have a textile factory in andhra pradesh this is run by the national textiles  corporation    the  government  should  give  proper  guidance  so  that  the machinery  is updated  and  the  working  conditions improved in  the  bill there  are provisions regarding canteen shelters rest rooms and lunch rooms  so wherever more  than  20  workers  are  employed  in  a  factory  providing  of  canteen  shelters rest  rooms  and  lunch  rooms  should  be  made  mandatory    yesterday  the  hon minister  was  mentioning  about  providing  help  to  the  school  run  by  the  mica factory at kalichedu  i would request him to consider extending help to this school and  provide  consolidated  pay  to  the  seven  teachers  who  are  there  to  help  150 students in the only school which is run by the ministry of labour in kalichedu  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against  i would like to thank you for giving me time to speak on this important bill the attempt to make the hour of working from 8 to 50 to 100 hrs is against natural justice my second request is that it will result in  increase  in  unemployment  because  capital  is  meant  for  earning  profit  and  if  it can take more work from one person then it will not employ more person  it is a global phenomenon  lakhcrores of youths are engaged in the unorganized sector organized  sector  manufacturing  sector  and  service  sector  on  a  salary  of  rs  15 thousand  per  month    in  the  outsourcing  system  the  contract  system  minimum wage is not being paid  they get such low salary that it becomes very difficult to lead  a  comfortable  life  if  something  is  to  be  done  it  should  be  done  for  the unemployed youths they should be paid reasonable wages  the labourer is forced to work more due to inflation and decline in real wages he will throw himself in the work for his family i request you to roll back this law and overtime which is being introduced

__label__defect __label__against   the factories act was amended seven times during the  last  70  years   there  is  a  contradiction between the  statement  made  in this  bill  and  the  opinion  of  the  standing  committee   there  are  many  provisions which are sought to be amended  the hon minister has chosen to amend only two sections  that is section 64 and 65  without discussing other clauses amending the sections in the original parent act how can we pass this bill  the aim of the government to introduce this  bill is to  see the  enhanced  employment opportunities  i do not understand how by increasing the hours of overtime they can  increase  the  employment  opportunities    whereas  the  standing  committee  in its  report  has  stated  that  increasing  the  overtime  hours  across  the  factory  would certainly  have  an  adverse  impact  on  employment  generation    so  there  is  a contradiction between the opinion of the standing committee and the intention of this bill so i would request the hon minister to withdraw this bill and come with the  bill  which  is  already  introduced  in  this  house  which  was  referred  to  the standing committee  so i would request the hon minister to withdraw this bill   
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against     amendment  bill  2016  is  being discussed  this  act  was  enforced  in  the  year  1948  for  the  first  time  afterwards amendments were brought about in 1949 1950 1951 1954  1970  last time the amendment was made in the year 1987 however under the present circumstances and with the advent of new technology as well as on the recommendations of the international  labour  organization  and  other  committees  this  proposal  was introduced  in  the  form  of  a  bill  on  7th  august  2014  later  on  it  was  sent  to  the standing committee hon khargeji has also opposed it i also want to tell the hon minister that only sections 64  65 have been brought for amendment in case of making provision of overtime for increasing the working hours of the labourers a little more time should have been given to the said bill and after sending it to the committee  it  should  have  been  discussed  there  labour  organizations  have  also opposed it at several places  therefore i also oppose this bill and simultaneously i want to give a piece of advice to withdraw this bill and it should be sent to the standing committee  such misinformation has been spread in the whole country that the industrialists are behind the introduction of this bill the leaders of labour unions  have  sent  letters  to  us  and  tried  to  make  several  efforts  to  meet  the  hon minister  thus  there  is  a  need  for  seeking  suggestion  from  the  standing committee after sending the said bill to the committee   
__label__defect __label__allegation __label__against   this bill is not a progressive one and rather it is a regressive one  the governments intention is not to bring more workers  under  the  ambit  of  the  factories  act  but  to  remove  them  from  the protection of the factories act  this act really requires substantial amendments in this  era    because  first  outsourcing  is  increasing  in  an  alarming  way  second privatisation is taking place in a big way and third growth of unorganised sector is another  big  challenge    the  priority  in  economic    reforms  is  money  first  market second  machinery  third  and  man  last    the  trade  unions  throughout  the  country were  demanding  a  comprehensive  improvement  in  the  factories  act  giving emphasis on health and safety    in economic reforms also due consideration has not been given to the interests of the working classes   the government does not want the working class to raise its voice and it has not consulted the trade unions this kind of ill motivated and anti labour actions will be fought and defeated by the working class in our country    
__label__defect __label__against   today we are present here to discuss the  factories  bill  2016    on  the  one  hand  the  prime  minister  says  that  the government  will  work  towards  providing  employment  to  more  and  more  young people but here when we are discussing this bill we are talking about increasing the  overtime  the  government  wants  to  increase  the  employment  hours  of  those working in the organized sector  the government has talked about increasing 50 hours  duration  to  100  hours  duration  and  has  fixed  the  maximum  period  of overtime  to  125  hours    there  is  no  such  provision  in  the  entire  bill  which indicates  that  the  young  person  doing  overtime  will  get  an  increase in  the  salary  the  mention  of  giving  overtime  is  related  to  organized  sector  only  whereas  80 people  in  our  country  work  in  the  unorganized  sector  factory  act  applies  to  the factory engaging three hundred people it means that the government has not made any provision of overtime for the factories engaging less people than the figure of 300  it is mentioned in the bill that there was a demand from the industries side  but  we  do  not  make  any  effort  to  bring  any  bill  taking  into  consideration  the farmers demand railways never make any provision taking into consideration the daily travelers demand the government in a hurry has just carried out the task of amending  only  section  64  and  65  of  the  factories  act  1948   if  the  government goes  on  taking  such  steps  it  will  lead  to  discouraging  skill  india  programme mudra scheme and other such schemes initiated by the government  i oppose this bill and would like to seek clarification from the hon minister in this regard  
__label__defect __label__against   ensuring  adequate  safety  measures  to the workers is the sole intention of the factories act of 1948  unfortunately the proposed  amendment  bill  is  totally  against  the  sole  intention  of  the  original  act  when a comprehensive bill is pending for consideration of the house what is the emergent  necessity  in  bringing  such  an  amendment  to  sections  64  and  65    the power  to  frame  rules  is  vested  with  the  state  government    by  this  amendment arbitrary authority is being conferred upon the government of india to frame rules  according  to  the  original  act  itself  it  has  very  farreaching  consequences    the right  of  the  state  government  is  being  taken  away  by  the  central  government which is against federal character of our constitution and antilabour  i would like to  know  whether  this  is  being  done  with  the  concurrence  and  the  consent  of  the states    by  allowing  125  hours  of  overtime  in  three  months  government  is indirectly banning the recruitment in factories and creating unemployment problem in the country  so my submission is to withdraw the bill or refer this bill also to the standing committee which is already pursuing the recommendations    
__label__appreciation __label__for     in  the  last year  the  government  of  india  gave  thousands  of  crores  rupees  back  to  the labourers  and  the  remaining  amount  was  spent  towards  the  welfare  of  the labourers  through this bill it has been provided to enhance the overtime hours allow  the  women  to  work  during  the  night  and  provide  security  to  them    it  will give  a  fillip  to  the  industries    if  the  laws  which  hamper  the  progress  of  the industries are replaced by a better law it will encourage the industries and generate employment opportunities  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   the government is effecting these two amendments on the demands of the industries the government should bring in the amendment bill which was brought in the year 2016 for the benefit of forty crore  labourers  during  the  next  session  of  the  parliament  the  government  has increased the number of overtime hours but no increase has been made  in the rate of  overtime  several  industries  pay  overtime  on  basic  salary  and  dearness allowance  thereon  i  demand  that  the  rate  of  overtime  should  be  fixed  on  gross salary provisions to this effect should be there in this bill    
__label__defect __label__against   the factories act 1948 has been enacted after the independence and before the adoption of the constitution  by this legislation the safety health and welfare of the workers of the factories have been taken care of    by  this  amendment  the  state  has  extended  its  hands  to  the  factories  by appointing a welfare officer to ensure safety and welfare of the workers  but we have been told that our nation is a welfare state  but if this amendment is passed by this house we can no more say that this is a welfare state  our nation should not  be  run  by  the  corporates    but  our  nation  should  be  run  for  ensuring  the welfare of the poor and the downtrodden workers  the government is enhancing the  overtime  hours    it  will  impede  employment  opportunities  and  will  affect  the very health of the poor workers  so i would request the hon minister to withdraw this amendment     
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   my first suggestion is with regard to  the  coordination  forum    the  mandate  of  this  forum  should  be  extended    in  a recent  assocham  report  it  is  stated  that  barring  these  20  iims  there  is  only  7 per cent campus placement in the remaining business schools which are providing mba  degrees    therefore  these  iims  could  play  the  role  of  a  mentor  for  other business schools so that their standard also could be improved  our iits and iims are  one  of  the  best  brands  in  the  world    therefore  the  council  of  iits  and  the coordination  forum  for  these  iims  should  work  in  close  coordination    the foundation  stone  of  the  iim  in  my  parliamentary  constituency  rohtak  laid  in  the year  2011  but  so  far  only  35  per  cent  of  work  has  been  completed    i  therefore request that the construction work of this iim should be expedited    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against  it is very good to have autonomy of such institutions  but i am not sure whether total autonomy is very good for any of the institutions or a person even  i would only express some apprehensions about this bill    first  of  all  is  that  the  formation  of  the  board  itself  is  fallacious    so  how come  the  board  can  appoint  the  persons    in  case  some  illegally  irregularity corruption  or  nepotism  goes  on  in  this  board  how  would  the  board  be accountable    this  is  my  first  apprehension    how  will  all  these  20  institutes  be upgraded  and  taken  as  institutes  of  national  importance    the  educational  parity should  be  there    how  are  we  going  to  do  it    i  think  only  coordination  forum cannot  do  it    everybody  has  said  about  the  students  fees    that  is  also  my apprehension    who  is  going  to  decide  the  fee  structures    the  bill  says  that  the board will be responsible for the fee structure  but the contribution of the central government or whatever budget is there that will be decided by the board  that means the budget should not be same for all 20 institutes and the fee structure will also be different in all these institutes whereas the entrance exam will be same for all  i would like to have some clarification on that    
__label__appreciation __label__for   this  is  a very  important  which  is  concerned with  the  future  of  our  youth    so  far  as  the  control  over  these  iims  is  concerned after giving autonomy definitely there is a government body like the cag which will  look  after  their  functioning    the  biggest  advantage  of  this  bill  is  that  it empowers these institutes  for providing degrees   this  would certainly  give  them an identity at the international level  i therefore support this bill      
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   as  many  as  22  hon members  have  put  forth  their  very  good      view  points  on the future of  20  indian institutes  of  management    i  really  thank  them  all  for  supporting  this  bill  members of all the parties have spoken in favour of autonomy of  these institutes  this  clearly  indicates  that our  country  has  been progressing  and  this also  sends  a clear message to our countrymen in this regard  now the world could see that we have taken an initiative for providing autonomy to these institutes in real sense  as i said earlier we must trust our best brains and our best institutes  these institutes have proved time and against that they are the institutes of excellence  when they are institutes of excellence we must accord them the status of institutes of national importance    as  i  said  there  will  be  a  parliamentary  accountability    setting  the system  is  the  issue    we  must  set  the  system  in  order  and  then  things  roll  out automatically    today  other  universities  have  become  famous  because  they  are independent  and  autonomous  and  that  is  the  basic  strength  of  our  educational institutes  to  survive  and  flourish    i  am  very  sure  with  this  historic  decision  we will  really  make  a  change  and  our  iims  will  go  to  the  next  level  and  the  whole education sector will aspire to be more quality oriented  regarding research what was happening earlier  it is because the fellowships of iims were not regarded by many as phds and that was the problem and therefore there were less students for phds  to  become  fellows    now  the  research  will  be  here    the  research management  is  very  important  because  it  is  changing  world  and  we  will  get  that research now based in india done in india and used in india and world over also  that  is  the  basic  thing    and  this  is  the  vision  of  prime  minister    he  wants  to make  a  difference  and  give  real  autonomy  to  the  higher  educational  quality institutes so that they flourish and reach to their optimum  now i will come to the other  issues    as  for  higher  education  finance  agency  hefa  it  has  started functioning  higher education finance agency will put in nearly three billion dollars in the  next  three  years  into  the  higher  education  sector  to  essentially  upgrade  and create  new  world  class  research  infrastructure    that  is  the  aim  with  which  the higher  education  finance  agency  will  be  working    rs  2  crore  is  given  under rusa to good colleges and rs20 crore to good universities  the government has invested  in  rusa  more  than  rs4000  crore  and  it  has  resulted  in  good development  of  infrastructure   technical  education  quality  improvement programme  has  three  phases    the  third  phase  is  all  about  hilly  states  northeastern  states  andaman  and  the  socalled  earlier  bimaru  states  odisha jharkhand madhya pradesh rajasthan uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal  it is a rs2800 crore worth programme  imprint is a research initiative in which we  ask  proposals  in  10  domain  areas  from  all  the  professionals  working  people students  teachers  and  faculties  from  everywhere    the  government  has  received 1500    proposals  and  out  of  which  200  have  been  finalized    the  government  is going to give rs600 crore and it has already started rolling out and the research is on  uchhatar avishkar yojana is relating to industryacademia interaction  many people  talked  about  incubation  centres    incubation  centres  are  there  in  the  iims iits and in all these higher learning institutes  we have also started one proposal of gyan where 600 professors from 58 countries had come last year and each one conducted  a  course  here  by  remaining  here  for  23  weeks    that  has  benefited hugely  the  students  and  the  teachers  this  year  800  foreign  professors  from  60 counties  are  coming  here    this  type  of  exchange  was  needed  and  that  is happening  we  are  recording  it  also    these  courses  will  be  available  on swayam also  so there are many number of initiatives of quality improvement  the  cabinet  will  soon  take  a  decision  about  the  world  class  universities    10 institutes in public sector and 10 in private sector will be today called as institutes of eminence but after certain time we aspire that in a decade they will acquire the ranking of the first 200 and then they will also go up in the first 100  to address the issue of faculty we have to imbibe and inculcate the teachership    through  variable  packages  we  want  to  attract  the  good  faculties    we  are also  attracting  best  of  the  indian  researchers  who  are  doing  research  work  in foreign countries  as there will be more and more people returning to the country there  will  be  more  and  more  people  available  as  faculties    this  is  how  we  are going ahead and the faculty issue will be done away with  regarding the issue of expenditure i would like to inform that in 201314 it was rs284 crore in 201415 it was rs320 crore in 201516 it was rs460 crore in 201617 it was rs722 crore and in 201718 it is going to be rs1030 crore this is the progression of the expenditure   the  hon member  also  mentioned that  there  are 14  institutes  which do  not  have  directors  posted    however  there  are  only  four  institutes  where  the post  is  vacant    so  far  as  fees  is  concerned  let  me  be  very  clear  that  no  merit student  or  a  student  who  is  eligible  for  admission  will  be  denied  education anywhere    that  is  the  affirmative  action  which  the  government  has  promised  for  this  scholarship  meritcummeans  scholarship  and  earn  while  you  learn schemes are also there  we will ensure that no genuine student loses the chance of getting higher education because he does not have money  in terms of reservation it  is  available  for  student    for  faculty  reservation  the  government  has  issued specific  direction  that  we  must  make  positive  and  affirmative  action  to  fill  up scst and other reserved vacancies of faculties    with regard to board of governors there will be no role of government in selection of board of governors   it has tenure of four years and only two terms  the issue of mother tongue has come up which is quite important  this is possible but the material and conditions will have to be prepared  i feel that management institutes can understand the market forces    the bill as amended was passed 
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  would  like  to  thank  the minister for his eloquent introduction of this bill  i do have some concerns  the larger  point  is  that  we  have  in  our  country  a  potential  demographic  dividend because of our youthful population but it is very clear that if we do not revitalize our  education  sector  particularly  higher  education  sector  this  demographic dividend potentially will transform into a demographic disaster  we have seen the consequences  of  that  in  our  tribal  areas  with  the  maoist  movement  the  naxalite movement    the  problem  lies  at  heart  in  this  governments  inability  or unwillingness  to  provide  the  necessary  resources  required  to  be  able  to  drive  our higher education sector towards the demographic dividend  what have we seen in the share of budgetary outlay towards education  in the most recent budget it was stagnant at only 37 per cent and only a meager 15 per cent has been allocated to higher  education    only  three  of  our  iims  feature  in  the  list  of  top100 management  schools  in  the  world  as  per  2017  financial  times  ranking    when you  have  an  institution  of  national  importance  it  must  also  be  an  institution  of budgetary  importance    the  government  launched  the  pandit  madan  mohan malaviya national mission on teachers and training  there is no progress in the establishment  of  centres  in  the  universities  and  a  tiny  fraction  of  the  fund  has been utilized since 2014  26 per cent of faculty posts in the iims and 35 per cent of  faculty  in  the  iits  are  lying  vacant    for  quality  we  need  resources  we  need money we need facilities and we need faculty  the government has also delayed the implementation of the higher education financing agency  the story of our countrys  economic  resurgence  would  be  incomplete  without  acknowledging  the critical  role  collectively  played  by  the  iims    these  have  realized  the  hopes  and vision of the man who established the iims  pandit jawaharlal nehru  the bill is clearly  an  improvement  on  the  earlier  draft  that  was  circulated  by  the  ministers predecessor    i  congratulate  the  government  for  coming  up  with  a  very  farreaching  bill    i  think  it  is  really  a  remarkable  moment  when  a  government minister in our system actually surrenders power  i want to congratulate the hon minister that he has taken this step  i hope he will follow it in other institutions  one particular feature i want to congratulate the minister for is that he has insisted that the board shall comprise three women members  the coordination forum is an interesting initiative  the bill is completely silent on the issue of reservation in teaching  staff  particularly    earlier  there  was  a  specific  provision    what  is particularly  worrying  is  that  of  the  233  faculty  members  in  the  six  iims  that  we have  information  for  only  two  belong  to  the  scheduled  caste  community  and none from the scheduled tribe community  i propose that the government in its next step should have a more ambitious management education bill so that other management  institutions  can  benefit  from  these  reforms  create  a  national management university  lack of control of the government over the quantum of fees  may  lead  to disadvantages for the  marginalized  sections  in  our society   the need  of  the  nation  could  not  be  properly  met  if  students  from  poorer  families would have to undertake the burden of very heavy loans just to be able to study in a  government  institution    another  concern  is  lack  of  fulltime  directors  in  the iims    as  these  institutes  have  done  a  great  deal  for  india  i  hope  that  the government  will  see  this  bill  as  an  opportunity  to  bolster  the  potential  of  these institutes    
__label__appreciation __label__for   our  institutes  are  not  only  famous in india they are famous all over the world  all the iims are working well  we want  to  declare  them  as  institutes  of  national  importance  so  that  they  can  award degrees    hence  it  will  be  a  regular  mba  and  not  a  diploma    it  will  not  be  a fellowship  but  a  phd    most  important  issue  is  that  we  are  going  to  give  them autonomy since the government believes that if we cannot trust the wise persons of  the  country  then  we  cannot trust  anybody   earlier the  government  appointed the board chairman and the search and selection committee  but now onwards the government will no longer have any role in appointment which will be done by the board of governors  earlier the minister used to be the chairman of the iim council    now  this  will  no  longer  be  the  case    besides  now  iims  would  be audited  their  annual  report  would  be  laid  on  the  table  of  the  house    after autonomy iims can have excellent faculty and give them variable package  they will be able to conduct their affairs themselves  hence it is a historical bill    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  i am proud to say that our top three management institutes    abc  that  is  ahmedabad  bangalore  and  calcutta  do  compare favourably with the best institutes of the world  these three come within the top 200 management institutes in the world and now these institutes are being declared as  the  institutes  of  national  importance    the  government  has  clearly  stated  that this is done so that they can award degrees  now they will give mba and phd degrees which is a very very welcome step  also the big thing about this is that the  iims  are  being  given  complete  autonomy    since  iits  are  also  under  you  i would  urge  you  to  give  autonomy  to  the  iits  also    however  the  national  level institutions  like  aiims  and  national  law  schools  are  not  under  this  ministry  whatever  is  under  our  ministry  you  follow  this  policy  of  giving  them  autonomy which we will appreciate  there are so many private institutes of management but still  the  iims  occupy  the  top  position  which  means  that  the  institutions  set  up  by the central government are still the best in the country  i want the government to really maintain this pristine superiority which the central government institutions have  achieved    as  i  said  earlier  one  of  the  objects  mentioned  is  that  the management  education  and  research  should  reach  top  levels   but  the  research  in management has not developed so much  so i hope that this step will give  thrust to research in management education which is changing every day  similarly it is also necessary for management experts to become itenabled  now the question is that government has not put any control on the fees  apart from that now already the fees of iims are very high and unless the students get scholarship or education loans  of  around  rs  20  lakh  it  is  not  possible  for  a  bright  boy  even  if  he  has cracked  the  common  admission  test  cat  for  iims    i  would  like  more scholarships  to  be  instituted  by  the  iims  so  that  no  bright  student  is  denied management  education    please  ensure  this  so  that  money  does  not  become  a stumbling block for pursuing management studies  i hope that management in our country  will improve  and  india  will become  a  big  economic  power in another  10 years    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   when  india  got  independence  the government  was  looking  forward  for  largescale  industrialization  in  the  country  the  idea  of  iim  then  cropped  up  as  there  was  a  need  for  innovation  for industrialization    now  times  have  changed  and  so  have  changed  the  job descriptions  iims were set up in the decades of 1960 and 1970  iims were seen as skill development research institutes  30 years ago we had never thought that there would be jobs like wellbeing coach offshore wind farm engineer chief listening  officer app  developer genetic  counsellor logger webanalyst  etc  today  we  are  witnessing  industrial  revolution  in  a  different  way  and  we  need  a talent  pool  with  artificial  intelligence  nanotechnology  and  3d  printing  because the youths of the country aspire to move forward with them  iims formulated their organic  structure  at  a  large  scale  with  which  foreign  faculties  also  got  associated with   i would like to speak on the four aspects of this bill as they are important ones    granting  autonomy  to  iims  is  of  vital  importance    i  would  like  to  thank hon  minister  and  hon  prime  minister  for  granting  great  amount  of  autonomy  to the  iims in this  bill    the  youths  of today  want  that their thinking  should  not  be stifled  as  they  will  get  empowerment  from  this  autonomy  only    secondly  the government  has  proposed  that  the  board  of  governors  will  have  three  women members and five members from alumni network as iims have got strong alumni network    when  iims  had  started  a  development  office  in  the  year  2014  iims raised  rs200  crore  in  just  three  years  to  support  these  facilities    if  the  former students  of  these  institutes  intend  to  support  their  institutes  then  they  need  to  be given autonomy  we all should appreciate it  the third important point relates to appointment of directors and board of governors  once the directors and board of  governors  get  the  autonomy  then  they  themselves  would  decide  as  to  how  to make  them  centre  of  excellence    the  fourth  important  aspect  relates  to accountability  which  is  proposed  to  be  ensured  through  the  cag    an  hon member  was  referring  to  the  previous  version  of  this  bill  wherein  there  was  a provision  to  include  five  members  from  the  government  also    but  in  this  bill only two members are proposed to be taken in the bog from the government side  there are already 74 institutes of national importance in the country and 20 iims are  going  to  be  added  to  them    but  iims  have  got  more  autonomy    i  would therefore request the hon minister to bring all the institutes of national importance on one platform and these institutes should also get same amount of autonomy  i believe that the youths aspiration is the countrys hope and the iim network has to inspire them for building a great nation    
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   the  most  important  thing  which  i  like  in  the bill is the autonomy given to these institutes  that is what we required for a long time  unless you give autonomy along with responsibility and accountability we will  not  get  the  desired  results    apart  from  20  iims  there  are  hundreds  of institutions  which  are  functioning  in  the  market    we  do  not  have  any  idea  as  to what  sort  of  education  they  are  imparting  to  the  students  who  are  studying  over there  i would like to ask the government that whether there standards equivalent to  that  of  iims    secondly  government  has  made  provisions  in  this  bill  that  all these  iims  will  be  under  the  purview  of  the  rti  also    so  we  will  have opportunities  to  know  what  is  really  happening   apart  from  that some  institutes are indulged in current practices with regard to admission process  similarly fees are  very  high  which  one  cannot  afford    students  who  had  taken  loan  for  their education are not able to repay their loan just because they have not got the job of that  remuneration  or  of  that  quality    so  we  have  the  increasing  npas  on  this account also  this is again a matter of concern  so what is the government going to do to protect talented students  apart from the existing institutions suppose a new iim is to be opened than i would like to know from the government that who has got the power to form the board  in the education field when we talk about reservations  and  other  things  then  we  have  the  talented  people  from  our  scst categories  also  therefore  we  should  impart  a  very  high  and  standard  level  of education to our students    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   iims  are  elite  institutions  of our  country    only  the  most  meritorious  students  finally  make  into  these institutions    additionally  the  high  fees  charged  at  iims  which  is  between  rs  9 lakh and rs 20 lakh also prevent several students from less privileged background from  taking  admission  to  these  institutions    there  are  currently  20  iims  across india  based on reports iims put together have about only 8000 seats  compared to this there are about 5500 other business schools that offer mba degrees  while i  commend  the  governments  effort  to  further  improve  the  standard  of  education and research at iims i also ask whether the government is aware of the fate of the other five lakh noniim mba degree holders  autonomous status and other things which are going to be implemented through the bill are very good  but what about others    according to  reports beside  the 8000  iim  graduates only  35000  of  the five lakh mba graduates get jobs  most of these jobs offer a salary of hardly rs 10000 per month  so i urge the government to take steps to improve the standard of these other bschools as well as secure the future of such students  moreover increased  fee  in  business  schools  and  unavailability  of  placements  are  the  two major  reasons  for  less  number  of  candidates  applying  for  the  common  aptitude test cat  every year there is a drop in the number of candidates applying for cat  one of the main reasons behind this drop is that a lot of students now prefer foreign universities over iims  in foreign universities there is a possibility and a chance  to  a  scholarship  but  after  this  new  bill  gets  enacted  will  there  be  a provision  of  scholarship  in  these  institutions    i  would  also  like  to  point  out  that certain  recommendations  of  expert  committees  formed  by  parliament  have  not been addressed to in the bill  i ask the government for a response regarding as to why two specific recommendations pertaining to board autonomy in pay fixation and  creation  of  standing  committee  for  management  were  not  considered  and whether  they  would  be  considered  and  implemented  in  future  or  not    i  want  to draw  your  kind  attention  to  iim  sambalpur    iim  sambalpur  is  running  from  a rented  building    my  request  to  the  government  is  to  clear  the  stand  of  the government with regard to signing of the mou in this regard

__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  think  the  government  is  definitely  and befittingly  grating  autonomy to these institutions thereby  decreasing the government  interference  and  increasing  the  autonomy  of  the  institutions    our state  andhra  pradesh  has  unfortunately  got  bifurcated    of  course  it  was  very scientifically  done    as  far  as  central  universities  are  concerned  we  feel  very lucky  that  they  are  coming  in  andhra  pradesh    but  iim  visakhapatnam  is working  like  a  surrogate  institute  because  there  is  no  fund    therefore  you  are requested  to  allocated  more  funds    apart  from  this  abc  iim  ahmedabad  iim bangalore and iim calcutta which are wellknown to provide autonomy to other institutes is also a very good step  but out of the total number of faculties which are  233  or  something  only  two  or  three  are  from  the  scheduled  castes  and scheduled  tribes  category  under the  reservation  policy   this type  of representation  of  scs  and  sts  in  our  higher  institutes  like  iims  and  iits  is  most unfortunate   iims being the beacons  of knowledge are the  ones  who can create prosperity through  business trading  manufacturing  and  enough  financial activities    these  are  the  people  who  are  heading  the  international  institutes  also  for example indra nooyi is from an iim and she is heading pepsico  therefore these iims definitely need to be boosted and more quality faculty need to be also given  regarding accountability there is some problem  also please see to it that they do not enhance the fees on account of their capacity to award degrees

__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  would  like  to  extend  my  thanks  to  the  hon prime  minister  and  the  wise  minister  for  declaring  indian  institutes  of management as the institutions of national importance and providing autonomy to these  institutes    i  believe  this  is  the  best  example  of  the  minimum  government maximum governance  today this will go a long way in meeting the shortage of faculty in iims  moreover this bill will empower these management institutions to award degrees  this will provide three types of autonomy to these institutions namely educational autonomy administrative autonomy and economic autonomy  i  would  like  to  urge  the  hon  minister  to  develop  such  a  mechanism  that  may enable  the  poor to afford  the  fee and have  access  to education  in  the  institutes of national  importance  like  indian  institutes  of  management    i  would  also  like  to urge the hon minister to make syllabus of these institutes reflective of the ground reality  i support this bill    
__label__callforaction __label__for   this  is  a  most  welcome legislation  which  seeks  to  declare  20  existing  iims  as  institutions  of  national importance  i must congratulate the hon minister for showing a good model  the government  is  not  interfering  in  appointing  the  head  of  the  institution    at  the same  time  have  to  realize  our  weakness  also    we  have  no  exposure  to  rd institution  and  industries    the  linkage  and  industries  and  linkage  with  rd institutions  is  the  need  of  the  hour    i  would  like  to  say  something  regard  to  the reservation    the  sachar  committee  which  is  known  as  the  magna  carta  of  the minorities  in  the  country  has  conserved  that  in  the  higher  education  institutions such as iit iim and the central university the representation of the minorities is negligible    that  is  to  be  corrected    when  we  talk  about  inclusive  development these kinds of issues will have to be addressed properly  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   at the outset i would like to thank the  government  for  bringing  a  bill  which  seeks  to  declare  20  iims  as  the institutions  of  national  importance  and  also  to  empower  those  institutes  to  award degrees  to  the  students    this  will  facilitate  iims  to  become  autonomous institutions prevent government interventions and allow good management to take place    i  am  a  representative  from  bihar  where  a  single  iim  was  set  up  at  bodh gaya in 2015  i would like to urge the government that the number of seats in this institute  should  be  increased  to  300  or  400  like  other  iims    only  three  courses namely finance marketing and hr are being run in this institute  all the courses should be allowed to be offered in the iim bodh gaya  the seats of this institute are not fully filled up and hence this is also required to be taken into account  iim bodh  gaya  is  being  operated  under  the  control  of  iim  kolkata  and  hence  it requires to be made independent  thats why iim bodh gaya should be made selfreliant    even  today  iims  are  reeling  under  the  shortage  of  faculties    so  the vacancy of faculties should be filled up at the earliest  at last i would like to urge the hon minister to set up one more iim at nalanda in bihar  
__label__callforaction __label__for  i would like the hon minister to consider a few suggestions    firstly  the  two  members  to  be  appointed  by  the  government  the central government and one of the state government  amongst these members the government may please ensure that they are from academic background with academic  excellence    these  are  supposed  to  be  institutions  of  educational excellence  they should have extension centers in rural areas and backward areas and isolated areas otherwise excellence will remain confined to a few urban areas and a few rich people  the medium of instruction in those institutes is english  a large  section  of  our  population  does  not  understand  english    therefore  the children should be taught in their own mother tongue  i request the hon minister to  kindly  take  this  aspect  also  in  view    the  board  itself  would  appoint  its  own chairperson  this is a good thing but who will appoint the board this thing should be clear  there will be 19 members in the board out of which one member each will be appointed by the central government and state government  but who will appoint  the  remaining  19  members  this  should  also  be  made  clear  in  the  bill  there is provision in the bill that relates to appointment of teaching faculty  the faculty  plays  an  important  role  in  technical  institutes    therefore  the  people belonging to weaker sections like minorities and people of rural areas should also given  proper  representation  in  it    so  there  should  be  reservation  in  board  of governors and teaching faculty as per the government policy otherwise the very intent  of  the  bill  would  be  defeated    the  fee  in  these  iims  is  very  high  so  the government should give 100 per cent exemption in fees for the students belonging to bpl families and weaker sections  the government should bear the burden of their fees only then there would be justice with the talented students of rural areas  similarly the students belonging to poor families and deprived sections of society and of rural areas should be given reservation at the time of campus placement in these institutes  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  also  take  this  opportunity  to congratulate  the  hon  minister  for  bringing  a  good  bill  to  protect  the  academic standards  in  our  indian  institutes  of  managements  in  the  country    the  sole purpose  of  this  bill  is  to  give  effects  to  a  statutory  recognition  and  also  to  give autonomous  status  to  the  higher  educational  institutions  in  the  country    i  would like to suggest that government have to strive in such a way that india becomes the best destination  for  having  higher  education  and  quality  education   i have  sound reasonable  apprehension  about  clause  92  which  says    that  every  institute  shall strive  to  raise  funds  for  selfsufficiency  and  sustainability    as  regards  fee determination  i  would  urge  upon  the  hon  minister  to  take  this  aspect  into consideration because  higher  fees  means  that  the  poor  and  common  students  will be  denied  the  right  to  have  access  to  higher  educational  institutions  like  indian institutes  of  management  in  our  country    you  kindly  understand  my  point  with regard  to  clause  10    the  governing  body  or  the  board  of  governors  is  the executive  body  of  the  institute  and  the  board  will  consist  of  the  chairperson nominated  or  appointed  by  the  board    except  the  central  government representative  and  the  state  government  representative  all  other  representatives are being nominated by the board  so at least convince this house as to how this board  is  going  to  be  constituted    as  regards  receiving  donations  and  gifts  from foreign countries it has to be restricted and some condition should be there    
__label__callforaction __label__for     we  should  also  start  course  on  stress management  the kind of explosion of knowledge is taking place in the world due to  internet  we  need  to  start  a  course  on  management  of  knowledge  also    the number  of  people  who  understand  english  in  the  country  is  between  6  to  9  per cent    whether  the  iims  are  meant  for  only  those  students  who  read  and  write english  there should  be  an  iim  out  of  these 20 institutes  where  particularly  the medium of instruction should be only in hindi    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   there  is  a  shortage  of  21  per  cent  in  teaching faculty in the 20 iims  these vacancies would increase in future  so whether the government  has  chalked  out  a  road  map  to  fill  these  vacancies  in  a  time  bound manner    besides  whether  the  government  would  give  representation  to  each section  of  society  while  filling  these  vacancies    i  also  want  to  know  from  the government  whether  there  would  be  a  common  entrance  examination  or  separate examination  for  admission  in  these  institutes    at  the  same  time  the  level  of  the paper  in  different  languages  should  also  be  the  same    there  is  no  iim  in marathwada  region    i  therefore  request  the  hon  minister  to  establish  an  iim either in aurangabad or hingoli  i also request that all these institutes should be provided a level playing field so that all the students get same  kind of placement  in  addition  to this the  students belonging to  weaker  sections of  society  like  scs sts and obcs should be given scholarship    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   the government talks of reducing the cost of litigation  however it is my belief that we may not achieve this since there is no transparency  in  this  bill  regarding  fees    i  am  of  the  view  that  appointments  of judges  for this  purpose  should  be the  same  as their  appointments  in other  courts  such  appointments  can  be  made  by  a  panel  of  commercial  experts    i  hope  that about one crore commercial cases pending in various courts would be disposed of quickly   my  suggestion is that the limit  of  one  crore  rupee should  be  reduced  to rupee 25 lakhs   there should be provision strict implementation of the law  i am of the view that if the government succeeds in bringing complete transparency in this bill then those who prefer singapore and london to settle their cases will be attracted to india for speedy disposal   
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  if commercial disputes are resolved within 6 months then it would create trust among the investors  this is a well considered bill in the interest of the country  crores of cases are pending in the lower courts  the delay in justice is also a reason for increasing crime  unless all the vacancies of judges are filled up in the regular courts this problem cannot be solved  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   i rise to oppose this bill  in order to replace  the  ordinance  a  new  bill  is  introduced  in  this  house  during  this  winter session when an identical bill is still pending in the rajya sabha and the matter is under  the  scrutiny  of  the  standing  committee    coming  to  this  bill  why  i  am opposing this bill is all the enactments or the legislation coming in this house is for ease of doing business  almost all the legislation which is being aggressively pursued by this government is for ease of doing business and not for the common downtrodden  people  of  this  country    can  you  suggest  any  bill  which  is  for  the common  people  of  this  country    the  indirect  way  by  which  the  bill  is  being pushed through or bulldozed through the lok sabha with the huge majority of the government is my first objection  the executive is given ample power to define what is a commercial dispute  even the parliament is not having the authority to define the crux of the legislation  the same things is there for specified value also  chapter v of the bill deals with the transfer of pending suits and application under the arbitration act to the commercial courts  it is also contradictory  there is no definition  as  far  as  the  commercial  courts  or  the  commercial  divisions  or  the commercial appellate tribunals are concerned  the arbitration and conciliation bill  of  2015  is  silent  about  the  definition  of  commercial  dispute    even  this  act also  is  silent  about  the  arbitration  proceedings    what  mechanism  will  be applicable in a case where the specified value is more than rs one crore which is also a commercial dispute  i would like to know whether such a case will be decided by  the  high  court  as  per  the  original  jurisdiction  envisaged  in  the  arbitration  and conciliation  actor  or  it  will  be  done  by  the  commercial  division    the  legislation violates article 14 of the constitution because through this legislative we are creating a classification like poor vs rich  that classification is not a reasonable classification  this means that a poor man will have a poor treatment and the rich will have a better treatment    this  has  to  be  taken  care  of  as  far  as  poor  and  common  people  are concerned  there is haste and hurry so as to pass this bill and this itself means that it is not for the common people of the country and it is only for a particular class of the society  so i strong oppose this bill  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   india leads the world in the number of pending  cases    more  than  2  crore  6  lakh  and  57  thousand  and  841  cases  are pending  out  of  which  more  than  40  lakh  cases  are  commercial  in  nature    the previous  government  set  up  gram  nayalyas    do  they  exist  now    the  court should  monitor  cases  above  rs  1  crore    however  how  many  people  in  our country have rs1 crore  i would request the hon minister to reduce this amount to  rs  25  lakh  so  that  medium  level  shopkeepers  can  also  get  justice  from  such courts    are  you  going  to  set  up  a  new  parallel  system  to  the  district  courts  and appoint judges with commercial background to monitor commercial activities  if a person is appointed judge in the commercial court as per rules roster changes after every six months  if a judge is appointed in a commercial it will take him atleast six months or one year to understand the commercial activities and by that time he would be transferred  why can we not appoint judges as we appoint ias and ips  poor  person  can  never  get  justice  in  the  high  courts  and  the  supreme  court because he does not have lakhs and crores to pay the lawyers    
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   this  bill  has  been  brought  in  backdrop  of  the intention of this government to mobilise a large amount of foreign investment for the country    some  of  the  foreign  companies  hesitate  to  run  their  business  in  india    in view of the litigations which go on for years  with the passing of this legislation all the commercial disputes and cases involving an amount of more than one crore which have been pending in various high courts and civil courts will be transferred to the concerned commercial divisions  and commercial courts  with the setting up of such courts  speedy  justice  could  be  ensured  and  it  would  result  in  saving  of  billions  of rupees  involved  in  various  long  pending  litigations  related  to  various  projects  of different  sectors  of  economy    this  money  could  be  utilized  for  increasing  the productivity  this bill will be a historic step in promoting make in india campaign and enhancing the business prospects and even those entities will be able to invest in india who at present are fearful about making any investment into the country  crores of cases are pending in the various courts of the country  i am pretty optimistic that this bill will prove effective in reducing the burden of pendency in courts    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   several  hon  members  have  given their pertinent suggestions regarding this bill  i would like to speak on the issue of empowering the panchayati raj institutions  lakhs of cases are pending in various courts    if  trivial  or  small  cases  could  be  dealt  at  the  level  of  panchayats  the burden  on  higher  judiciary  will  decrease    lok  adalats  have  tried  to  dispense speedy  and  economical  justice  but  the  rot  in  the  system  has  not  yet  been  fully stemmed   so timely  and speedy  dispensation of  justice  if needed   the  criminal cases  bring  out  the  worst  flaws  in  our  judicial  system    people  are  wrongly convicted  at  times  in  cases  of  cr  pc  302    so  justice  becomes  a  casualty  at  the alter of clout and influence wielded by the rich and the powerful  the government                                                             original in punjabi must  come  to  the  aid  of  the  poor  people    there  should  be  transparency  in  the banking transactions  farmers generally take agricultural loans  if their standing crops are destroyed due to natural calamities the farmers fail to return their loans in  time    so  the  government  must  bail  out  such  hapless  people    the  small families will gain out of this bill  
__label__against   it  has  been  seen  across  the  tenures  of  various governments that the route of ordinance is followed whenever government wants to favour the capitalist industrialists and the elites  today the government has brought this bill for setting up the commercial courts  its fine but the initial route of ordinance by the government is not justified  the government should bring such a bill which could ensure prosperity and progress for the country  i request that the government should  review  this  bill  and  send  it  back  to  the  standing  committee    it  may  try  to bring it back once the standing committee considers it    the minister of law and justice shri dv sadananda gowda replying said the purpose of the bill is to accelerate economic growth improve the international image of the indian justice delivery system and the faith of  the  investor  world  in  the  legal  culture  of  the  nation    commercial  disputes require  better  understanding  and  specialization    continuously  keeping  some judges who are not specialized in the subject also creates delay in the disposal of the cases  here in the bill we have made a provision as to how persons who are specialized in commercial matters would be posted and how they are to be trained  commercial  matters  should  be  dealt  with  separately    this  bill  does  not  violate article  14  of  the  constitution  and  it  does  not  infringe  upon  any  right  of  poor people  by taking away commercial matters from the normal courts they can deal with other cases quickly and speedy disposal can be brought about  recently we passed  a  bill  the  delhi  high  court  amendment  bill  2015  where  we  have enhanced  the  jurisdiction  of  the  district  court  of  delhi  from  rs20  lakh  to  rs  2 crore  in commercial courts bill the original jurisdiction of the delhi high court is rs 2 crore and above  once the delhi high court amendment bill is notified automatically all the cases of commercial disputes below the value of rs 2 crore will  be  transferred  to  the  district  court    so  we  thought  it  fit  that  both  these legislations should be brought together  as a result the delhi high court bill was notified and simultaneously the commercial courts ordinance was promulgated  we promulgated this ordinance to avoid confusion  a few of our friends said that it ought to have been referred to the standing committee again  but i want to say that when the standing committee was taking evidence from various stakeholders the  ordinance  was  brought  to  the  knowledge  of  the  standing  committee    in  its report  everywhere  they  observed  that  this  ordinance  has  been  promulgated  and concurred with it   some of the members mentioned about pecuniary jurisdiction  in this regard i want to say that if the government feels it can certainly enhance the pecuniary jurisdiction of the court  one of my friends asked as to why appeal has  to  be  made  in  the  high  court  only    in  this  regard  i  want  to  say  that  where there  is  an  original  jurisdiction  the  commercial  bench  will  be  established  there and  commercial  appellate  division  also  will  be  there    so  automatically  the appeal  will  go  from  the  original  side  to  the  appellate  side    with  regard  to pendency of cases this government has taken several initiatives and that is why so many  cases  have  been  disposed  of  rapidly  in  various  courts    about  pendency  in the high courts as on 31122012 it was 4434 lakh and as on 31122014 it had come down to 4153 lakh  we will computerize all the courts  about pendency in the district and subordinate courts the pending cases have been reduced by four lakh  i hope that this bill will have a bigger impact on judicial reforms the bill as amended was passed  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  though this bill is very good i would like to say a few things which should be considered as suggestions not as criticism  there are about 1017 sanctioned posts of judges in courts are lying vacant  similarly there are about 2 crore 6 lakh cases pending in courts out of which 67 per cent cases are of  criminal  nature    in  such  a  scenario  how  one  can  imagine  the  expeditious disposal  of  cases  in  commercial  courts    the  government  should  think  over  this and expedite the process of appointing judges  we should form an indian judicial service  for  the  appointment  of  judges  in  the  same  way  as  the  upsc  appoints candidates for ias and ips  today there is an urgent need for improvement in our judicial delivery system so that people could get speedy justice  the government should also consider about those 67 per cent cases of criminal nature in which the fundamental  rights  of  people  as  given  in  our  constitution  often  get  violated  therefore we also need to improve our criminal justice system    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   the  rationale  for  this  legislation  is  the  ever increasing  number  of  commercial  disputes  that  crop  up  as  a  result  of  increasing economic activity in the country  it is a fact that there is a huge pendency of high value  commercial  disputes  the  reduction  of  which  is  necessary  to  make  india  a desired  a  more  attractive  and  a  more  favoured  destination  for  investors  to  do business  in    the  quick  adjudication  of  commercial  disputes  would  faster  the growth of trade and commerce   it is a regrettable that some ouf our laws remain archaic  the civil procedure code is of the year 1908  the need of the laws is to evolve with the changing times  the subordinate judiciary is burdened with about three crore pending cases  the main aim of creating the commercial courts is not only reduction of the pendency of suits already filed but also to quickly dispose of the new cases that would be filed  our party has reservations on two points in the bill   one  is  with  regard  to the  specified  value  as defined  under  section 2  1i for  a  commercial  dispute  as  per  this  section  is  rs  1  crore    we  want  that  to  be enhanced to rs 10 crore at the least  under the provisions of sections 19 and 20 of  the  bill  cast  an  obligation  on  the  state  government  to  provide  infrastructural facilities    the  centre  should  provide  substantial  funds  for  the  establishment  of these infrastructural facilities  in order to fulfill the objective of quick disposal of pending cases the vacancies in the judiciary at all levels should be filled up  the quality of the legal education imparted in india is a matter of grave concern   the mushroom growth of substandard law colleges should be curbed    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   at the  outset  i  oppose this commercial courts commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts bill 2015 which seems to have been drafted in a halfhearted manner  a  this  juncture  i  would  suggest  that  the  bill  be  referred  to  the  standing committee more so since it has not gone through the scrutiny  i begin to point out a  few  mistakes  that  i  have  noticed  in  this  bill    i  refer  to  chapter  13  clause  12 which  very  clearly  states  that  cases  only  above  rs  1  crore  would  be  handled  by commercial courts  how would this change in law affect the work of judges or the courts  is  something  that  is  to  be  considered    it  seems  that  the  government  is actually creating this provision only to help big business  this specific sum of rs 1 crore seems a little dicey to me  the government is not interested in solving the problems of those companies which have disputes of value lesser than rs 1 crore  section  4  states  that  the  judges  for  these  courts  will  be  appointed  by  the  chief justice of respective state high courts  why not involve the state governments also    what  will  be  the  criteria  for  allotment  of  judges  to  a  particular  case    we need more transparency in this matter in order to ensure that justice is served not only served but it should also seem to be served which is of very vital importance in  india  today    suppose  it  falls  through  in  lok  sabha  or  let  us  assume  it  falls through  in  rajya  sabha    then  your  ordinance  would  also  lapse    some  people who  have  jumped  into  the  net  which  you  created  to  protect  them  from  23rd october 2015 till the beginning of this session which was 26th of november what happens  to  them    will  they  get  your  benefit  or  will  they  be  deprived  of  the benefit  who are the companies    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   i welcome this bill on behalf of my party  this  is  really  a  good  step    there  are  so  many  cases  pending  in  courts    this  is really a cause of concern for the common man  this is the reason as to why most of the people do not want to go to the courts and get their issues resolved outside the courts  the setting up of commercial courts would certainly give some relief to the  people  but  we  will  have  to  appoint  suitable  judges  for  the  purpose  and  they should also be provided training in micro economics  all the judgements of these courts should come  within a stipulated time frame   the government should also think as to how dispose of such a large number of cases pending in our courts  if the government is really interested to set up commercial courts they should first think as to how to make them attractive for people so that people go there and get justice  though setting up commercial courts is really good and we welcome that really  we  should  think  how  trained  judges  could  be  appointed  in  commercial courts  and  appellate  divisions  of  the  high  courts  so  that  speedy  justice  is  given  what  we  need  more today  is that people should get speedy  justice   i  would  also like  to  know  from  the  hon  minister  as  to  what  they  have  thought  of  appointing judges in these courts

__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  this bill in fact is the need of the hour  with this  bill  it  will  improve  the  faith  of  the  investors  in  legal  culture  of  the  nation improve  the  international  image  of  the  indian  justice  delivery  system  and consequently  it  will  accelerate  the  economic  growth  of  the  country    in  the globalized  economy  and  in  the  international  trade  the  commercial  disputes  have increased to a large extent  we need specialized courts for this purpose  all over the world the specialized courts have been set up and we are far behind for setting up  of  these  specialized  courts    i  congratulate  hon  law  minister  that  six  months time  has  been  provided  to  dispose  of  the  matter    the  commercial  courts  are proposed to overcome the delay in judicial process and so far the government of india  is  committed  to  create  an  fdi  friendly  environment  to  attract  more  foreign investment in economic growth of the country  now this bill creates courts where the original jurisdiction of the high court is also there  so my suggestion to the hon  law  minister  is  that  the  original  jurisdiction  of  all  the  high  courts  may  be repealed  and  uniform  jurisdiction  of  all  the  high  courts  to  be  created  in  the country  again we have to evolve a transparent method of appointment of judges and appoint those judges having specialised knowledge in commercial law  apart from this in advanced countries like european and american countries process of prelitigation mediation is there  but in our country we are not finding any law  if this  process  and  this  provision  is  taken  into  consideration  at  least  like  in  other countries in our country also we can mitigate these grievances to a large extent and around 75 percent cases can be reduced  my suggestion to the hon law minister is  that  we  can  include  all  acts  which  are  dealing  with  the  commercial  disputes  those acts can be clubbed together and can be made as a part of the schedule of this  bill    apart  from  that  we  have  to  take  into  account  that  we  establish  these courts  on  pilot  basis    not  only  this  we  have  to  create  the  state  of  the  art infrastructure  and  human  resources  including  judges  and  staff    if  we  have specialized  courts  then  our  justice  delivery  system  will  also  be  of  international level    as  a  result  the  fdi  will  increase  and  consequently  the  economy  of  the country will grow  so far as the criminal justice delivery system is concerned it is the sovereign duty of the government but so far as civil justice delivery system is concerned it is a service being rendered by the government so for that service the government should be compensated suitably for this purpose a professional cost accounting wing should be established in every high court  it should assess the  amount  to  be  charged  and  how  much  court  fees  needs  to  be  levied  from  a particular litigant  or it  may fix a common court fee for this purpose  the cost should be provided for seeking an adjournment and it should increase gradually  if one approaches for arbitration then the sunset clause should be there  the verdict given by the arbitrator should also be binding on him   
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   i  believe  that  proposed bill will definitely bring out good legal reforms in india  we also strongly believe that  justice  delayed  is  justice  is  denied    therefore  just  as  the  hon  minister  has suggested  the  timeframe  in  the  arbitration  and  reconciliation  act  perhaps  the timeframe should also be put in respect of some of the cases particularly the cases of  commercial  nature    we  all  know  that  there  is  a  huge  backlog  and  a  large number of vacancies in courts  unless that is taken care of any number of creating additional  machineries  may  not  solve  the  problem  of  the  accumulation  of  cases  while  the  power  has  been  given  for  the  chief  justice  of  the  respective  courts  to nominate the judges as far as the special courts are concerned i would request the hon  minister  that  a  special  mechanism  could  be  evolved  where  trained  efficient and  honest  judges  could  be  considered    now  we  are  evolving  the  multiple systems    so  we  should  ensure  that  the  multiple  bodies  should  not  affect  the existing legal system  again threefourths of the undertrials are coming from the minorities dalits  and  tribals   the  hon minister  may  kindly  look  into  this  aspect and  try  to help the  weaker  sections of society   it is  the need of  the hour that  the government takes up steps to establish the indian judicial services as well so that they  are  accountable  and  answerable  like  all  other  civil  servants    i  would  also request  the  hon  minister  to  kindly  consider  the  various  aspect  of  the  summary judgment without recording the oral evidences and see how it could be effectively implemented

__label__callforaction __label__for     hon  members  would  recall  that  during  the  last  year when  similar  objections  were  raised  at  the  time  of  consideration  of  the  finance bill 2016 i had observed that as per rule 219 the primary object of a finance bill is  to  give  effect  to  the  financial  proposals  of  the  government  there  is  no  doubt about it  at the same time this rule does not rule out the possibility of inclusion of nontaxation proposals  therefore i have accepted this  the finance bill may contain nontaxation proposals also    now  another  thing  is  no  doubt  every  effort should  be  made  to  separate  taxation  measures  from  other  matters    it  should  be done  but as has been very widely explained by the finance minister i did not say the  thing  again  and  again    so  incidental  provisions  can  be  made  that  is  why keeping  in  view  that  rule  219  does  not  specifically  bar  inclusion  of  nontaxation proposals in a finance bill i rule out the point of order  
__label__defect __label__for   hon members objection is predominantly borne out  of  the  language  of  article  1101    the  critical  word  according  to  an  hon member is the word only and that is how another hon member supports him that it  is  only  the  taxation  proposals  and  nothing  else  which  is  incidental  really  can find a place as far as the money bill is concerned  with regard to this word only right from the inception of this house as to what is the width that this word only permits has been a subject matter of debate  mr mavalankar in his first ruling on this subject gave the thrust on the point that you cannot have a bill which says that the  government  shall  spend  rs100  thousand    how  that  is  to  be  spent  the incidental  provisions  will  have  to  be  contained    the  fact  is  that  these  incidental provisions to the principal provision exist do not render a bill to be a nonmoney bill  that is what mr mavalankar said  therefore the word only has to be read in the  context of the spirit of  article  110    it is  much  ado  about nothing that  you say  40  laws  are  being  amended    what  is  the  amendment    the  amendments  are incidental  to  the  acts  in  fact  these  amendments  relates  to  minor  changes  in  the original acts  the hon members also say how is electoral bonds a money bill  in the  budget  announcement  we  came  out  with  a  proposal  that  there  will  be  an income  tax  incentive  involved  in  four  different  ways    these  are  all  amendments under the income tax act and the specific provision of the income tax act which deals with this is section 13a  in the finance bill this is clause 11  these are all incidental  announcements  to  that  entire  scheme  which  has  been  made  under  the income  tax  act  itself    so  my  respectful  submission  is  that  it  is  squarely  in  the language of article     thereafter the speaker made the following observation 
__label__appreciation __label__for  once upon a time our country was known as the golden bird in the world  as per prof angus meddison the gdp of our country in the year 1000 ad contributed 32 per cent of the gdp of the world and we were the top trading nation  in the  world   now the crux of the  matter is as to  how  we  can revert back to those golden times and how can we become the top trading nation in the  world  again    for  it  to  happen  we  have  to  analyze  both  our  strengths  and weaknesses  and  we  have  to  frame  our  policies  keeping  our  country  as  their  focal point  in  order  to  move  ahead    this  budget  is  historical  in  the  sense  that  it  is completely  in  sync  with  the  economic  requirements  of  our  country    this  is  a complete  paradigm  shift  and  it  is  by  pursuing  these  policies  that  we  are  going  to attain  the  pole  position  in  the  world    very  recently  we  have  approved  four complementary gst legislations  it is through gst that the country is going to get rid of  the  plethora  of  taxes  which  is  likely  to  spread the tax net  and  augment  the revenue  of  both  the  centre  as  well  states    farmers  constitute  70  per  cent  of  our population and we have witnessed a record production in our country  the budget has been one of the regular features of our polity  however what is novel about this budget is that we have prioritized it keeping in view the 70 per cent population of  the  country   the  top  most  priority  has  been given  to  the  agriculture  and  rural sectors    irrigation  capacity  has  to  be  augmented  to  increase  the  income  of  farmer  irrigation facilities are not available for 65 per cent of land out of total 142 crore hectare  agricultural  land      for  the  first  time  in  the  country  a  provision  of  rs 50000 crore has been made for irrigation facilities from the year 201516 to 201920    the  government  has  tried

__label__defect __label__allegation __label__callforaction __label__against   before  i  dwell  on this bill i would like to put on record my opposition to your ruling in relation to the  finance  bill  though  under  article  110  the  final  authority  rests  with  you  and this  has  to  be  accepted  by  all    our  hon  finance  minister  while  presenting  the budget tried to paint a rosy picture of our economy and also a sense of satisfaction was  distinct  in  his  speech  in  fact  in  his  speech  he  tried  to  convey  that  our economy was performing well and was ready to take off  we do not agree with it  we understand that our economy has been underperforming and in the prevailing circumstances  our  economy  could  not  reach  where  it  should  have  reached    the government has not been able to give impetus to our economy in these three years   our  gdp growth  rate  stands at 7  per  cent  even  after demonetization the  country should be satisfied about it  however it should be compared with the growth rate of 10 years period during the upa government  during upas 10 years rule the average growth rate stood at 78 per cent and thereafter promise of exalted achchhe din  was  made  and  naturally  the  growth  rate  should  have  improved    we  do  not have any exact data based on the new series as of now but taking into the account the new series formula introduced by the new government our growth rate during the  10  years  period  works  out  to  be  113  per  cent  instead  of  78  per  cent    many apprehensions are being expressed on the 7 per cent growth of our gdp based on the  new  series    the  government  should  give  convincing  reply  to  it  so  that  the credibility of our economy remains intact  seven per cent growth rate of our gdp is primarily consumption driven  we all know that in the last quarter of the year consumption growth has risen  it was due to good rainfall and implementation of the 7th pay commission  likewise the government is getting the windfall of steep reduction in the prices of oil  if the benefit of 7th pay commission and fall in oil prices is taken away then the actual growth rate of our gdp will come down to 6 per cent only  however the youths of our country need jobs  in the year 2010 the investment  proposals  relating  to  large  medium  and  small  industries  were  to  the tune  of  rs17  lakh  36  thousand  crore  and  also  in  the  year  2011  the  investment proposals received were to the tune of rs15 lakh 39 thousand crore and in the year 2016  the  investment  proposal  have  come  down  to  rs3  lakh  93  thousand  crore only  in fact when investments are made factories get set up and jobs are created   the capacity utilization in the industry was 80 per cent in the year 2011 which has come down to 70 per cent now  the health of our corporate sector is a concern for all of us  one more startling fact i would like to place before this august house as to  how  much  the  nonfood  credit  offtake  and  the  loan  amount  is  being  obtained for  setting  up  factories    the  industry  has  taken  the  least  loan  from  banks  in  the last  quarter  during  the  last  60  years  and  still  the  government  says  that  our economy is in good shape in the country  as far as exports are concerned when this government was formed in the year 201314 our government had left a trail of  262  billion  exports  per  month    after  three  years  of  this  government  the exports  stand  at  212  billion  we  should  have  taken  advantage  of  the  prevailing situation in the world which is being reflected in low prices of oil and commodities and  we  should  have  taken  advantage  of  the  stagnating  chinese  economy  as  well  however  we  have  failed  to  take  advantage  of  these  developments    india  should have become the factory of the world replacing china but this place is being taken by  the  countries  like  vietnam  and  bangladesh    there  are  several  sectors  like garment  apparel  and  footwear  etc  which  are  job  intensive  sectors  which  means that  these  sectors  create  disproportionately  larger  amount  of  jobs  for  every  one lakh  investment  as  compared  to  the  other  sectors    if  we  employ  our  finite resources  as  investments  in  these  sectors  then  we  can  not  only  replace  china among  the  major  exporters  in  the  world  but  also  provide  employment  to  the millions of youth keeping in tune with the promise made by your government for creating 20 million employment opportunities every year  the data on job creation which  is  coming  out  is  worrisome    the  international  labour  organisation  has estimated  that  india  is  the  only  emerging  economy  in  the  world  where unemployment  is  going  to  grow  for  the  next  two  years  ie  in  the  year  2017  and 2018  the formulation of taxation policy of a country should be directed towards addressing  the  problems  like  jobless  growth    therefore  when  corporate  tax  was cut we had hoped that some sectors  would be provided package  however what the government has done is that it has reduced the corporate tax rate from 30 per cent  to  25  per  cent  across  the  board  in  respective  of  those  companies  whose turnover is less than 50 crore  this is not the right policy  i would like to urge the government that keeping in mind the prevailing state of economy and the kind of gloomy  forecast  about  the  job  creation  being  made  by  the  world  agencies  the government should provide sector specific breaks otherwise we will not be able to face the situation  taxation policy has an important role to play in addressing the gap between the poor and the rich  today as far as taxation is concerned the tilt is very  much in favour of indirect taxes which are to be shared by all equally  the direct  taxes  have  been  decreasing  while  the  indirect  taxes  have  been  increasing during the last three years  the direction of economic policy is a matter of concern and it is causing and will continue to wider the gap between the poor and the rich  we  have  to  ponder  over  the  policy  framework  which  does  not  allow  this  gap  to increase    the  tax  on  petroleum  is  considered  one  of  the  most  regressive  and retrograde in nature  the excise duty during our government was rs 110 per litre of  petrol  and  rs 135  of  one  litre  diesel  which  has  been  increased  upto  rs 895 and 796 respectively i would like to demand that the government should reduce the  duty  on  diesel  and  petrol  by  atleast    rs  5  so  that  this  message  could  be  sent across the country that while the government is inclined towards cutting the rate of corporate tax it is also considerate towards reducing the duty on diesel and petrol  the credit off take of the banks has come down at the lowest level during the last 58 years and the advance tax mop up of the government until march has increased at a rate of only 6 per cent  these are alarming signs  i would like the government to  pay  attention  towards  the  policies  which  may  strengthen  the  economy  of  the country    the  government  has  also  been  trying  to  impose  a  very  draconian measure  on  the  people  of  the  country  through  this  finance  bill    there  is  a proposal  of  vesting  more  power  into  the  hands  of  income  tax  authorities  with regard  to  search  and  seizure    through  this  measure  there  is  a  preparation  for unleashing the tax terrorism in the country  under the subsection of the 1 a of the section 130 of income tax act it is clearly stated that the income tax officials are obliged  to  give  the  reason  before  they  carry  out  search  and  seizure  operation  however  now  the  government  propose  an  amendment  in  this  section  and  this requirement has been dropped under it   earlier the power of making a subjective decision  lied  with  the  income  tax  officials  but  some  objective  material  was required  for  it    now  it  is  being  said  that  there  is  no  requirement  for  any  such material and it has been completely deleted  this is wrong and against the  tenets of  natural  justice  and  such  provision  does  not  exist  anywhere  in  the  world    not only this the government propose to implement the proposal retrospectively from 1962    i  would  like  the  government  to  pay  attention  towards  this  provision    i would also demand that the government should also fulfill the promise it had made for  raising  the  exemption  limit  of  personal  income  tax  upto  rs  5  lakhs    the government  had  also  promised  to  implement  of  the  swaminathan  commission  our government during its ten years tenure had continuously increased the msp of wheat  bazra  and  paddy  etc    however  this  government  has  only  effected  an increase of 4 per cent per annum during the last three years in place of an increase of 15 per cent  and still the government talks about the doubling of the income of the farmers  therefore it is our demand that the government should implement the recommendations  of  the  swaminathan  commission    i  also  demand  that  all  our suggestions  related  to  the  finance  bill  should  be  accepted  to  give  the  necessary fillip  to  the  slow  moving  economy  and  to  create  necessary  employment opportunities for the government to fulfill its promise of creating 20 million jobs     
__label__defect __label__allegation __label__callforaction __label__against  this finance bill when it was presented on 1st february 2017 had 150 clauses and seven schedules  but strangely enough the finance  minister  in  his  series  of  amendments  added  33  new  clauses  and  two schedules  i do not understand why in a finance bill which is supposed to detail the  taxation  proposals  of  the  government  they  have  brought  in  the  abolition  or uniformisation  of  the  tribunals  which  have  no  relation  to  taxation  proposals directly    there  has  been  no  significant  effort  to  lower  the  taxation  rates  so  that collections could be improved  in case of income tax the government is giving up  rs15000  crore  with  small  income  tax  payers  getting  rs12500  and  it  is gaining  rs2700  crore  by  taxing  the  bracket  between  rs50  lakh  and  rs1  crore  with  regard  to  the  corporate  tax  for  companies  having  turnover  up  to  rs50 crore the tax has been reduced to 25 per cent  due to this the total tax given up is rs7200  crore    the  total  reduction  in  taxes    to  the  government  comes  to rs20000  crore    there  are  otherwise  no  major  changes  in  the  tax  rates  in  the budget    government has  given  tax  concession  with  regard  to affordable housing having  carpet  area of  30  to  60  square  meters   completion  period of  housing  has also  been  extended  from  three  to  five  years    the  other  thing  is  that  there  is  tax relief in partial withdrawal from the national pension system  this is a welcome step in the sense that those who are saving through national pension scheme will get this benefit  another good step is that the chief ministers relief fund has been exempted  from  taxes      the  government  has  given  a  long  list  of  concessions  on customs duty  some concessions relate to proposals involving change in customs duty for incentivizing value addition make in india  the government has formed this budget with the expectation that the gst would give rise to better collection  the government has increased the money for infrastructure etc  now where will the  money  come  from    the  funding  of  such  expenditure  seems  to  be  left  to  the mercy of implementation of the gst which is likely to bring in more taxes to the centre  and  states  as  also  transfer  of  resources  from  the  tax  evaders  to  the government through  demonetization   however  gst is likely to  have contractionary  effects  in  the  shortterm  particularly  in  the  year  of  imposition  thus the tax revenue is likely to fall this year  the peoples expectation was that the  income  tax  exemption  limit  would  be  raised  to  rs5  lakh  but  only  a  small concession  has  been  given  on  income  tax  the  government  has  not  given  farm loan  waiver    demonetization  did  not  turn  out  to  be  a  bonanza  as  roughly  rs15 lakh crore was demonetized and almost rs15 lakh crore has been deposited  for remonetization  the  cost  is  as  per  my  estimate  rs20000  crore    rs6500  crore extra  tax  was  generated  through  demonetization    so  demonetization  has  been  a total loss  demonetization crushed the small farmer the artisan the daily labourer and  one  day  the  government  will  have  to  pay  the  price    the  gst  is  to  be implemented  from  1st  july  2017  if  the  initial  year  of  gst  is  poor  in  revenue accruals then where will the government get the money from  the budget has a long  list  of  giveaways  and  government  programmes  in  the  context  of demonetization  hurting  the  economy  but  little  in  the  way  of  jobcreating  reform  india needs reforms to create jobs by opening itself up to global supply chains to incentivize  firms  to  grow  so  that  they  can  compete  globally  and  work  harder  to teach  skills  to  young  people    one  million  people  are  joining  the  job  market  in india  every  year    in  2015  only  135000  new  jobs  were  created  in  this  country  every year we are creating an army of the unemployed   the budget encourages companies  to  remain  small  because  they  are  giving  concessions  to  smaller companies but not to bigger companies  the budget india needed to do something to  revise  investment  since  private  investment  showed  no  signs  of  recovery    the government  is  going  for  privatization    today  the  finance  minister  announced that  he  is  going  to  disinvest  bridge  and  roof  kolkata  bharat  pumps  scooters india hindustan newsprints and eight more companies  they are destroying the basis  of  the  public  sector    i  totally  oppose  these  disinvestment  proposals  of  the government    this  budget  does  not  tell  us  how  much  black  money  government has  recovered  so  far    this  finance  bill  does  not  show  a  way    the  finance minister  has  not  laid  down  a  roadmap  by  which  he  will  be  able  to  mop  up  more resources  from  the  rich  and  give  more  relief  to  the  poor  so  that  the  economy improves

__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   the  rising  npas  in  the country  had  always  been  a  cause  of  concern  inside  the  house  as  well  as  for  the economic  experts   the nationalization of banks during  1960s and 1980s resulted in  greater  banking  coverage  and  it  was  felt  that  people  would  get  rid  of  private lenders    however  the  low  efficiency  declining  productivity  and  bad  portfolio management of banks resulted in declining profitability for the banks as a result of  which the public as well as private sector banks faced a plethora of problems  the pressure  on banks  started  mounting  we  all  might  recall here  the shares scam  of 1990  and  how  the  then  government  constituted  narsimhan  committee  which  is also known as bsr committee  the narsimhan committee in its report submitted in  1993  had  proposed  the  enactment  of  recovery  of  debts  due  to  banks  and financial institution act  the government of the day ensured the passage of the act in 1993  prior to this the banks had to take resort to the civil courts in order to recover  the  debts  which  resulted  in  significant  loss  of  time    however  with  the enactment of this drt act the banks could recover their debts without going into civil  courts  through  tribunals  and  appellate  tribunals    however  the  shelter provided to the industries by  bifr act acted as a stumbling block in deriving the expected outcomes from the drt act  thereafter sarfesai act was brought in parliament in  2002   undoubtedly  this  act proved as  a  milestone  for  the  banking industry in india because it was under the  provision of the act that the banks got the  power  to  sell  the  properties  held  as  collateral  with  them  in  recovery  of  their dues  and  they  were  also  given  the  power  to  selfadjudicate  in  this  regard  with coming into force in 2004 this law enabled the industry to make positive progress in  the  direction  of  reducing  the  burden  of  npas    however  owing  to  certain shortcomings in the existing laws burden of npas continued to increase  thus the burden of bad debt on the banking system continued to rise  during the last one to one and half years the bad debt in our economy has increased from a level of rs 297  trillion  to  437  trillion    the  number  of  cases  pending  in  various  drts  and drats  is  around  70  thousand    the  economic  crisis  brought  by  the  global recession  in  201011  resulted  in  several  industries  facing  liquidity  crunch  which further resulted in an increasing stress on our banks  the present government with a view to ensure the recovery of the stressed assets and creating an atmosphere of ease  of  doing  business  started  to  take  several  initiatives  for  bringing  in comprehensive  economic  and  banking  reforms    the  hon  minister  of  finance  in his  budget  speech  of  2016  had  expressed  such  a  desire  before  the  august  house that  the  government  intends  to  bring  bipronged  strategy  to  achieve  the  said objective    as  a  part  of  the  exercise  the  first  level  of  initiative  included  the enactment of the insolvency and bankruptcy code 2016 which was passed by both the houses of the parliament  as a part of the second set of initiatives this bill has been brought and this house is presently discussing it  this bill primarily seeks to amend four acts namely sarfaesai act indian stamp act 1899 depositories act 1996 and drt act  now i would like to mention the proposed amendments in the bill  when the banks want to take possession of collateralized properties in order to recover their debts they have to seek the prior permission of collector or the  chief  metropolitan  magistrate   this process  was  very  time  consuming   the proposed bill has put a time limit of 30 days for it  the jurisdiction of drt  has been well defined in the bill keeping in view the very important role being played by  them  online  process  has  been  provided  in  drt    the  very  concept  of  central registry for assets has been strengthened under the act  several provisions have been made in the bill for strengthening and streamlining the work of arcs  the bill provides for arcs to be exempt from paying stamp duty for the registration of any asset it seeks to transfer in its name during the process of debt recovery  the definition of secured creditors has also been modified in the proposed bill and the debentures  and  trustees  registered  with  sebi  have  also  been  accepted  as  secured creditors the definition of property has been reworked in the bill by including all the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  under  it    the  appellate  jurisdiction  which  had been missing under the drt act 1993 has also been defined in this bill  in this bill  the  reserve  bank  of  india  has  been  empowered  to  regulate  the  asset reconstruction companies in order to have effective control over them in case of noncompliance  of  the  instructions  of  the  rbi  the  provision  of  penalty  has  been raised  from  rs 5  lakh  to  rs 1  crore such  a  provision  has  been  proposed  as the asset reconstruction companies are not able to violate the rights of the borrowers proposed amendment bill and the rbc code 2016 will not only usher in a new chapter  of  economic  reforms  in  the  country  bringing  about  improvement  in  the banking  sector of  the  country indian  banks  will  not only  be  relieved  of  the  npa burden  but  banks  will  have  a  level  playing  field  on  the  basis  of  the  international banking  rules i  would like to  thank  the hon finance  minister  for  a  grant of  rs 25000 crore to the banks in the budget of 201617 i believe that after the passage of the proposed bill the outcome will be as expected in the economic horizon of the country

__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  i am sure and confident that this bill will help in reducing these npas and 70000 cases that are pending involving more than rs 5  lakh  crore  in  debt  recovery  tribunals  in  india  today  the  bill  is  proposing  to amend four acts first i would talk about the sarfaesi act the committee has brought  out  some  valuable  modifications  with  regard  to  the  definition  asset reconstruction  company  but  its  provisions  did  not  specifically  mention cooperative  banks  here  the  objective  is  not  under  which  legislation  they  are included  but the objective is to bring down npas of each and every bank even the rbi was in favour of bringing state district and urban cooperative banks under the sarfaesi act  so i am sure the hon minister can find some way to include cooperative banks under this act as well the bill also does not have a definition for  borrower  it  should  specifically  include  a  person  who  has  taken  loan  or advance  from  an  institution  other  than  the  bank  so  i  would  suggest  for consideration  of  the  hon  minister  to  also  include  definition  for  borrower  to make this clearer amendments to the sarfaesi act are also important because the implementation of this act is quite pathetic it is because of the hurdles that the drts  put  in    and the  drts  are  routinely  granting  ex  parte  stay  of  such  action and  thereafter  the  matters  will  hang  for  years  together  so  i  suggest  for consideration  of  the  hon  minister  that  stay  under  section  132  134  and  14  of the sarfaesi act up to 10 lakhs should be given to district magistrate or civil court instead of giving elbowroom to borrower to maneuver and sneak away under section 17 from drt i have a small suggestion to make with regard to clause 10 of the bill which proposes to amend section 12 which deals with penalties for noncompliance  of  directions  of  the  rbi  rs  1  crore  is  proposed  but  no  timeframe has been fixed within which it has to be paid i submit that the penalty should be paid within a period of 30 days from the date of issue of notice clause 26 of the bill  proposes  to  amend  section  6  of  the  second  act  the  proposed  amendment increases the age of the presiding officer of a tribunal from 62 to 65 but there is a proviso which says provided that any presiding officer of a tribunal who has completed his term shall also be eligible for reappointment as a presiding officer it  means  the  po  can  be  appointed  again  and  again  how  many  terms  can  he  be appointed  the  amendment  is  silent  i  suggest  for  the  consideration  of  the  hon minister that only one additional term may be permitted the second point i wish to make is relating to clause 29 of the bill which proposes to substitute subsection 5  with  a  new  subsection  but  in  this  clause  no  period  has  been  specified  within which  defendant  has  to  submit  the  documents  so  i  suggest  that  it  should  be specified  that  the  defendant  will  not  have any  right  to  file  written  statement  after expiry of 45 days  out of five chairpersons of drts in the country only two are in  position  today  and  out  of  39  presiding  officers  of  drts  nine  are  vacant  i wanted to know from the hon minister what steps he is taking to fill the vacancies and by when they are likely to be filled also i welcome that clause 30 of the bill permits  electronic  filing  of  recovery  applications  documents  and  written statement it should be followed in all judicial matters this will not only save time but also money with these observations i once again support the bill and request the hon finance minister to ponder over the suggestions made by me which i am confident will help in better implementation of the bill

__label__for   we  welcome  the  national institutes of technology science education and research amendment bill 2016 to  add  the  nit  in  andhra  pradesh    however  it  is  also  my  duty  to  bring  this attention of this house the complete disregard of this government for the principle of quality in its quest for mere quantity what for instance is the current state of this  year  nit  in  andhra  pradesh    the  nit  with  900  students  functions  out  of  a temporary  campus  there  are  no  laboratories  no  libraries  no  high  quality  it  or engineering  tools  for  training    we  have  a  situation  where  we  have  created  an institution  which  was  not  ready  to  be  launched  but  in  a  haste  they  have  gone ahead   i  want  to  contrast  this  to  what  we  have  just  seen  in  my  constituency  two weeks ago when a fully functioning central polytechnic the best known in kerala established  in  1949  was  derecognized  by  the  aicte  for  not  fulfilling  a  list  of conditions that they deemed had to be fulfilled if that same list were applied to the new nit in andhra pradesh it would have been derecognized by the same aicte so  the  problem  in  our  system  is  that  our  higher  education  is  overregulated  and undergoverned    there  is  a  larger  problem  that  is  hidden  behind  this  bill    even our premier iits are facing today a shortage of trained faculty  according to the governments own figures it is about 42 per cent in the iits but in the nits the shortage  is  now  in  the  glaring  vicinity  of  50  per  cent  of  the  authorized  faculty    we cannot run education like this  on top of that employers across the board are complaining  about  the  unemployability  of  indian  graduates    a  recent  ficci survey shows a figure of 62 per cent of employers are dissatisfied with the quality of our engineering graduates the fact is that in our haste to add more on paper we must not lose sight of the fact that these are meant to set new and higher standards  we are spending in the latest budget of this government  12 per cent of our gdp on higher  education   whereas south  korea  which  is  not  far  away   it  is  24  per cent  double  of  what  we  are  spending    even  our  fellow  brics  members companions  in  the  developing  world  are  leaving  us  behind    they  have  policies that focus rightly on quality and not just quantity  let me again remind you about the kakodkar committee reforms  really we ought to take those into account and implement  them    in  global  ranking  we  know  our  iits  will  feature  in  the  top hundred  when we come to the nits they do not feature anywhere in the top 500  i  fully  agree  with  the  remarks  of  the  hon  minister  about  the  importance  of innovation  india today has 17 per cent of the worlds brains because we have 17 per  cent  of  the  worlds  people    but  we  are  only  producing  35  per  cent  of  the worlds  global  research  output    what  are  we  doing  to  tap  the  possibilities  of industryacademia  interface    i  had  suggested  when  i  was  there  earlier    that  we could  allow  companies  to  come  directly  to  our  iits  and  nits  and  say  here  is  a research project  if  the  students  are  prepared  to  research  on  this  we  will have  an agreement  we  will  innovate  something  and  nit  can  share  the  profits  with  the private companies  it happens very commonly in the west  but we need a policy decision  that  will  allow  the  nits  and  other  institutions  to  have  this  kind  of relationship with companies  i ask you mr minister are we doing them justice  what  is  the  government  doing  to  align  the  establishment  of  educational institutions like this nit that we are approving today with market research  what kind of engineers do we want in india or what do employers want what does the government want what does the future want  we have talent in our country but we do not know how to mould it how to put it forward  and i would urge you mr minister that the ministry itself should come up with a national level incentive to  encourage  more  innovation  in  the  nits  iits  and  elsewhere    my  party  and  i want more higher education institutions to open their door to indias young people who are hungry for education  but we all want these additional institutions to be solid to be well equipped with teachers and resources  let us by all means declare this  nit  to  be  an  institution  of  national  importance  but  let  us  also  make  it  an institution of truly national importance    dr  kambhampati   haribabu  the  andhra  pradesh  reorganization  bill  states  the  establishment  of  about  11  institutions  in  andhra pradesh  when the state was divided we were not left with any iit iim or even a single  nit  or  iiser    i  compliment  the  government  for  taking  such  a  bold decision  to  start  nine  institutions  out  of  11  promised  in  a  span  of  20  months  of time  i also compliment the minister for providing 480 seats in the very first year of establishment of nit  the funds were allocated  i request the hon minister to take steps to see that the construction of the buildings is taken up immediately and finished  expeditiously    again  i  have  a  suggestion  for  the  hon  minister  to consider    there  are  foreign  financial  institutions  which  are  coming  forward  to finance for the projects at libor interest rates or at lesser rates  i would request the hon minister to consider this suggestion  out of eleven institutions that were promised  for  andhra  pradesh  nine  have  been  established  only  two  are  left  over for establishment in andhra pradesh one is the central university and the other is the  tribal  university   these  two  universities  are  to  be  considered  for establishment  in  andhra  pradesh  at  the  earliest    i  have  two  suggestions    one  is encouraging  quality  in  education  and  the  other  is  innovation    i  request  the  hon minister to consider how university colleges can also be brought on par with nits and  other  institutions    i  think  if  we  can  take  steps  for  this  the  quality  of engineering education can improve

__label__appreciation __label__for  it is really a great blot on the head of our nation that we are at third position in the world as far as this stigma of aids is concerned  at present approximately 3 crore 67 lakh people are suffering from this disease all over  the  world   approximately  21  lakh  people in  our  country  are  suffering  from this  disease    very  important  suggestions  have  been  made  in  the  standing committee on health  i would like to request the hon minister that though he has included  most  of  the  suggestions  there  are  certain  suggestions  given  by  my colleagues  which  need  to  be  included    the  bill  also  provides  for  expanding  the scope  of  preventive  measures  and  preserving  the  confidentiality  of  the  patients   there are 19800 ictc centres 527 art centres and 1108 linked art centres in the country to give antiretro viral therapy the government has introduced a tollfree  number  1097  on  which  any  person  in  the  country  can  get the solution of his problems    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   this  bill  has  two  aspects    one  is  human immunity deficiency  virus and the second is acquired deficiency syndrome  hiv decreases  the  immunity  of  a  person  and  makes  one  infection  prone    after becoming  infection  prone  a  person  becomes  infected  with  a  number  of  diseases  when a person is having acquired deficiency virus syndrome and we treat him in a hospital that patient is discriminated against  as a result thereof he does not get several  facilities    the  bill  will  certainly  pave  the  way  for  providing  treatment facilities to the patients and the hospital staff will not be able to deny treatment to such patients  most of the hiv patients also suffer from tuberculosis  i would like to  suggest  that  a  provision  should  be  made  for  making  it  mandatory  to  test  the tuberculosis patients for hiv infection  this bill will prove extremely beneficial in terms of providing treatment to the patients and also in terms of achieving our who mandated target in this regard    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   a  considerable  section  of  our  society  is affected  by  hiv    the  government  has  taken  an  important  measure  to  rid  the people of this disease and to prevent it  more awareness is needed in this regard  rehabilitation is more important than treatment     
__label__callforaction __label__against   there  is  gross  lack  of  awareness  in  this regard  there is no provision in this bill to spread awareness  if someone is hiv positive either he or his family faces social boycott  there should be provision of counseling in this regard  sometimes blood supplied from the blood banks is also infected    the  blood  is  transfused  to  the  patients  without  testing  it    we  should consider this aspect also    
__label__appreciation __label__for   i  thank  all  the  hon members  who  have  participated  in  the  discussion  on  this  bill    whatever suggestion  have  come  seek  better  implementation  of  the  bill    india  has  gone  a long  way  in  the  field  of  medicine  with  regard  to  aids    parliamentary  forums civil society groups activists and ngos   all played a proactive role to give their suggestions  to  the  government  and  the  standing  committee    in  1980s  it  was projected  that  aids will  become  an  endemic  and  epidemic  and  india  will  be  the epicenter of this disease  we are providing for free treatment of any hiv positive person  in  this  bill    india  has  succeeded  to  great  extent  in  its  prevention  millennium  development  goals      4  had  target  that  we  would  arrest  and  reverse tuberculosis  hiv  and  malaria    we  have  surpassed  these  goals  that  is  we  have arrested  and  reversed  the  incidence  of  these  diseases    free  antiretro  viral treatment is being provided to 10 lakh people living with hiv positive and this is the single largest art programme in the world  there are 22000 testing facilities in  india  which  are  conducting  29  crore  hiv  tests  annually    there  was  a  time when  aids  drugs  were  very  costly    but  indian  pharmacies  have  manufactured affordable  drugs  with  which  we  are  treating  not  only  indian  people  but  also  the entire africa  we have associated community people in highrisk areas to conduct aggressive awareness programme  one point raised was that there is no provision of funding in this bill  it is expressly provided in this bill that the central and the state  governments  will  provide  free  art    this  is  100  per  cent  centrallysponsored  scheme    earlier  treatment  of  a  patient  started  when  his  cd4  count reached  350  levels    but  last  year  we  have  decided  that  treatment  will  start  even when the cd4 count reaches 500 levels  now the government is planning to start the treatment just after testing positive  standing committee gave 11 suggestions out of which the government has accepted 10  the same committee had suggested to keep the words as far as possible  but at the same time i would like to assure the  house  that  even  a  single  patient  will  not  be  left  out    the  government  will provide  the  treatment    a  number  of  issues  have  been  raised    one  is  about ombudsman  it is not necessary that there will be only one ombudsman there may be two  the state government has to decide on this count  it is mandatory for the blood banks to test the blood for hepatitis b hepatitis c and hiv before storing it  till  now  we  were  following  the  guidelines  but  now  after  this  enactment discrimination with any hiv positive person will be an offence  we are leaders in manufacturing of antiretro viral drug  we are not only connected with the patient we  are  also  connected  with  the  patients  family    so  when  the  patient  goes somewhere we know how to track him  we will see to it that every minor thing is addressed while making rules  this is a historical day  the house will pass this bill which will help in eliminating hiv the bill was passed  
__label__defect __label__for   i  congratulate  the  hon  minister  for having  such  a  comprehensive  bill  after  detailed  discussion  in  the  standing committee  in  rajya  sabha  and  also  in  this  house    globally  there  are  367 million  people  who  are  living  with  hiv    india  has  third  largest  population  of people  living  with  hiv  with  an  estimated  21  lakh  people  after  south  africa  and nigeria  it is satisfying to note that the national hiv epidemic has declined over the last 15 years or so  we hope this bill will give further boost to indias efforts in  fulfilling  the  global  commitments  towards  ending  the  aids  epidemic  by  the year 2030  people living with hiv are still dying in our country particularly when coinfected  with  tb  or  hepatitisc  even  when  we  have  knowledge  and  means  to prevent  such  deaths    the  bill  says  that  the  central  government  and  the  state governments  may  try  their  level  best  to  give  measures  for  providing  antiretroviral drugs as far as possible  our suggestion is that as far as possible may be  deleted  and  a  specific  assurance  may  be  given  in  this  house    india  supplies more than 80 per cent of the antiretroviral medicines globally but it seems to be hesitating in committing to provide treatment to its own citizens  even with all the years of awareness and education we have instances of stigma and discrimination against  people  living  with  hiv    these  are  the  challenges  we  must  particularly have  in  mind  while  making  rules  in  this  regard    the  discrimination  is  also  well addressed in this bill  i fully support this bill    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against  the government claims  that  it  is  an  exhaustive  aggressive  and  progressive  legislation    but  there may  be  inexhaustive  suggestions  and  there  may  be  inexhaustive  promises  and demands which also should be taken note of  decades have passed when we are still  undergoing  the  hiv  and  aids  epidemic  and  still  profound  stigma  and discriminations are attached with the lives of those suffering from this disease  so first of all my suggestion to the government is that mass awareness is the need of the hour without comprehensive mass awareness programme government would not  be  able  to  get  the  common  people  away  from  the  spectre  of  the  stigma  and discrimination    however  most  of  the  recommendations  of  the  standing committee  have  been  accommodated  in  this  legislation    integration  of  hiv  and aids  intervention  in  primary  healthcare  system  has  taken  place  in  india  from 2010  onwards  and  during  2016  india  pledged  to  follow  targets  to  fast  track  the pace  of  progress  towards  ending  hivaids  as  a  public  health  threat  in  the  next five  years  and  ending  the  epidemic  by  2030    we  are  also  aware  that  this government  is  pursuing  the  sustainable  development  goal  whereby  it  has  been committed  that  by  2030  the  aids  and  hiv  epidemic  will  be  wiped  out    to implement  the  sustainable  development  goal  the  government  requires  funds  to the mindboggling amount of rs55 lakh crore  so i do not know how the funds will be mobilized by the government  i would like to know from the government about  its  fasttrack  target  and  that  are  the  fasttrack  targets    the  bill  misses  the fasttrack  target  of  2020  about  which  i  would  like  to  be  enlightened  by  the government  i would also like to know the rate of hiv that has turned into fullblown  aids  in  india  the  government  should  issue  a  clarion  call  to  each  and every indian that we are striving and we need a vision of zero new hiv infection zero  discrimination  and  zero  aids  related  deaths  india  records  around  68000 fatalities  every  year  from  acquired  immuno  deficiency  syndrome  and  related infections    whereas  the  national  aids  control  organizations  budget  has  been reduced by  a  whopping  22 per cent  which  left the  state  governments to  fend  for themselves  there is a controversy over section 141 of this legislation  the bill has  not  addressed  the  demand  for  the  removal  of  fourword  phrase  as  far  as possible  of  clause  141  which pertains to  the treatment  of  hiv  affected people  the  four  words  as  far  as  possible  dilutes  the  objective  with  which  indias  aids control  programme  has  worked  so  far  therefore  i  would  urge  upon  the government that to dispel the fear of the affected people these four words as far as possible  should  be  deleted  from  this  legislative  document  i  would  like  to  know from the hon minister whether our blood banks in the states are equipped enough to screen the blood which is not tainted with or which is not infected with hiv and aids    the  2006  draft  of  the  bill  was  comprehensive    it  not  only  protected  the rights  of  plhiv  but  also  the  mostatrisk  population    the  bill  does  not  have elements  regarding  the  outlines  of  policy  change  funding  and  normalisation  of hiv plus individuals in society  the bill has severe drawbacks in terms of fiscal responsibility    the  bill  provides  for  the  establishment  of  only  one  ombudsman  however we need more  ombudsmen   again tuberculosis is  the  leading cause of death for people with hiv worldwide  however tb can be cured but i have found nothing in this legislation in regard to my contention about tb

__label__for   there  are  certain  problems  associated  with  hiv infection  the treatment of the disease per se and the combination is very costly  therefore the burden  lies on  the  government  and  the patient   the  third  thing is the discrimination against the person affected by the disease   the fourth thing is that  the  person  gets  infection  not  due  to  his  fault  but  for  various  other  reasons  two  decades  ago  india  was  considered  a  hotspot    initially  in  states  like  tamil nadu  maharashtra  and  andhra  pradesh  many  cases  were  detected  but  all  the state governments with the help of the central government took all the measures to control the disease  india has demonstrated that the course of an epidemic can be  reversed  by  public  education  mass  awareness  and  widescale  availability  of testing  and  treatment    the  present  bill  lists  the  various  ground  on  which discrimination  against  hivaffected  persons  and  those  living  with  them  is prohibited    i  feel  this  should  be  executed  on  the  groundlevel  without  any compromise    the  union  government  should  provide  adequate  financial  and logistic  support  to  the  state  governments  to  take  effective  measures  to  prevent further  spread  of  hiv  or  aids      for  the  first  time  the  bill  brings  together  a human  rights  perspective  to  public  health  and  makes  antiretroviral  treatment  a right of hivaids patients  this bill will ensure that in future that no indian has to struggle for diagnosis or treatment  the bill also mandates that no person can be compelled to disclose their hiv status report except with informed consent and if required by a court order  the bill intends to ensure that those living with hiv do so with dignity and respect enjoying all their rights as citizens    dr  ratna  de  nag  india has the third largest hiv epidemics in the world  after  south  africa  and  nigeria    the  bill  highlights  the  provisions  to safeguard  the  rights  of  the  people  living  with  hiv  and  affected  by  hiv    it  also lists  various  grounds  on  which  discrimination  against  hiv  positive  persons  and those  living  with  them  is  prohibited    alongside  the  aim  is  also  to  enhance  the legal  accountability  and  establish  formal  mechanism  for  redressing  grievances  the  prevention  programme  does  not  look  at  how  womens  bodies  are  different from men  the bill fails to include provisions for the protection of people who are most  vulnerable  to  contracting  the  disease  for  instance  people  frequently  using contaminated  injection  equipment    the  stigma  attached  to  hiv  aids  victims  in india  remains  intense  and  is  not  only  confined  to  social  obstacles  but  economic too  the chief minister of west bengal has initiated a programme called muktir alo for skill development and vocational training for the sex workers

__label__callforaction __label__for   on  behalf  of  telugu  desam  party  we wholeheartedly support this bill and congratulate the minister for bringing forward a lot of historical bills like the ones on mental healthcare etc  before aids there is  another  condition  which  is  called  hiv  positive    once  a  person  is  tested  hiv positive  for  him  to  develop  aids  it  may  take  10  years  to  20  years  and  in  some cases he may not even get aids  most of the patients of aids suffer from chronic malnutrition  and  under  nutrition    most  of  the  symptoms  and  signs  of  aids  just mimic tuberculosis  a big debate is going on whether aids is a separate disorder as  district  from  tuberculosis  or  it  has  only  to  do  with  the  sexually  transmitted diseases    if  that  is  so  let  us  call  it  sexually  transmitted  diseases  why  do  we label it separately as aids and make the patients suffer from stigma  i definitely support this bill which has excellent provisions    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  commend  the  efforts  of  the government and the hon minister for coming up with this bill  the bill seeks to prevent and control the spread of hiv and aids prohibits discrimination against persons with hiv and aids provides confidentiality with regard to their treatment etc   the  bill  lists  various  grounds  on  which  discrimination  against  hiv  positive persons and those living with them is prohibited  the bill requires that no person shall  be  compelled  to  disclose  hisher  hiv  status  except  with  hisher  informed consent and if required by a court order  district ganjam in odisha is known as the  topmost  hiv  and  aids  prone  district  in  the  country    there  are  no sophisticated hospitals to check this fatal disease and no jobs are created in those areas  to  minimize  the  migration  of  labourers    reports  say  several  patients  in madhya  pradesh  and  elsewhere  have  refused  to  take  free  medicines  and  other services  owing  to  the  fear  that  linking  that  aadhaar  number  will  reveal  their identity and expose them  i would request the hon minister to give clarity on this aspect as to how the government intends to deal with this situation    
__label__callforaction __label__for   like  many  of  my  other colleagues  i  also  congratulate  the  hon  minister  for  bringing  out  a  wonderful legislation    in  fact  we  believe  that  prevention  is  better  than  cure    the  more vulnerable  group  is  women  and  children  who  need  a  special  focus    we  do  not have comprehensive coordinative efforts on part of the state governments and the central  government    this  only  can  result  in  effective  control  of  the  disease    i think  we  have  to  give  special  attention  to  the  female  sex  workers  particularly  at few places like mumbai and kolkata we need to have a special programme both in  terms  of  awareness  and  treatment  for  them  denial  either  for  the  treatment  or for  other  things  should  also  be  made  a  criminal  offence    instead  of  putting  the responsibility  of  ombudsman  on  to  the  state  governments  the  government  of india  should  take  its  responsibility    at  least  in  big  establishments  having  more than  100  people  some  incentive  may  be  given  to  the  companies  which  appoint exclusive nodal officers so that the awareness could be created and some redressal mechanism  could  be  evolved  in  the  company  itself    insurance  is  extremely essential and it has to be made compulsory and the premium has to be paid by the government for the simple reason that most of the victims are poor and illiterate   india has the lowest allocation in the world for health as a percentage of gdp  we should  give  more  priority  to  education  and  health    penal  action  should  be  taken against  the  doctors  who  deny  treatment  and  also  against  those  people  who  are responsible for stocking the drugs but do not do so  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  at the outset let me say that we fully support the bill and i also congratulate the hon health minister who has brought this bill which was pending for a long time  i also take this opportunity to thank him  on  behalf  of  my  government  for  allotting  the  aiims  to  telangana  state    i would also urge upon the government to give financial sanction for the aiims in this budget only  aids affects the body the mind and the social status  most of the patients are from the lower and  middle income groups they are  made to run from  one  hospital  to  another    various  excuses  and  reasons  are  given  not  to  give treatment  this bill will effectively deal with it as it has punishment provisions for people who avoid rendering services for these people that is the most important aspect of this bill which i wholeheartedly welcome  every master health checkup has  a  hiv  test    every  diagnostic  centre  and  hospital  should  take  the  precaution that  people  who  come  for  routine  and  regular  health  check  up  also  need  to  be informed about all the tests  most of the times we see social tensions and violence after the marriage  i am finding fault with those who know about hiv but do not disclose it to the family of the innocent girl or boy  that is absolutely a crime and there should be a provision for punishment  the punishment should be much more than what we have provided in this bill  ombudsman job is very nice  most of the time people cannot go to the court and file a case  any institution engaging more than 25 people or a 50 bed hospital should have the ombudsman  i would like to add  a  provision  here  to  the  effect  that  compensation  shall  be  paid  to  the  positive person if he undergoes mental stress because of the denial of the treatment  with good nutrition we can prolong death and in some cases even prevent it  not only hiv  aids  is  also  preventable    with  these  words  i  wholeheartedly  support  the bill    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  this is one of the very good bills drafted  by  the  ministry  of  health  and  family  welfare    so  i  would  like  to congratulate  the  hon  minister  for  having  brought  forward  this  bill    there  is  a social stigma attached to this disease  that has been removed by the provisions of this  bill    there  is  a  clause  in  the  insurance  policies  which  excludes  hiv    my request to the hon minister is this clause should be removed because that person who has taken that health policy or the life policy should not be discriminated on the basis of hiv infection  secondly if a couple is hiv infected and their health status is good they should be given an opportunity for adoption  there is a need to waive  the  consent  clause  for  conducting  hiv  tests  in  cases  when  the  patient  is suffering from severe  medical problem not responding to treatment  it should be made mandatory in every hospital to have  a ventilator and a hemodialysis for the hiv  patients    today  what  is  important  in  the  country  is  educating  the  youth educating the  schoolgoing  children  about  these diseases   many  a  times  we  hold the hospital responsible if the data is leaked about any  hiv infected person  my request  is  that  instead  of  holding  the  hospital  responsible  we  should  hold  the person who has leaked the data and he should be punished  there are many cases where even doctors and staff have been infected with hiv in the course of saving the lives of the patients so i think in such cases compensation should be given to the doctor or the staff who has got infected with this  health related premarriage couselling should be stressed  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   this  is  a  very  important  subject    i  do  not  find  the financial memorandum and the statement of objects and reasons in the bill  the hon  supreme  court  of  india  has  directed  the  central  government  to  give  art medicine to all hiv victims  the government has said that the art medicine for each patient would cost around rs28500  if we cannot give that much of amount for the victim of hiv how can we cure the patients in this country  we have seen 50  per  cent  reduction  in  the  number  of  new  hiv  infection    the  total  estimated hiv affected persons in our country are 208 million as per a report of 2011  what steps have been taken in our country to manufacturer generic antiretroviral drug in our country  it is a good bill  hiv is very much influencing our population  it is also  influencing  our  gdp  and  economy  this  bill  aims  to  end  this  epidemic  by 2030    this  bill  has  been  drafted  to  safeguard  the  rights  of  the  people  who  are affected by hiv  in my state of kerala we have seen that the rehabilitation of an hiv affected person is very difficult  the education of the hivaffected persons and their children is very much difficult in schools the bill also aims to enhance access  to  health  care  services  by  ensuring  consent  and  confidentiality  for  hiv related testing treatment and other clinical results  i think not only the government but the entire nation should be involved in awareness programmes  then only we can create a situation for the betterment of hivaids affected persons  the state and central government should ensure prevention of spread of hiv and aids and antiretroviral and access to welfare schemes especially for women and children  the hiv patients are not getting proper medical treatment in our hospitals this is something  very  alarming  i  think  government  should  come  out  with  some financial  support  to  the  states  to  ensure  protection  of  the  hiv  patients  and  their rehabilitation and treatment in their respective states    
__label__defect __label__allegation __label__callforaction __label__against   i  would  like  to  draw  the attention of the hon minister towards two or three points  first is that an estimated 3609 students who are still pursuing the courses from the institution or like to go for job hunting are uncertain about their degree status  what is the present status of those deprived students  what effective measures are the government is going to  take  to  regularize  those  students  so  as  to  get  their  diplomas  and  degrees  second is about poor quality of training material no money for factory visits and irregularities  in  admissions  and  placements    these  are  some  charges  that  fddi students  have  leveled  against  the  authorities    the  footware  design  and development  institute  was  supposed  to  have  been  made  the  centre  of  excellence but instead of strengthening it with the latest market industrial studies and research had  development  the  government  has  converted  it  into  mere  money  making  or money  minting  ordinary  college    even  they  have  alleged  that  fees  by  the  fddi management  were  charged  irrationally    the  average  placed  salary  instead  of increasing  have  gone  down    i  would  like  to  request  that  the  government  should ensure supply of raw hide and skin to the industry  i would also request for setting up one leatherrelated industrial development board   
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   the footwear  design  and development  institute  bill  seeks  to  declare  this  institute  as  a  institute  of  national importance  but  as  per  todays  requirement  at  least  10  more  branches  of  such institutes should be opened across the country and one of them should be opened in bihar    we  can  produce  skilled  human  resource  through  these  institutes    the leather  industry  is  growing  by  leaps  and  bounds  worldwide  so  we  need  trained skilled artisans to keep pace with this industry and this would also boost our export from  the  country  which  is  very  less  as  of  now    this  industry  causes  much pollution so the government needs to take care of this aspect    mostly small and medium  traders  are  engaged  in  this  business  and  their  economic  condition  is  not very good so they are unable to set up treatment plants for the purpose  therefore the  government  should  come  forward  and  set  up  treatment  plants  to  combat  the problem  of  pollution  arising  out  of  this  industry    we  are  still  using  traditional machines in this industry so there is a need to provide economic assistance to this sector for upgradation of technology because todays world is using stateoftheart technology    if  the  quality  of  our  leather  products  would  be  good  then  it  would naturally boost our export  along with this we need to impose a ban on imports from china in this sector

__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   leather  industry  is  a  very  old industry and the history bears testimony to it that this industry has been providing employment to lots of people in the various parts regions and villages since  time immemorial  but it is unfortunate that this vocation was confined to some castes only earlier which were looked upon as backward classes and this was the darker aspect  of  this  vocation    the  footwear  design  and  development  institute  bill  is definitely such a step that is viewed as the need of the hour of the day  india is the third biggest market of footwear  hence it would be difficult for us to stand in this age  of  competitive  market  if  we  continue  to  follow  our  traditional  ways  in  this sector    it  is  estimated  that  this  business  will  be  worth  2202  billion  by  the  year 2020    so  these  institutes  and  educational  institutes  are  mandatory  to  face  the  global competition wherein we may provide education to our children  on the basis of modern technology  i feel that government should take firm decision to secure and  strengthen  the  future  of  students  having  technical  education  and  i  am  of  the opinion  that  through  these  institutes  we  would  definitely  achieve  the  target pertaining to skill development and employment

__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  first  of  all  the  need  for  giving  the  stature  of  institute  of  national  importance  is something to which i would like to draw the attention of every hon member  this institution  has  an  allindia  presence  and  has  strived  hard  to  provide  very  good quality content of curricula  although it is observed by some of the hon members that  the  courses  were  very  charged  in  the  sense  of  the  fees  as  compared  to  many other  institutions    in  this  regard  i  would  like  to  say  that  the  course  is  selffinanced    i  am  not  saying  that  the  capital  expenditure  for  building  the  institutes will be taken from the students not at all  it means that the courses fee would be taken  from  the  students  and in that it is  fully  selffinancing  since  the nature of the course has been such and the job opportunities have been so very well knit the cost of the course has never deterred students from coming and joining  if we do not give that kind of a modern skill that skill which is very much linked with tastes and fashion we are not going to be able to have the better manpower  as we are aware  that  local  tanning  things  like  natural  residues  have  been  used  in  india  and today  indias  tanning  techniques  are  considered  to  be  very  good    international shoemakers  or  international  leather  product  makers  have  always  wanted  indian rawmaterials  in tamil nadu there is a lot of leather which is being tanned using kadukkai  which  is  also  considered  to  be  environmentfriendly    so  this  countrynot today but over the centuries has had leather tanning and it has given a steady flow  of  leather    that  has  never  obstructed  our  own  cow  protection  movements about which each one of us will have to be proud of and that has been a part of our freedom movements call  this country has given legitimate leather for the leather industry and that would continue  similarly with regard to women   i just want to underscore  the  point  that  in  the  existing  seven  campuses  the  malefemale  ratio between students is almost at equal  so women students have been given enough attention  and  place  in  our  campuses    there  will  be  enough  representation  of women  in  the  centres    as  regards  reservation  i  would  state  that  100  per  cent existing  laws on  reservations  for scs sts bcs  will  be  implemented  even  in the fddi  it would not be any different from any other institute in india   with regard to admission policy the running seven centres are admitting students on the basis of a common all india selection test the caist  similarly there has been a lot of voice about skill and skill imparting  i would like to add other than the courses which give degrees certificates and diplomas there are 96 centres in the country which are called training centres which train trainers  they are not only in those places  where  the  institutes  of  fddi  exist  but  also  in  places  in  states  where  the institute does not exist  with regard to opening of new institutes  at the moment we do not expect to expand more than 12 at this stage  we would like to limit it at 12 and prove our standards  we would try as much as possible when we design the contents  or  the  recruitment  or  the  campus  activities  to  involve  the  inputs  which each one of members had given us  the bill was passed

__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__for  the government will have to increase the staff strength in the income tax department to properly implement this act because they are under staffed presently  it will be easy to curb benami transactions through digitization because  it  would  lead  to  trace  such  transactions    the  deadline  for  declaring undisclosed  income  is  30th  september    this  will  help  in  registering  benami transactions  in  the  name  of  real  owner    moreover  people  have  to  pay  tax  at  the rate of 45 percent on such income this would significantly increase the revenue of the government  but this has to be taken care of that the immunity which is being given  should not  be violated  because  there  are  apprehensions  in  the  minds of  the people that the income tax department might reopen their cases in future  the hon finance  minister  should  pay  attention  to  this  fact  also    once  this  act  is operationalised  it  would  definitely  increase  revenue  to  the  exchequer  of  the government   
__label__defect __label__allegation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  support  this  bill  with  certain reservations  major  recommendations  of  the  standing  committee  have  not  been taken  into  consideration  they  would  have  improved  the  bill  this  is  my  first observation black money is a menace to the indian economy and benami deals are one of the major reasons for the proliferation of black money in a big way so if we  want  to  restrict  and  prohibit  the  generation  of  black  money  definitely  the benami transactions should be dealt with in a very strict  manner the original bill benami transaction prohibition act has passed in 1988 even after 27 years no rules  have  been  framed  under  this  act  it  shows  that  the  governments  were  not sincere  in  the  operationalisation  of  the  benami  law  therefore  i  congratulate  the hon  finance  minister  at  least  this  time  this  bill  has  come  before  the  house  for consideration and we are going to pass this bill also  a very good mechanism is put  in  place  and  a  wellestablished  procedure  is  also  there    but  there  are  some clarifications  which  i  would  like  to  seek    the  first  clarification  is  regarding  the application  of  code  of  civil  procedure    section  11  and  section  19  are  totally contradictory  the adjudicating authority shall not be bound by the code of civil procedure as per section 11 of the proposed amendment bill  section 19 is totally reverse to this section  it says that the authority shall for the purpose of this act have  the  same  powers  as  are  vested  in  a  civil  court  under  the  code  of  civil procedure  1908  while  trying  a  suit    therefore  the  adjudicating  authority administrator etc are having all these powers  so the adjudicating authority and authorities  under  the  act  are  not  bound  by  the  cpc  as  far  as  the  procedure  is concerned    but  as  far  as  the  powers  are  concerned  we  are  entitled  to  all  the powers  similarly the same situation is there in regard to section 40 clause 1 and clause 2  as per clause 1 of section 40 the appellate tribunal shall not be bound by  the  procedure  laid  down  by  the  code  of  civil  procedure  1908  but  shall  be guided  by  the  principles  of  natural  justice    clause  2  of  section  40  says  that  the appellate  tribunal  shall  for  the  purpose  of  discharging  its  functions  under  this act have the same powers as were vested in a civil court under the code of civil procedure  1908    therefore  they  are  not  bound  by  the  procedure  which  is  being laid  the second clarification is regarding the appeal before the high court that is under clause 493 4 and 5  it says that if the high court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in that case it shall formulate that question  i think for the first time in the history of indian legislation we are restricting the powers  of  the  high  court    that  question  only  will  be  argued  and  decided    the high  court  is  having  inherent  powers  and  discretionary  powers    how  can  we restrict the high court that it should adjudicate only on the question of law  it is an  admitted  fact  that  the  high  court  will  entertain  an  appeal  only  if  there  is  a question  of  law    another  clarification  which  i  would  like  to  seek  is  regarding section  58    an  exemption  is  given  here  again  to  the  definition  of  benami transaction  what is a benami transaction  almost all the benami transactions are in the name of religious and charitable trusts  the fourth point on which i would like to seek  clarification  is  section 59   the power of the  central  government to issue instructions directions and orders to the authority is very interesting  what are  the  areas  where  the  directions  are  given    is  a  judicious  mind  applied  in  this provision  provision  made under section 593 is a very strange provision  the adjudicating  authority  should  be  independent    why  should  the  central government  issue  direction  and  instruction    i  am  only  seeking  clarification  on section 59 operationalisation of this act definitely depends on the political will of the government to curb benami transactions and black money     
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  would  like  to  congratulate  hon prime minister and finance minister for bringing in an amendment after a lapse of 28  years    this  is  really  a  very  important  bill  brought  in  before  the  lok  sabha  today corruption is the commonly used word in our country  people are resorting to corruption  to get  their  work done  and they  have  completely  sidelined the  right course  people are giving bribes because they avoid paying so many taxes levied under  our  taxation  system    and  moreover  it  has  become  very  difficult  to  earn money honestly and earn a livelihood easily nowadays most of the black money generated in this country is being invested in the real estate  black money invested in this sector is not disclosed before the government authorities  people are of the opinion that if they have to pay 55 per cent tax on their hard earned money to the government  then  why  be  honest    so  there  is  a  need  to  bring  comprehensive change in the taxation system  protection should be provided to those people who are honest  the hindu undivided family has been well defined in this bill and it will  provide  relief  to  the  common  people    again  there  is  a  need  to  curb  the tendency  of  threatening  the  common  people  by  the  income  tax  officials  restrictions should be imposed on generation of black money through this bill and protection must be provided to those who are honest    
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   this bill introduced by the hon  finance  minister  will  definitely  put  curb  on  benami  transactions  to  some extent but we need a comprehensive bill to prevent the inflow and outflow of black money  and  we  need  to  bring  back  the  black  money  stashed  abroad  and  for  this stringent  provisions  should  be  made  in  the  bill    big  businessmen  invest  black money  in  real  estate  ingeniously    black  money  is  also  invested  in  the  film industry    there  should  be  a  limit  as  to  how  much  property  one  should  have    a very few people have lots of property while a major chunk of population is dying due to starvation  people are investing black money in purchasing large tracks of land  because  they  know  that  after  20  years  they  will  get  50  fold  returns  from  it  thus people invest their black money in an ingenious way  i therefore request the hon minister to kindly pay attention to these aspects also    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   the  benami  transaction prohibition act was enacted in 1988 to curb the tendency of benami transactions across the country  but it is also true that this objective of the government was not fulfilled because there were various shortcoming in it  now after removing these shortcomings  this  bill  has  been  brought    as  per  the  economic  survey  many economists are of the opinion that 70 per cent wealth of the country is concentrated in  the  hands  of  only  1015  per  cent  people  and  in  the  last  70  years  rich  have become  richer  and  poor  more  poorer    the  main  reason  behind  this  fact  is  that black money generated in this country have been stashed in certain other countries and benami properties were purchased here  i feel that after the passage of this bill this trend is going to end in this country and disparity between poor and rich will also come to end  i would like certain clarifications from the government  there is  a  need  to  bring  certain  amendments  in  income  tax  act  also there  are  certain people in the society who wish to transfer their property to their relatives and what is  the provision  in  those  cases   another point  is  that  in  our  country  various  land are owned by gods and few lands of gurudwara sahib are owned by guru granth sahib also  in this regard clarifications must be given in this bill so that there is no confusion left  i feel that comprehensive clarification should be given in this bill  
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   this  bill  had  been  brought  earlier  by  the upa  government  but  because  it lapsed it  has to  be  reintroduced today  both  in rajya  sabha  and  in  lok  sabha    today  the  question  arises  as  to  why  are  we supporting this bill  the earlier 1988 act had a blanket prohibition that this is a benami  transaction  defined  hereunder  and  this  cannot  be  allowed  and  this  is banned   but there  was no  detailed  legislation we  did not  know  who is going  to investigate  who is going to go after a benami transaction  so i appreciate the move  of  the  government   now we  have  proper  authorities proper investigating officers  in  initiating  investigations  the  approving  authority  an  administrator  and the adjudicating authority  few issues that i feel have created some confusion in my mind is that in section 531 which says that any person who is in violation of provisions  of  this  law  shall  be  prosecuted  with  rigorous  punishment  etc    when you say any persons the question that arises is who is that person  i hope the hon finance minister would elaborate on that  secondly and most significantly where this  government  is  consistently  talked  about  cooperative  federalism  i  do  not somehow understand why one the property is confiscated why should it vest in the central  government  and  not  in  the  respective  state  governments  where  those properties are today situated  
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  the bill which is lying dormant for 27 years has been brought today for the introduction and also to pass this shows the will of the government  i would like to stress only on two or three points  this bill  has  been  brought  to  eradicate  benami  transactions    but  here  everybody  has mentioned about property only whereas there are many assets a person can create through benami transactions  secondly in any case executor and judge cannot be the  same  person    similarly  in  the  matter  of  benami  transactions  one  can  appeal from  appellate  tribunal  to  high  court  and  supreme  court  also      sometimes  it takes a long period of 30 to 40 years to dispose of the cases  it is my request that there should be a time limit  there should be provision of providing incentives in this bill if a property worth 100 crore rupees is revealed then it would be better to provide  10  to  20  per  cent  incentives  in  this  case    apart  from  this  geo  tagging should  also  be  completed    at  last  i  would  like  to  say  that  honest  should  be protected and those who are guilty must be punished    
__label__for   in  our  country  it  has  become  a common  trend  to  buy  properties  make  transactions  dabble  in  shares  purchase vehicle through benami transactions  in some of the cases property is immediately transferred  by  a  person  in  the  name  of  any  member  of  his  family    it  is  only  to hoodwink the government  i would like to compliment the government that it has endeavour  for  making  this  bill  more  stringent  by  bringing  in  comprehensive amendments  in  the  benami  transactions  prohibition  act  1988    most  of  the black  money  is  invested  in  the  real  estate  sector    i  would  like  to  bring  to  the cognizance  of  the  government    that  there  is  a  provision  in  this  bill  that  right  to confiscate  any  type  of  property  will  vest  with  the  central  government  whereas land  and  property  are  state  subjects    so  there  is  a  need  to  rope  in  the  state governments  in  this  whole  process    no  time  limit  has  been  provided  regarding filing of appeal by any person in appellate tribunals  there should be atleast three months window for approaching the high court in this regard  i do not feel that mere by making provisions  for six months jail and 25 per cent penalty will make this  act  stringent    government  should  have  absolute  rights  over  confiscated property    inquiry  should  also  be  made  with  regard  to  the  high  officials  and  the subordinate staff who have attained superannuation    shri  c  n  jayadevan  the  benami  transactions  prohibition amendment bill 2015 has been brought by making comprehensive amendments to the  benami  transactions  prohibition  act  1988  and  to  deal  with  benami transactions effectively  we know that many of the politicians and bureaucrats in the  country  are  amassing  property  worth  more  than  their  legal  income  in  benami names    i  think  this  bill  will  help  to  check  this  menace  to  a  great  extent  if implemented  properly    the  committee  had  also  noted  that  benami  transactions could  be  preempted  and  eliminated  by  digitalization  of  land  records    the committee  stated  that  since  land  is  a  state  subject  under  the  constitution  rights over confiscated properties should vest with the state governments instead of the central government  so i would like to know what is the governments reaction to these issues    shri ck sangma the first point that i would like to say is that unless and until there is proper coordination between the centre and the state it  will be difficult for this act to be actually implemented at the grass root level  second we are  a  sixth  schedule  area    being  a  sixth  schedule  area  the  land  belongs  to  the clan the land belongs to the headman  the land does not belong to any individual  in this particular act there is no provision to allow the clan to be exempted from this law  i think in north east most of the tribals are exempted from income tax  it is a wonderful scenario for anybody who wants to do benami  therefore these kinds  of  situations  need  to  be  considered  when  we  pass  this  bill    another important  issue  is  that  we  have  porous  borders  with  bangladesh    a  lot  of counterfeit  money  is  coming  in    all  i  am  saying  is  that  the  central  government must respect the sentiments of the tribal people and at the same time ensure that the act is implemented in true spirit  the last point which i would like to mention is that  the  government  must  make  some  provisions to ensure that the powers  are not misutilized under this act   
__label__appreciation __label__for   several  members  have  laid stress on a point that acting on the recommendations of the standing committee a fresh  bill  should  have  been  brought  instead  of  bringing  an  amendment  to  the original act of 1988  so if we had accepted the recommendation of the standing committee    repealed  the  1988  act  and  recreated  a new  law  in  2016 that  would have  been  granting  immunity  to  all  people  who  acquired  properties  benami between  1988  and  2016    obviously  the  acquisition  cannot  take  place  but  the penal provisions of the 1988 act also would have stood repealed  when a new act with similar provision would have come it could only apply for a penal provision to properties which are benami entered into after 2016  this move would not have been  in  larger  public  interest  particularly  if  large  amounts  of  unaccounted  and black money has been used to transact those transactions  therefore prima facie the argument looks attractive that there is a 9section law and you are inserting 71 sections  into it   as  far  as  penalizing  the guilty  people  is  concerned the  required machinery  is  being  made  operative  under  the  present  amendment  for  punitive action    moreover  whistleblowers  need  not  get  any  protection  under  this  bill because  we  have  a  specific  law  for  them  which  across  laws  applies  to  all whistleblowers  when a whistleblowers gives any information he gets protection under  the  whistleblowers  act      as  far  as  making  benami  transaction  a  noncognizable offence is concerned it has been made noncognizable because we do not  want  multiple  agencies  to  come  and  harass  the  people    the  object  is  not  to harass  them  but  the  object  is  that  there  must  be  prosecution  if  he  has  violated  a particular  law  furthermore  if  you  see  the  list  of  amendments  which  the government  has  circulated  amendment  nos  3  4  and  5  i  have  proposed  to  the hon  house  that  the  phrase  of  income  in  all  the  three  sections  wherever  it  is mentioned  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  standing  committee should be deleted and the word in the amended section would be known sources and not known sources of income  besides your suggestions regarding the right of representation through an authorized representative here also been incorporated in the bill  you then raised this whole issue of why we have these four stages that is  initiating  officer  the  acting  officer  the  adjudicating  officer  etc    we  have adopted these stages to check the misuse of power by any individual and to reduce the possibility of error   one important question which has been raised by several members  is  as  to  why  should  the  property  vest  in  the  central  government  why not  in  the  state  government    under  all  central  legislations  where  vesting  of property takes place it vests in the central government  at least i am not aware of  any  law  which  is  a  central  law  under  which  vesting  or  acquisition  takes  place but  the  property  rights  then  go  to  some  other  authority    a  legitimate  point  has been  raised  that  the  appellate  authority  has  not  been  given  a  specific  power  of staying  the  order  i  would  like  to  say    in  this  regard  that  when  an  appellate authority has a power to pass a final order the power of interim suspension of the order  which  is  inherent  in  that  power  of  appeal  irrespective  of  whether  it  is specifically  mentioned  or  not    so  far  as  the  issuing  direction  by  the  central government  is  concerned section  593  clearly  says  that  no  order  instruction  or direction under subsection i shall be issued which require the authority to decide a particular case in a particular manner  this law is not in conflict with the income tax  act  in  any  way    the  income  tax  act  deals  with  various  provisions  of taxation the powers to levy the procedures etc  this particular law deals with any benami  property  which  is  acquired  by  a  person  in  somebody  elses  name  to  be vested  in  the  central  government    so  the  two  acts  are  supplementary  to  each other  as  far  as  this  act  is  concerned    the  section  58  clearly  provides  that  the government  has  the  right  to  exempt  the  properties  registered  in  the  name  of  religious deities and religious organizations  a question has been raised that under section 53 who would be liable  is it the person who acquires the property or the person who sells the property  in this regard the language is very clear whoever enters into benami transaction and obviously both these people have entered into a benami  transaction  itself    the  last  question  was  with  regard  to  properties  in several  schedule  areas  which  are  covered  by  the  fifth  schedule  itself    this  act does  not  exempt  those  properties    but  that  exemption  would  be  available  in  the article  244  of  the  constitution    the  fifth  schedule  clause  5  clearly  says  that wherever those scheduled properties are the governor of that state has the power to exempt the operation of any central legislation to those areas  the bill as amended was passed     
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against  all that i wanted to say that as a member of the standing  committee  on  finance  we  had  eight  meetings  on  the  benami transactions bill and we gave a unanimous report in which we said that fresh law should be brought  i want to ask the hon minister that why is it that you chose to override the unanimous recommendation of the finance committee and go ahead with the bill  the intention of the minister to eradicate black money is good  but by  bringing  this  act  he  is  opening  the  path  to  hell  because  in  the  statement  of objects and reasons of the bill does not state that the purpose is to eradicate black money   this  act has  a  provision  for  confiscation under 271  and  it  is  vested in the  central  government  whereas  it  should  have  been  vested  in  the  state government which allocated land  lastly i think this will open a serious problem in  rural  areas  where  there  are  no  proper  land  records  and  there  are  cash transactions  moreover the existing income tax act has adequate provisions and teeth to deal with issues such as tax evasion and unaccounted income  therefore he should take back the bill today and go for a new bill   the  minister  of  finance  and  minister  of  corporate 
__label__appreciation __label__for   the  hon  finance  minister had  in  his  budget  speech  2015  said  that  we  are  going  to  present  a  very comprehensive benami transaction prohibition amendment bill in the house in order  to  tackle  the  problem  of  domestic  blackmoney    today  by  presenting  this bill  in  the  house  he  has  not  only  taken  a  big  stride  towards  fulfilling  that commitment but has also created history in doing so  the acts related to the issue which had been in force have proved to  be inadequate in provisions to tackle the problem    this  bill  very  clearly  defines  benami  transaction    it  also  clearly  lays down  the  parameters  for  those  entities  who  will  be  treated  as  benami  holders  as also those who will not attract the provisions of this act   the punishment of 03 years in the previous act has also been amended and a provision of sentence from 01  to  07  years  has  been  made  in  the  act    besides  there  is  also  a  provision  of penalizing the offender upto 25 per cent of the market value of the property  the amendment  act  also  seeks  to  provide  powers  of  civil  court  to  the  competent authorities  there is also a provision of appellate court  in conclusion i am of this opinion that the kind of law  matching global standards in respect of transparency and  accountability  brought  by  the  government  will  certainly  go  a  long  way  in tackling the problem of blackmoney    
__label__against     originally  the  benami  transactions  prohibition  act  was  enacted  in 1988 and had only nine sections and any person who wishes to acquire an asset or a  property  must  do  it  in  his  own  name  with  his  money    if  he  acquires  it  in  the name of somebody else then it is deemed to be a benami property  even though two judgements of the supreme court came this law has not been updated and put into effect  benami transactions are prohibited and the state will have the power to acquire  the  benami  property  and  that  the  person  who  enters  into  this  benami transaction is  liable  to be prosecuted  when  this law  was  framed it  was thought that  everything  else  would  take  place  by  virtue  of  rules    this  act  had  to  be operationalised  through  rules  and  the  rules  were  never  framed    the  reason  why we want to amend the 1988 bill because it was considered necessary that the old law  be  allowed  to  remain  and  the  new  amendments  be  inserted  into  the  old  law itself    the  amendment  bill  has  71  sections  because  we  want  the  bill  to  be operationalised from 1988 onwards  the standing committee among others gave a  recommendation  to  lay  down  as  to  what  are  the  exceptions  to  the  benami principles  one exception which the law provided for was properties held within an undivided hindu family  the second amendment was in the event of a trust trustee can hold the property as a fiduciary of the principal trust  so those would be exempted we also considered the issue of properties acquired through power of attorney  and  that  key  amendment  has  been  accepted  by  the  government    the principal  object  behind  this  bill  is  to  discourage  benami  transactions    it  is predominantly an antiblack money measure that any transaction which is benami is  illegal  and  the  property  is  liable  to  be  confiscated    i  commend  this  bill  for discussion and acceptance of the hon house    shri  sp  muddahanume  gowda initiating  said  benami transactions  are  detrimental  to  the  interest  of  this  nation  and  benami  transactions constitute  a  serious  offence  against  the  state  also    so  prohibition  is  needed  and prevention  is  also  required  equally    we  have  been  hearing  much  about  indian black money in foreign countries  but to our surprise we have got enormous and sufficient black money on our indian oil itself  the easiest way of keeping the illgotten  money  is  to  invest  it  in  landed  properties    we  have  been  seeing  that throughout the country a lot of valuable prime properties are being purchased by some people in the name of somebody else  in our country a lot of lands which are vacant and barren have been converted into banks of this black money  black money is invested to keep it safe and to escape from the clutches of law  this law is not only detrimental to the economy of this country but it is also detrimental to the  food  production  of  this  country    in  karnataka  a  nonagriculturist  or  a company cannot purchase or own agricultural land to prevent black money holders from investing this money in agricultural lands  if the aadhaar number the pan and  the  bank  account  number  is  linked  it  will  stop  generation  of  black  money  definitely people are prepared to come and inform the concerned authorities about benami transactions  but what is the law the government has enacted in this bill to protect the interest of the whistle blowers  i would like to know how an offence of serious nature can be treated as a noncognizable offence  principles of natural justice  require  and  demand  a  person  should  be  given  some  legal  assistance    but the  government  has  not  mentioned  anything  about  appearance  before  the adjudicating  authority    this  authorities  and  jurisdiction  and  procedural  aspect appear to be too high too heavy and too lengthy  the government have provided a provision for this appellate tribunal  the government have made provision to reintroduce    the  case  here  also  in  the  appellate  tribunal    that  means  the  original jurisdiction  still  exists  before  the  appellate  tribunal  which  is  not  correct   in  the appellate tribunal also you have not fixed any time limit  the seriousness of the whole  issue  the  concern  of  the  government  to  deal  with  these  cases  very stringently i think that will be taken away the way in which the provision is being made  to  drag  the  case  for  years  together    that  should  not  happen    the parliamentary  standing  committee  has  recommended  about  known  source  of income  that should not be there  it is only known sources  that should be there  sources are different from sources of income  known sources are the right words  in  spite  of  the  recommendation  of  the  parliamentary  standing  committee  that amendment has not been made  that is why that should be seriously looked into    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  the bill which has come up is the benami transactions prohibition amendment bill 2015  the government could bring a new  bill  the  standing  committee  of  finance  in  partii  of  its  28th  report  had recommended  for  bringing  a  new  bill    there  will  be  problem  in  appointing  the chairman of the adjudicating authority because the bill says that the senior most member will be the chairman and seniority of officers belonging to different cadres cannot  be  compared    i  fail  to  find  a  point  in  including  department  of  revenue everywhere  the bill proposes to create an appellate tribunal but i would like to ask  where  the  provision  for  preferring  an  appeal  is    if  an  order  is  passed  by  the adjudicating  authority  power  should  be  given  to  the  appellate  tribunal  to  pass an  interlocutory  order    it  should  be  ensured  that  a  person  gets  justice    in  rural areas and in case of illiterate persons it is very difficult to find the land deeds etc  in their  cases if the deeds are not  available then  care  should be taken to  see that those  properties  are  not  brought  within  the  scope  and  ambit  of  this  act    if  the property is not bought by tainted money or money from undisclosed sources then those  properties  should  not  be  brought  within  the  scope  and  ambit  of  this  act  except  certain  points  which  i  have  already  pointed  out  i  appreciate  the mechanisms that has been created through this bill     
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   the  bill  seeks  to  amend  the  benami transaction  act  1988    the  bill  seeks  to  amend  the  definition  of  benami transactions  establish  adjudicating  authorities  and  an  appellate  tribunal  to  deal with  benami  transactions  and  specify  the  penalty  for  entering  into  benami transaction  the bill also specifies certain cases which will be exempted from the definition of a benami transaction  in the exception to benami transaction as laid down in section 21 of the principal act  the expression out of known sources of income should be replaced by out of known sources so as to bring clarity in cases where loan funds which are not income are used as consideration for purchase of a property  and  not  be  kept  out  of  the  purview  of  the  bill    in  a  federal  setup  like india where land is a state subject it would be deemed appropriate that the rights of confiscated benami properties vest with state government instead of the central government    the  amendment  bill  is  likely  to  have  very  serious  impact  in  rural areas  where  because  of  large  number  of  cash  transactions  and  poor  state  of  land records  even  genuine  land  owners  may  find  it  difficult  to  establish  their  titles records  being  nontraceable    as  a  precaution  therefore  a  thorough  and  serious inquiry  by  the  initiating  officer  becomes  essential  before  the  matter  goes  to  the adjudicating  authority    the  time  taken  for  such  inquiry  should  therefore  be extended from the proposed period of thirty days to thirty months  time limit for disposing of the appeal by an appellate tribunal say within 2 years from the date of filling of the appeal should be fixed in the bill  the provisions are also silent on  the  role  of  whistleblowers  and  their  protection  which  would  be  important  to detect benami holdings  adequate provisions in this regard should be incorporated in  the  bill    in  the  proposed  bill  the  appointment  of  the  adjudicating  authority has been prescribed  in  clause  9  however  no such  mechanism  has been  provided for  appointment  of  the  initiating  officer  and  the  approving  authority    the proposed bill may therefore be restructured by inserting a chapter on authorities on the lines of income tax act so as to have greater clarity and avoid legal hassles  stress  should  be  laid  on  digitalization  of  land  record  and  its  regular  updation  efforts  should  be  made  to  deal  with  the  problem  systematically  to  the  extent possible  without  needless discretionary  intrusions    there should be  complete  coordination and intelligence sharing between different agencies  this aspect should be adequately reflected in the bill  the need of the hour is to exercise the existing powers judiciously and in a credible manner  the finance minister in his budget speech  2015  had  stated  the  purpose  of  the  bill  was  to  curb  the  generation  of domestic  black  money    however  the  standing  committee  found  that  the statement  of  objects  and  reasons  of  the  bill  was  silent  over  that  significant  aspect  the intent of the government should therefore be clearly mentioned in the statement of objects and reasons of the bill   
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  this act has been in vogue since 1988 but has it been able to hook any of the benami transactions  income declaration scheme has been launched this year  this bill contradicts that declaration scheme this bill is talking  about  benami  property  which  includes  movable  immovable  tangible  and intangible  how will the income tax officers have control over the black money which is going out of the country through hawala  income tax department alone cannot deal with this  there may be so many acts to deal with such actions like hawala etc  customs and excise department should also have been integrated so that  the  black  money  menace  is  tackled    the  people  who  are  embezzling  the money  are  actually  traitors of  the  country   this  bill is a  well intended bill but  i feel that this should be integrated with the hawala customs drugs etc   
__label__defect __label__against  this bill has been brought to curb the nuisance of illegal transactions that have been plaguing our country  most of the black  money  generated  domestically  is  due  to  real  estate  transactions    this  bill does not take into account such different cultural compulsions existing in different parts of the country  this bill has the provision to seize benami property and hand it  over  to  the  central  government    this  is  against  the  core  spirit  of  federalism since  land  is  a  state  subject    i  would  like  a  clarification  from  the  minister  on whether  passing  this  bill  would  lead  to  conflict  with  the  income  tax  act  1961  black  money  from  abroad  should  be  brought  back  to  stop  benami  transactions domestically  savings of the poor and sundry should not be taken away by shrewd and  fraudulent  persons    my  party  feels  that  this  is  an  incomplete  and  haphazard bill which needs to be relooked even though the standing committee has already scrutinized it    
__label__callforaction __label__for   this  bill  proposes comprehensive  changes  in  the  benami  transaction  prohibition  act  1988    it expands  the  definition  of  benami  transactions  establishes  an  adjudicating authority  and  an  appellate  tribunal    it  also  increases  the  penalty  for  those indulging  in  benami  transactions    we  welcome  this  bill  why  the  benami transactions  are  so  prevalent  i  think  it  is  obvious  that  one  has  to  hide  wealth earned  from  undisclosed  sources  there  is  a  big  difference  between  the  actual value and the government official prices we do not have  good identification and valuation  of  properties  and  entities  so  by  this  act  alone  however  well  it  is implemented  i  do  not  think  we  can  eliminate  benami  transactions  we  need  a gamut of reforms and we need those that will eliminate these factors that will aid and  facilitate  benami  transactions  i  am  glad  the  finance  minister  and  the government  has  taken  into  cognizance  and  the  government  is  simultaneously taking  a  series  of  systematic  steps  and  reforms  we  have  to  distinguish  these benami  transactions  as  predicate  offences  and  benami  transactions  as  primary crimes i have submitted an amendment to this bill in benami transactions where it  is  predicate  offence  the  land  should  go  to  the  central  government  benami transactions where the state government land was illegally allocated to somebody to  favour  somebody  then  it  should  go  back  to  the  state  government  if  it  is  an income  tax  evasion  and  the  benami  transaction  is  caught  then  it  will  go  to  the central government if it is corruption at the central government then i think the land in the benami transaction should go back to the central government we also need  to  take  cognizance  of  the  standing  committee  report  saying  that  the investigation  by  the  initiating  officer  should  be  completed  within  a  specific  time frame  it  is  better  if  time  frame  is  mentioned  information  technology  has  some problem  when  applied  to  detecting  benami  transactions  land  identification  land valuation  and  location  codes  should  be  there  for  this  purpose  standardization  of information relating to land deeds is required   
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  we want that benami transactions in the  case  of  property  should  be  totally  stopped  in  our  country    we  think  some loopholes  are  still  there  in  the  act    establishing  adjudicating  authorities  and appellate tribunals to deal with benami transactions and specifying the penalties for entering  into  benami  transactions  are  good  intensions    had  the  loopholes  in  the income tax act 1961 been plugged we would not need a new bill  sometimes an  individual  can  purchase  land  for  the  sake  of  the  family  and  he  may  sincerely honestly  gift  it  to  other  persons    in  that  case  what  would  happen  has  not  been described in the amendments  this loophole should be plugged  it is stated in the bill  that  the  confiscated  properties  will  be  vested  with  the  central  government that should go to the concerned state government  for initiating and completion of the cases there should be a fixed time limit  for furnishing information about land only 30 days time has been given  i think this can be extended  it should be integrated with aadhaar or pan card  benami transactions are taking place only to create black money to keep the black money for political purposes and also for creating  election  fund  of  political  parties    if  the  political  parties  and  political leaders keep away from benami transactions and not use black money for political purposes then only  benami  transactions can be stopped in  this  country  we  hope that this bill becomes a very strong law    
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  if black money and benami property is  not  wiped  out  honest  and  middle  class  person  cannot  indulge  into  election politics that is why i congratulate the government political parties do not want to touch these things the congress party might have brought this act originally but it did not utilize it this is the biggest example of political will such a law is the yardstick  of  change  that  is  brought  about  through  a  change  in  government  such decisions  shake  up  governments  as  the  persons  having  property  are  not  ordinary persons    aadhaar  numbers  should  be  linked  with  registry  so  that  if  i  have  ten properties this number will reflect all my ten properties and the remaining benami properties will be exposed one day or the other i feel that three things are a must in this regard such as linking of aadhaar number with registry will be an effective way to reveal the benami property the second measure is to make it mandatory to declare properties while filing income tax there is no mention in this bill about the properties of the mutt and the temples will the trust operating for thousands of years in which the name of any person has not been mentioned get protection i feel  that  it  should  be  kept  into  view  i  support  this  bill  congratulating  the government  it  will  be  a  history  before  the  coming  generation  that  the  thing initiated in the year 1882 has finally been settled in the year 2016    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   i  welcome  this  bill  the  bill  in  short  has three main areas one is the definition of benami transactions the second one is setting  up  of  appellate  tribunal  and  other  adjudicating  authorities  and  the  third one  deals  with  penal  provisions  in  spite  of  having  so  many  legislations  people with malign intention are finding loopholes and elbowroom in circumventing laws through unfair practices under income declaration scheme if a person declares his benami  properties  will  he  get  immunity  under  this  bill  it  is  a  big  question  i request  the  hon  minister  to  bring  an  official  amendment  in  genuine  transactions even in case of nonhuf families where name of elder member of the family who has partly or fully paid for the property does not occur as joint owner

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   this act was enacted in  1951  and  now  we  are  changing  a  very  small  provision  that  except  industrial alcohol all other alcohol mostly the ones that are consumed by human beings will be under the control of the states  if we see this amendment prima facie there is no reason for opposition to this bill  but my point is by perpetuating this process are we not continuing the licence raj  that obviously everybody wants to get rid of    so  it  is  time  the  central  government  decides  and  takes  positive  action  to relinquish the holding powers that it has which mess up the governance system of this  country    has  the  ban  by  the  states  really  helped  them  in  controlling  the consumption of alcohol  alcohol is available in plenty in all the states which have a ban imposed in those states  ban is something that i do not believe has actually helped society anywhere  so per se i support the bill  today by imposing ban on natural substances we have actually forced a lot of these people to move on to alcohol  i would suggest that the central government in totality should look at all the  laws  and  should  try  to  relinquish  too  much  of  reign  holding    they  should allow  states  to  develop  their  own  policies  abilities  and  strong  points  to  become prosperous  the central government should only play the role of a mediator or an arbitrator and not play the role of a big brother governing from the top

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for       the  amendment  is  very  specific    the amendment  is  very  small  that  the  alcohol  is  being  diverted  to  the  state government so that the full control of the state government should be there on it  it would be in conformity with the judgment of the supreme court and also ensure that  the  industries  engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  alcohol  meant  for  potable purposes shall be under the total and exclusive control of state in all respects   the bihar government has announced to ban alcohol in their state  but our experience is that wherever there is a ban on alcohol there is a lot of alcohol being produced and  supplied  illegally  by  mafias    so  if  it  is  kept  free  and  not  banned the  state government  will  also  get  money  in  the  form  excise duties  and  such incidents  of consuming spurious alcohol would also not happen in future  
__label__appreciation __label__for   be  it  providing  financial  rights  or  taxation rights to the states this act is going to strengthen federal structure of the country  had  this  bill  not  introduced  there  would  have  been  no  demarcation  between industrial alcohol and potable alcohol  i think this bill has brought a clarity in this matter    now  they  would  be  no  dispute  between  union  and  states  with  regard  to jurisdiction on this matter  all of us know that there are two types of alcohol one is used for human consumption and the other is used in the industries  this act has brought a  set  of  rules  and    a line  of demarcation  with regard to  development  and regulation  of  these  two  industries    the  passage  of  this  bill  will  lead  to  increase income of both union and states    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   this  bill  clearly  express  of  the  intention  of  the central  government  with  regard  to  finding  a  solution  to  dispute  between  union and states under federal system  earlier alcohol was under union government and some intoxic fermentation materials were under control of state governments but with the passage of this bill the state governments will get more powers and will be  able  to  set  up  distillery  their  own  units  and  manufacturing  units    the  state governments  will  also  be  able  to  deal  with  taxes  related  to  it    some  of  our colleagues were talking about ban on alcohol presence of mafia and police torture in some states but this bill has nothing to do with all this things i am sure this bill will not lead to give rise to mafia rather will put an end to mafia  we should trust the  state  governments  in  this  regard    i  will  make  an  appeal  to  all  the  state governments to take strong decision to eradicate this evil of alcohol addiction and create new sources of income in its place  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for       in  order  to  give  effect  to  the  supreme  court judgement and law commission observations we always make legislations here  why  do  not  we  make  a  legislation  suo  motu    it  appears  as  if  supreme  court  is dictating  us  and  we  are  running  the  administration  as  per  the  supreme  court directions  let us give an impression that the lok sabha is supreme  there is a lot of talk whether this alcohol should be part of state gst or central gst or igst  i do not  know  what  type  of benefits  the  state  government  will get  when  the  taxes are  not  being  levied  and  not  allowed  to  be  collected  from  the  state  government   another thing is that we have a lot of pollution problems in our country presently because of petrol and diesel emission  there is a strong proposal from the minister of petroleum and natural gas to allow the alcohol to be mixed with the petrol  as a result of which emissions will come down  it also gives a great relief to the sugar growing farmers  it will also go a long way in addressing not only the ecological and emission problems but it will also take care of the problems of farmers     
__label__defect __label__for   so  far  as  i  know  there  has  not  been any  discussion  on  alcohol  or  industry  related  to  it  since  1965    earlier  madhya pradesh used to get molasses from state of maharashtra as the state had its no sugar mills    but  maharashtra  government    had  adopted  a  policy  not  to  sell  a  grade molasses  to  other  state    though  the  madhya  pradesh  used  to  have  this  a grade molasses    but  on  paper  it  was  b  grade  molasses    as  i  was  student  of  science  i knew  that  if  alcohol  is  prepared  with  b  or  c  grade  molasses  it  would  increase percentage  of  methyl  alcohol  and  would  cause  deaths  to  those  who  consume  it  as  expected  number  of  the  incidents  of  death  took  place  at  that  time  czechoslovakia started liquor industry and even patronized it but later on it had to suffer a lot and the industry was closed there  therefore sooner or later we have to move towards deaddiction  
__label__callforaction __label__for     this  bill  seeks  to  amend  the  first  schedule  of  the industries  development  and  regulation  act  1951  to  exclude  the  production  of alcohol for potable purpose from the ambit of the said act   the bill confines to the supreme courts decision  i would like to ask the hon minister what its affect will be on taxation and other things  we are going to introduce gst and alcohol is one of the subjects not covered under it  whenever we amend any law we have to change it for few more years not for the present purpose only  so i would request the government that whatever amendment to a law is placed before the house it should  not  be  to  fulfil  only  the  direction  of  a  court  this  195  act  itself  gives  an advice  to  the  centre  to  prepare  a  council    so  i  would  like  to  know  from  the government whether the functioning of the council is up to the mark as effective functioning of the council is also very much required to establish the system in a smooth way

__label__allegation __label__against  the supercilious manner by which the bill has been introduced  is  simply  humiliating  the  parliamentary  system  of  our  country  more often than not this government is trying to hoodwink the parliamentary system of our  country  sometimes  by  resorting  to  ordinances  again  in  a  supercilious  and  a cavalier  manner  the  government  has  introduced  the  financial  resolution  and deposit  insurance  bill  and  i  think  that  this  kind  of  introduction  certainly undermines  our  parliamentary  system  therefore  i  am  opposing  the  introduction of the bill

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against  i  appreciate  the  hon  minister  that  he essentially  brought    in  the  amendments  proposed  and  passed  by  house  of  elders before the two houses aadhaar is a very essential issue this shows how we are moving from a state of affairs where in most of the cases citizens are required to comply voluntarily we are trying to make it compulsory clause 33 only demands a  clear  definition  of  national  security  what  is  the  problem  in  defining  the  word national  security  or  having  the  words  proposed  public  emergency  and    in  the interest  of  the  public  safety then  what  is the objection  you  are  saying  to  have  a oversight  committee  and  they  have  proposed  for  cvc  and  cag    both  are  the constitutional  bodies  this  house  must  agree  with  what  has  been  recommended by the rajya sabha and we should reject what the hon minister is proposing  
__label__appreciation __label__against   these are important amendments by the upper house of which the finance minister who is moving the bill himself is a  very  respected  and  senior  member      so  i  am  sure  he  respects  the  house  to which he belongs  all these amendments including the deletion of clause 15 seem very reasonable which our party the biju janta dal has been trying to implement in the  aadhaar  process  if  any  of  our  members  are  enrolled  in  aadhaar  here  i  can get their details by rs 50 per person  that is already available and this is there in the market  this  is a democracy and this is a country that loves freedom  i guess all  of  us  here  are  direct  beneficiaries  of  that  process  of  democracy    therefore  i would suggest like earlier the hon member did that let there be no hurry

__label__callforaction __label__for     there  were  broadly  two categories one is privacy and the other is identity risk  we agreed to support the bill  primarily    because  the  immediate  risks  are  much  lower  than  the  immediate benefits  and  for  our  state  the  immediate  benefits  are  veryvery  significant    i humbly request the finance minister to tell us the need for such urgency   
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for     provision  of transfer  policy  of  captive  mines  is  essential  because  if  some  planet  is  in  sick condition  banks  finances  are  also  involved  in  it  if  it  gets  closed      so    people would  become  unemployed  if  this  provision  is  not  being  made   trade  should  be simplified employment should be generated so it was felt necessary that transfer policy  should  be  given  to  captive  mining  lease    thus  this  amendment  has  been brought    last  time  when  an  amendment  in  the  act  was  brought  a  clause  was added in section 12 a wherein only those mines would be transferred which would be  auctioned    no  other  mines  would  be  transferred      so  we  are  opening  these mines    states  would  implement  this  and  provision  and  the  revenue  generated would to state exchequer  centre is providing this facility so that no plant should be closed and unemployment should not grow i would like to inform that nmet has  been  constituted    mining  department  is  trying  to  make  full  development  by way of exploration  there was a discussion about increasing land ceiling i would like to inform  you that there are some  minerals and areas where area needs to be increased  i am happy to inform that auction notice of 43 mines have already been issued    in  the  second  phase  auction  notice  of  42  mines  is  likely  to  be  auctioned soon  in this way 100 mines will be auctioned some more suggestions have been received  we will definitely consider these  the bill was passed   aadhaar targetted delivery of financial and other 
__label__callforaction __label__for    i am saying this because earlier the grant of mining  lease  was  based  completely  on  discretion  after  the  decision  of  the supreme court necessary amendments were carried out in the mines and mineral development  and  regulation  act  and  the  bill  was  introduced  in  2015  the necessary  provisions  were  made  by  replacing  section  11  with  a  new  section  11 which was introduced whereby the mineral concession was required to be granted only  through  auction  in  the  present  bill  section  12a  is  regarding  transfer  of mineral concession earlier the transfer of mineral concession was available only through  auction  but  the  captive  mining  leases  were  not  taken  into  consideration which  was  in  the  interest  of  development  of  the  mining  sector  therefore  the present bill is only with respect to including those mining leases where the captive mining  are  used  for  captive  purposes  but  the  proposed  licensingcummining leases are not made part of this bill it may  also be clarified whether this issue is also required to be taken into consideration or not   
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   the  bill  is  a  proposal  to  amend  the  mmdr act  1957    through  the  current  amendment  of  2016  the  government  wants  to insert  a  clause  that  will  allow  transfer  of  captive  mining  leases  granted  through routes  other  than  auction  this  will  facilitate  banks  and  financial  institutions  to liquidate  stressed  assets  to  my  mind  this  amendment  is  in  favour  of  inefficient mining  enterprises  rather  than  investing  in  technology  solutions  to  enhance efficiency   this  in  effect  means  that  the central  government can  make  arbitrary new rules on a case to case basis in allocation of mining leases  in the state where the private landowners have the right and a lot of hurdles are there there must be a  constitution  amendment  for  guaranteeing  proper  land  price  as  well  as  for protection of customs and traditions so that mineral wealth exploitation continues unhindered  by  private  landowners  rights    i  think  make  in  india  should  also include  the  exploration  of  mines  and  minerals  for  selfsufficiency  in  mineral requirement  as  well  as  for  export  for  generating  substantial  foreign  exchange    i want the minister to take note of this and have a proper examination  
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__for   the government  had  a  challenge  before  it  to  bring  in  transparency  in  mining  and promote it  this amendment will certainly bolstered the mining business as well as  production  of  minerals  in  the  country    there  has  been  a  transparency  in  the allocation  of  mines    today  regular  allocation  of  mines  is  going  on    the  state governments  are  getting  increased  value  of  their  minerals  and  the  illegal  mining has  also  stopped    thereafter  this  government  has  received  some  memorandum requesting  that  the  government  while  amending  this  act  has  inserted  a  clause 12a  thereby  banning    the  transfer  of  existing  mines  be  they  are  captive  or merchant  mines    as  per  the  provisions  of  the  act  only  those  minerals    can  be transferred mines of which were got through auction  this is really troubling the industry    owing  to  it  the  recovery  of  money  of  banks  invested  in  this  industry which is turning into npa and is getting difficult  therefore the government has brought  this  amendment  to  clear  the  transfer  of  such  captive  mines    the government has also defined the mineral lease    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  an amendment was actually effected in 2015 where substantive amendments were made and we had certain reservations regarding  those  amendments    so  again  some  amendments  have  been  proposed  when the amendment was given effect to last year the general perception that was created by this government was that now once the central government comes into operation they  will  be  auctioning  all  the  mines  more  transparency  will  be  there more  money will accrue and that money will also be transferred to the respective states    but  around  six  or  seven  states  had  certain  reservations  that  since  land belongs to the state whenever any lease has to be given whenever any mining is to  be  given  as  prospective  license  or  mining  lease  then  the  state  has  to  be  taken into  confidence      there  were  at  least  three  rulings  from  the  supreme  court  that had  established  that  the  state  governments  had  rights  over  mines  as  well  as  the lands  on  which  the  mines  were  located    our  party  agrees  with  the  proposed amendment  which  would  facilitate  transfer  of  captive  leases  alongwith  the respective end user industry  i would like to impress upon the minister that when the  lease  is  granted  by  the  state  government  its  transfer  should  also  be permissible  with  the  permission  of  the  respective  state  government  and  not otherwise    the  governments  should  not  ignore  the  state  government  because ultimately  it  is  with  the  help  of  the  state  government  that  mining  can  happen actually  the central government may also consider incorporating a provision to empower  the  state  government  to  permit  transfer  of  a  mining  lease  from  one government  company  to  another    the  amendment  provision  of  section  61b regarding  area  limit  is  causing  difficulties  in  increasing  the  limit  on  case  to  case basis  why  case  to case basis    so special  dispensation  in  area  limit  is  required for government companies  as the government companies play a very vital role in meeting the raw material requirements of the industries the area limit should be relaxed in respect of areas reserved for prospective or mining under section 17 a of the mmdr act  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  i would thank the hon minister for bringing this bill    the  government  has  overhauled  the  entire  procedure  and  bring  in  great amount of transparency therein  the government has made a provision to ensure that no assets can be transferred without auction  the government has also made a provision  that  if  the  tribals  are  impacted  adversely  then  they  will  be  given  all possible  help    this  will  no  more  happen  that  their  lands  are  acquired  and  they have  to  leave  the  forests    i  would  like  to  place  a  very  practically  point    after floods  the  land  of  farmer  is  filled  with  sand  and  the  land  does  not  remain cultivable  nor  can  the  farmer  clean  his  land  by  removing  that  sand    the government  should  made  a  provision  that  the  farmer  should  have  right  on  that sand filled land for 13 years till the land becomes cultivable again  as of now if the farmer takes out even a pan of sand  from his field then the process of mining sets in  the local officers also start exploiting him  the government should think over this issue    
__label__defect __label__allegation __label__callforaction __label__against  regarding the bill i would like to state that auction is necessary in the bill it has been stated that the central government has received a representation  from  industry associations  stating  that  the  subsection  has  caused difficulties  which  does  not  allow  merger  and  acquisition  of  a  company  having captive  leases    here  i  would  like  to  know  whether  we  are  working  for  the companies  and  the  corporate  or  whether  we  have  to  seek  a  balance  between  the interest  of  the  business  community  as  well  as  the  toiling  working  class  also  regarding  the  dumping  of  waste  i  want  to  say  that  it  has  created  quite  a  lot  of problems  and  lives  of  millions  of  people  are  in  peril    mines  are  owned  by  the industrial  houses corporate  millionaires   there  is  mafia  operating in  the  mining sector of india  the mining sector is one of the important sectors which is giving employment for millions and millions of people  but the labour laws which have to  be  implemented  at  the  grassroot  level  are  not  being  implemented    if  you  are saying  about  inclusive  growth  and  cooperative  federalism  then  the  state government  is  also  one  of  the  stakeholders  my  humble  request  is  that  a  bill whether it is a new bill or any amendment bill should be thoroughly looked into and  consultation  with  various  stakeholders  should  be  done  by  the  concerned departmentallyrelated  standing  committee    but  the  recommendations  of  the departmentallyrelated  standing  committees  are  not  being  accepted  by  the government    we  have  to  protect  the  prerogative  and  the  power  of  the departmentallyrelated  standing  committees  only  in  the  committees  we  can have  a  thorough  discussion  with  the  concerned  officials  with  the  trade  union leaders  with  tribal  leaders  and  also  with  various  stakeholders    so  their recommendations suggestions complaints and apprehensions have to come before us  my request is that even though this bill seems to be a small bill this bill has to be sent to the concerned standing committee and their recommendations should come before the house

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against       there  are  some  issues which i would like to bring before the notice of the hon minister sir now more penalties have been proposed but there is every possibility that whenever there is more  proposed  penalties  in  india  it  leads  to  rentseeking  behaving  of  the  bribes therefore this point needs to be addressed auctioning will be successful only if adequate quantity and quality of the mines and minerals available is assessed sir rehabilitation and resettlement is almost worst in india particularly in the mining sector similarly about the  royalty only  onethird  is being  collected there  is no reason why only onethird of the royalty is being collected this point may also be looked into presently the coal and lignite lease holders will be depositing 25 per cent  of  their  profit  after  tax  that  is  missing  here  it  is  a  gross  injustice  to  the concerned state whatever they are supposed to deposit they should also deposit it with the state government while auctioning if the quality and quantity as i was suggesting  is  not  assessed  and  undervalued  the  state  governments  will  be  at  a loss  because  the  revenues  will  come  down  if  it  is  overvalued  the  leaseholders will  be  badly  affected  so  this  also  needs  to  be  considered  the  interest  of  the leaseholders is not at all considered when you want to bring in more investment when you want to bring in  more technology a  minimum guarantee of returns for the investors needs to be considered therefore the balancing has to be done  
__label__callforaction __label__against      i  understand  that  the  main  idea  of the government in bringing this bill is to transfer the captive mining leases granted otherwise  through  auction  and  would  facilitate  banks  and  financial  institutions  to liquidate  stressed  assets  where  a  company  or  its  captive  mines  mining  lease  is mortgaged  i  do  understand  that  the  mines  and  minerals  act  is  with  the  central government  however  i  feel  that  before  any  action  is  taken  the  state governments  should  be  consulted  and  their  permission  should  also  be  taken because lands that are there also belong to the state governments   
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__for   the present bill seeks to eliminate the  shortcomings  being  felt    in  mineral  sector  since  earlier  the  proposed amendments  mainly  address  to  issues  namely  transfer  of  mining  lease  and procedural   simplification  earlier the transfer of mines which were not allotted through  auction  was  not  possible  the  government  has  made  the  provision  for enabling  the  transfer  of  mines  which  are  acquired  through  the  route  other  than captive mining or auction if we want to make the dream make in india a reality than  we  have  to  remove  obstacles  in  transferring  raw  materials  to  our  industries the  captive  mines  are  associates  with  users  projects  which  are  capital  intensive projects and provide employment opportunities we can neither be mere spectator nor  let  the  industry  suffer  on  account  of  procedural  obscurity  the  governments has simplified the procedure to me this will protect the interest of our financial institutions alongwith attracting investors we are also trying to save the interest of banks which are custodians of public money  whenever industrial unit other than bank fall sick and the industrialists are unable or hesitate to transfer it to someone else than it will remain sick unit through the present amendment we try to revive industries by encouraging new entrepreneurs  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for    in this  proposed bill an amendment has  been made to accord permission to captive mining lease that are otherwise not given on auction    the  mines  which  have  not  been  transferred  there  is  loss  of  production companies  did  not  repay  their  bank  debt  so  these  mines  were  on  the  verge  of closure and no employment was given in these mines   the government has taken a decision  to bring about an amendment in the law  even the state bank of india has  informed  the  department  that  several  companies  had  financed  through  their bank and through other banks private financing was also done but they could not pay  back  their  debt    similarly  by  the  provision  of  transfer  in  this  bill  business  would  be  made  easy  by  the  acquisition    amendment  in  section  3  would  bring provision  of  defining  the  leased  area  which  is  not  at  present    there  are  many mines which are with the people for 50 years and 90 years period  where there is no  plant  or  industry  established    but  they  have  a  mine  and  this  is  with  the provision that if they transfer it whether that industry will also become a part of it or  not    i  understand  that  there  should  also  be  a  provision  that  small  mines  and minerals  which  generate  employment  the  big  people  get  financial  help  through banks but small entrepreneurs and specially educated youth want to set up an small industry  so  they  should  get  facility    trade  regarding  minerals  should  flourish  there  is  mineral  wealth  in  our  country  but  we  are  not  making  proper  use  of  this mineral wealth  if we properly utilize this mineral wealth and provide employment through  it  our  income  shall  grow  and  new  employment  will  be  generated  and make in india will become successful  i support the bill   
__label__callforaction __label__against     two amendments have been brought by  rajya  sabha    the  first  amendment  is  relating  to  clause  9    at  the  time  of initiating  the  debate  i  had  raised  a  point  that  this  is  affecting  the  constitutional rights  of  the  tribal  people  provided  under  article  244  scheduled  v  and  vi  that has to be taken care of  we have also moved amendments but they have not been carried out by the government  i do appreciate that at least in the eldest house the rajya sabha the government have conceded to the demands of the elders  my submission to the hon minister as well as to the government is that please conced to  the  harmless  amendments  which  are  being  made  from  the  opposition  side  in lok sabha  the second amendment is regarding the district mineral foundation  now in rajya sabha this amendment has been come to clause 15 of the bill  the amendment  that  i  am    moving  is  that  the  word  exclusively  may  also  be  added immediately after shall work    
__label__callforaction __label__for   that  the  amendments  made  by  rajya sabha  in  the  bill  further  to  amend  the  mines  and  minerals  development  and regulation amendment act 1957 be taken into consideration   
__label__appreciation __label__for     the  mines  and  minerals  act  of  1957 has vested with centre to bring in measures for developing the mines  the present amendments  seek  to  give  more  say  to  the  state  governments  both  in  granting approvals  and  in  carrying  out  mining  operations    this  had  become  necessary because of innumerable litigations that had come in the way of using the potential of our minerals wealth at an optimum level  we support this bill    
__label__callforaction __label__for  at that time only i had said that if you had referred  the bill to the standing committee it would have been passed within 23  days  but  you  did  not  pay  any  heed  to  it  the  bill  was  sent  to  the  select committee by the rajya sabha and  amendments were made to it and it has come back for our consideration here any good suggestion by the opposition should be accepted in a functional parliamentary democracy the bill should be referred to the standing committee whether they belong to coal mining or any other subject if you had adopted this procedure it would have saved time and the bill also could have been passed therefore i would like to remind the same   
__label__callforaction __label__for   the  significance  of  the  two  chambers  in our  parliamentary  system  as  envisaged  in  our  constitution  is  once  again  being highlighted   the second point is that we should not compromise quality as against the quantity  we should respect our parliamentary committee system    
__label__callforaction __label__for   before  the  government  went  to  the rajya  sabha  our  suggestion  was  incorporated  as  an  amendment  went  to  the amendments  and  subsequently  a  select  committee  was  formed    the  select committee suggested certain suggestions and those suggestions unanimously have been accepted in passing  i would only say when we are dealing with scheduled areas which are demarcated by the constitution schedule v and schedule vi it is a sensitive area and a sensitive issue  in that respect let us not rush through certain bills  and  certain  amendments  in  such  a  manner  because  of  the  majoritarian outlook  i would think this government that in their wisdom they have corrected the  mistake  that  was  being  committed  and  all  mineral  bearing  states  by  these amendments  are  going  to  be  benefited  tremendously  especially  those  people  who reside in schedule v and schedule vi areas i would only ask that in this district mineral foundation and how they are going to function how that money is going to pass on for the area development of those mineral where the mining is going to take  place   that  needs  to  be  monitored   i  think  the  government of  india  would take the state government into confidence and ensure the welfare of the displaced persons and the mine workers  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   when  this  bill  was sent  to  the  rajya  sabha  after  having  been  passed  from  this  lok  sabha  rajya sabha considered it for a very long time and subsequently rajya sabha decided to refer it to the select committee  the select committee took a very little time and discussed  it  comprehensively  and  submitted  its  report  within  7  days  to  the  rajya sabha    i  am  happy  to  note  that  the  select  committee  has  also  suggested  certain amendments after considering the bill  the government has also agreed to those amendments  because  all  of  them  are  good  provisions  and  the  government  was neither reluctant to accept them in the past nor is a government hesitant to accept them  today    today  one  of  the  hon  member  has  suggested  an  amendment    i would like to urge the hon member that only the addition of the word exclusive is  not  going  to  make  a  significance  difference  to  the  bill    the  original  intent  of that word is fully contained in the provisions of the bill  law has its own place but the  willpower  of  the  government  in  implementing  the  law  placed  even  a  greater role    this  government  wants  to  empower  the  state  governments  further  and  it wants that the latter should function with rising accountability  if we have created a  district  mineral  foundation  for  spending  the  money  for  the  welfare  of  the persons displaced due to mining and for the mining area as a whole then we have to show our faith in the state governments  the guidelines required to be given to the state governments have found place in the provisions of the bill and the state governments will be further requested if the need arises  therefore i would like to say  that  the hon member  that the  original  intent of  his  amendment  is very  much contained  in  the  provisions  of  the  bill    therefore  he  should  withdraw  his amendment  i would request the house that this amendment bill which has arrived in modified form after having been amended by the rajya sabha is certainly going to  bring  radical  changes  in  the  field  of  mining  encourage  the  sector  create employment opportunity in the country increase the investment put an end to the corruption    in  the  allocation  of  mining  and  increase  the  transparency    i  would request the house that these amendments find the consent of all the members   the motion was adopted and the amendments were agreed to  
__label__callforaction __label__for   this  bill  was  discussed  at  length  in  lok sabha  and  it  was  passed  with  certain  amendments    but  in  rajya  sabha  some amendments were suggested and accordingly the government has accepted them  i on my own behalf and on behalf of my party support this bill with all those new amendments

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  the central government has taken a comprehensive  review  of  laws  and  the  legal  system  with  a  view  to  removing  the incoherent and redundant laws  it is a good effort to unburden our statue books  i would like to bring to the notice of the government that this year this is the fourth time that such a repealing and an amending bill has come to parliament  do we have a proper historical documentation of these laws  the way we are going about it seems like to unburden our statute books to make them slimmer we are getting rid  of  part  of  our  history    the  law  commission  has  given  suggestion  that  1741 laws  needs  to  be  changed  why  are  we  dealing  in  piecemeal  is  a  suspicion  that would  strike  i  suggest  that  a  committee  comprising  of  lawyers  and  historians should look at these repealed laws or the laws to be repealed and ensure that this does not become a habit  but let us keep a record of the laws that we are repealing  the old and draconian laws have harmed many people in this country  there are certain acts which needs to be relooked at  i would suggest that there should be a debate on the uniform civil code the moment you start differentiating dividing society you fall prey to the evil organisations like the isis  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   all  of  us  understand  that  the  archaic  laws are  to  be  scrapped  as  they  are  creating  hindrance  in  judicial  and  administrative proceedings  there have been so many laws in the statue book which were framed nearly 150 years ago to meet the requirements of those days but in course of time they lost their relevance and their presence and are creating a lot of administrative problems    a  large  pendency  of  cases  was  attributed  directly  to  the  archaic  laws  all  of  us  will  be  happy  if  the  obsolete  laws  which  create  administrative  and judicial hindrance are weeded out  it should be a continuous process  our statue is full of obsolete laws some dating back to the 19th century and early 20th century  we know that since 18346612 central statues have been enacted and some point or the other 3821 have been repealed  the repealing and amending fourth bill proposes  to  repeal  295  obsolete  and  redundant  laws  lying  unnecessarily  on  the statute  book    the  departmentrelated  parliamentary  standing  committee  on personnel public grievances law  and justice has suggested the  sunset  clause   i make an appeal that the government should take efforts to make the laws simple  i fully endorse the views of the standing committee of parliament in this regard   
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  i congratulate the hon law minister who took the initiate to enact this repealing act  in this year we have already passed three repealing acts repealing about 883 acts  now through this bill we are going to repeal 295 acts  now as these laws are obsolete redundant and are not necessary in the given circumstances the government had taken the initiative and all of us should support this bill  on behalf of my party we are supporting it    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   i  stand  here  to  welcome  and  support  the repealing  and  amending  fourth  bill  2015    law  is  to  ensure  easy  access  to justice  to  all    there  have  been  a  plethora  of  laws  on  the  same  subject  in  india  sometimes they are very much contradictory laws  we have to keep the laws to the  minimum  extent  of  what  is  required  for  the  country  as  not  all  laws  can  be implemented  many of the laws are of british era  so many laws are there which are not relevant today and have become obsolete  that is why the police and the other machinery are suffering  in fact ultimately the public is suffering  because of the plethora of laws millions of cases are pending in our courts  there is a need to integrate the similar laws to eliminate the laws which are useless and to make a concerted  effort  for  the  judicial  reforms  in  this  country    in  1998  when  the  nda was in government under the leadership of shri atal bihar vajpayee a panel was constituted    it  recommended  that  1832  laws  had  to  be  repealed  in  this  country  more than 400 laws were repealed  on the basis of the law commissions report and the pc jain commission report they recommended that 1741 laws are to be repealed    today 295 acts are to be repealed  i would also request the hon law minister  that  there  should  be  an  automatic  repeal  clause    section  6a  of  the general clauses act should also be amended  there should be a time bound action to  repeal  obsolete  redundant  and  unnecessary  laws    to  ensure  that  we  have maximum governance we require less and less laws    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  all the hon members have supported the bill with certain observations  we are also trying to see that all the obsolete laws should be repealed as early as possible  for repealing an act the administrative  ministry  has  to  be  consulted   similarly on  certain subjects  which are in the concurrent list we have to write to the state governments to get their opinion    i  can  assure  the  hon  members  that  certainly  all  the  1863  acts  which have been identified as obsolete and redundant we would take care of such laws as soon  as  we  get  the  concurrence  from  the  state  government  and  ministries concerned    we  are  already  working  on  automatic  repeal  clause    this  year onwards  there  will  be  a  sunset  clause  in  all  the  appropriation  bills    automatic repeal clause is the need of the hour  but we need to study further as to how it can be  done  because  it  should  not  have  any  impact  in  subsequent  days    dead  laws create confusion with the living laws this is the observation made by the supreme court  this is the fourth repealing and amending bill that i have placed before this  house  in  short  span  of  six  months    i  will  see  that  all  1863  obsolete  laws would be repealed the bill as amended was passed  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  some  members  were  saying  that  the  actual  expenditure  has  come  down  is  not correct  from 2010 to 2014 the average expenditure per year was rs 94599 crore but these two years rs 223565 crore is  the average expenditure  i am not happy with this expenditure  i am not satisfied also because we need money  housing for all by 2022 is not an easy thing  it requires a huge amount  i am also thankful to some  of  the  members  that  they  made  a  request  to  the  finance  minister  also    i myself  am  pursuing  the  finance  minister  to  make  more  allocation  for  the  housing sector  but the fact of the matter is that the state has to send the proposal  there is a  committee  where  the  representative  of  the  state  government  is  also  there    the task of the committee is to find out whether these proposals are in order or not  i have  not  made  a  single  change  in  any  of  the  proposals  made  by  any  state    some states for their own reason have not even signed the memorandum of agreement  they have to identify the cities which have to be covered  they have to identify the land  i must put it on record that if some states are lagging behind i myself have spoken to the chief ministers of those states  some of our friends were saying that i am changing frequently the size of the cities and all  now it has been decided that this  will  be  covered  in  all  the  notified  towns  across  the  country    secondly  states have to do their home work  i can only sanction  money   the execution has to be done by the state governments and the related agencies  some of the members also made  this  important  point  saying  that  without  creating  basic  infrastructure  and facilities  people  would  naturally  not  go  and  occupy  those  houses    under  the jnnurm  22  per  cent  of  the  houses  which  are  constructed  are  unoccupied    the reason  is  the  lack  of  infrastructure  and  lack  of  proper  planning    so  having  learnt lessons of the jnnurm we have advised the states to please take care of all these aspects before proposing a scheme  that is one of the reasons for the states taking some  time  also  with  regard to  the proposals bihar has  sent proposals  for 30126 houses    we  have  accepted  those  proposals  as  it  is    chhattisgarh  sent  12670   gujarat  sent  66983  jharkhand  send  16522  we  have  accepted  it  as  it  is    money also is released in proportion  we release the first installment once that is spent the second  installment  also  is  automatically  released    similarly  other  states  have  also sent  proposals  and  we  accepted  all  their  proposals  as  it  is    i  can  share  with  my karnataka  friends  that  karnataka  proposals  came  late    i  have  instructed  my secretary  to  consult  the  state  if necessary have  clarifications  and approve  them  in the  same  meeting    that  was  done    i  can  assure  all  the  members  that  there  is  no question of showing any discrimination  with regard of jnnurm within the short period of this nda government of not even two years the total number of houses we have sanctioned is 703186  this is a record  our ultimate idea is that by the time  of  celebration  of  75  years  of  independence  that  is  by  2022  we  would  like  to provide  housing  for  all    both  the  urban  development  ministry  and  the  rural development  ministry  are  working  together    with  regard  to  slum  dwellers  they will be rehabilitated in the same place in an improved habitat atmosphere  rs one lakh  for  each  slum  house  will  be  given  to  the  states  and  the  states  have  to  put  in some  matching  grant    with  regard  to  registration  of  houses  in  pmay  the  houses that are constructed will be registered in the name of female members  our target is to  construct  18  crore  by  2022  in  a  short  span  of  five  months  we  have  approved construction of 683724 houses  compared to the earlier allocation rs 5400 crore have  been  allocated    i  hope  our  states  would  be  able  to  spend  the  money  and  i would be able to demand more money from the finance minister  housing cannot be  done  by  the  central  government  or  the  state  government  alone  the  private sector also has to get into this in a big way  so i appeal to the private sector also to join  the  housing  programme  in  a  big  way    with  regard  to  the  real  estate regulation  and  development  bill  has  been  notified  on  the  1st  may    my department under the chairmanship of secretary is working about the model rules  once  the  model  rules  are  finalised  within  two  months  they  will  be  sent  to  all  the states    states  have  also  to  finalise  the  rules  and  then  they  have  to  appoint  the regulatory authority  once the regulatory authority comes into operation action can  be  taken  against  these  erring  defaulters    there  is  concern  expressed  by  many members that they are not taken into confidence  we are working out with a system wherein the mps also will have some say with regard to identification and also with regard to monitoring of the scheme  with regard to deendayal antyodaya yojana national urban livelihood mission nulm it is extended from 789 cities to all the towns  across  the  country    street  vendors  act  is  a  very  progressive  piece  of legislation but unfortunately in the act it is said that the rules will be made by the states    so  far  its  performance  is  not  satisfactory    i  only  hope  that  the  states  will take immediate steps  about rs 725 crore of fund sanctioned is currently available with  the  states  in  this  regard  for  the  homeless  and  shelters  also    ease  of construction  single  window  clearance  is  another  important  thing    i  have  taken  an initiative  and  had  a  meeting  with  six  of  my  colleagues  around  six  or  seven  times  we  all  sat  together  to  take  steps  for  a  single  window  approval  mechanism  for housing  project    i  am  very  happy  that  all  the  central  government  agencies  have agreed  to  create  certain  bench  marks  and  also  the  ministry  of  civil  aviation  has come  out  with  their  help    with  colour  coding  maps  so  that  very  municipal coporation would be able to understand what is permitted  with regard to defense 28 airports with civilian enclaves would also be given colourcoded zonal notified  with regard to environmental safeguards for incorporation of bylaws the ministry of environment has issued a notification with predefined objectives of monitorable environmental  safeguards  and  conditions  for  buildings  of  different  sizes    lastly  i would  only  say  that  recently  we  have  issued  instructions  for  delhi  and  had  a workshop also  in delhi the applications for housing plans would online only  as regards mumbai i am having a meeting with the chief minister on 6th of this month where we are going to issue guidelines for mumbai also  once delhi and mumbai show a roadmap for others i hope and urge upon all the members of parliament to impress  upon  their  municipal  bodies  as  also  state  governments  to  see  that permission is given within the stipulated period  the chief  ministers of telangana and andhra pradesh have assured in this regard  they have set up a time limit also  i  hope that  every  state  would  set  up a time  limit  of 30  days  to 60  days  maximum  there  are  a  lot  of  other  issues  but  due  to  paucity  of  time  i  would  not  be  able  to touch them  i am thankful to the hon members for the suggestions which they have given  i have taken note of them  our endeavour is to live up to the expectations of the  people    i  seek  the  cooperation  of  the  states  and  urban  local  bodies  in  this endeavour    the discussion was concluded all the cut motions were put and negatived all the demands for grants were voted in full

to do  something about  it    my  humble  suggestion  is  that  the  government  should  give  the  film industry the status of industry  lastly i want to talk about the performing artists  these performing artists are actually the brand ambassadors of our indian art and culture worldwide  but these treasurers of our culture receive no benefit from the government for their dedication towards spreading art and culture  i would once again  humbly  request  the  government  not  to  levy  taxes  on  the  income  of  these performing  artists  with  the  kind  of  taxes  that  are  levied  on  other  business  and financial  institutions   these  artists  live  a  very  humble  life  and  their  earnings  are not as high as the bollywood artists  so for them art is just a sadhana

__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for     once  this  bill  becomes  an  act  and  is  implemented  has  a significant impact on the taxation methodology on india in our present system there are multiple direct and indirect taxes and multiple assessing officers the nature of economic activity today is changing because a number of these taxes by  their  nature  are  converging  even  though  we  become  a  political  entity  in 1947  india  remained  different  economic  entities  every  state  had  its  own  tax and  different  tax  rates  because  of  which  a  lot  of  economic  resources  are  lost there is no free flow of goods and services in the country the object of gst is to have one tax whereby each assesse has only one interface with one assessing officer it should become a more efficient tax which is not easy to breach so that compliance  is  higher  the  constitution  of  india  clearly  divided  the  power between the centre and the state through the central list the state list and the concurrent  list  if  the  centre  exercises  it  that  power  prevails  in  division  of power there was no grey area the idea of gst actually created the grey area the grey area is that you will have a tax which will be jointly imposed by the centre  and  the  states  it  will  be  one  tax  the  centre  and  the  states  will  all merge their taxes into that one tax the centre and the states have both pooled their power into one tax there is a shared sovereignty between the centre and the  states  we  have  created  indias  first  federal  decision  making  authority  by the method of pooled sovereignty the centre and the states will jointly decide what  the  taxation  rates  are  how  the  laws  are  and  how  they  have  to  be administered today when you have tax on tax the good becomes costlier once all that is  removed the  goods  will  become  slightly  cheaper  the recommendation of the law and the rates will come from the council  it  is  the  gst  council  which  will  decide  the  rate  the  gst  council  got  the power under article 279a to make a recommendation with regard to the model law  there  will  be  parliamentary  control  there  will  be  control  of  state legislatures  on  annual  financial  statements  and  on  the  rates  which  were included  in  the  financial  bill  ordinarily  those  recommendations  are  to  be acted  upon  and  in  case  these  are  not  acted  upon  we  can  refer  it  back  for reconsideration therefore read article 246a and article 279a harmoniously and  therefore  the  authority  of  law  that  article  265  talks  of  is  the  law  framed under article 246a which parliament and state assemblies will approve on the recommendation of the gst council  therefore this is the authority of law in accordance with article 265 the government has adopted compensation cess formula instead of taxation formula for compensating states if the government had followed taxation formula the total tax impact of funding the compensation through a tax would be abnormally high a rs 172000 crore of tax would have to  be  imposed  for  the  central  government  to  get  rs  50000  crore  in  order  to fund  the  compensation  there  will  be  no  extra  burden  on  consumers  in  this formula it will remain transient for the period of 5 years so that this can be used as far as the compensation is concerned you have raised it as to why this is a money bill this bill seeks to replace the central excise law the service tax law  the  vat  law  and  the  various  other  taxation  laws  it  consolidates  them into one according to article 110 of the constitution if a bill seeks to impose a tax  it  shall  always  be  deemed  to  be  a  money  bill  some  member  were uncomfortable about the idea of an antiprofiteering clause an antiprofiteering clause  is  that  nobody  must  have  an  unjust  enrichment  because  of  taxation  if there is a tax rebate then it must be passed on to the consumer that is the antiprofiteering clause which is there in this bill shri moily rightly argued that tax evasion  takes  place  in  real  estate  transactions  also  so  real  estate  should  be brought under the ambit of gst as  i said in the beginning that it is a federal body  and  we  have  to  consult  states  also  in  this  matter  but  the  states  were apprehensive  that  if  the  real  estate  is  included  in  the  gst  the  collection  of stamp  duty  etc  would  be  affected  thereafter  the  chief  economic  advisor prepared a paper in which he said that the states can keep their stamp duty and other revenues that they get out of it these are the advantages the states will get the finance minister of delhi made a detailed presentation to the council making a strong case why real estate should be included after listening to him and these presentations the council decided  let the gst be implemented in the very first year we will take up the issue of real estate whether we have to bring it within the consideration itself or not same is the position with regard to petroleum products and potable alcoholconsumable alcohol states held that huge revenue is involved in these products and they cannot agree with regard to these  products  after  deliberations  we  persuaded  the  states  and  told  them  that alcohol would be spared but petroleum would be included in the gst through constitutional amendment today petroleum has been constitutionally within the  gst  but  its  gst  will  be  zerorated  once  the  experiment  of  gst  moves forward  the  council  will  have  an  opportunity  without  amending  the constitution to decide what is to be done with regard to the petroleum products itself the council had some apprehensions regarding certain issues but so far as the council has worked i have thought it proper that we would take decision on the basis of consensus the review of the revenue service was that as far as the  igst  law  is  concerned  it  has  to  be  entirely  centrally  administered  the reasoning they gave was from the language of the constitution itself as also the fact  that  if  there  is  a  dispute  between  two  states  then  one  or  the  two  states should not become the adjudicator this issue was discussed at length and by a unanimous decision we arrived at an arrangement if you see article 258 of the constitution if the centre has to perform taxation function which is under igst we can perform under the constitution the centre is empowered to delegate it to  one  of  the  state  many  regional  parties  including  the  west  bengal government  were  very  particular  on  the  sharing  of  this  power  with  the  states itself and did not want centre to exclusively have this power the council took an  alternative  view  i  then  had  a  meeting  with  the  current  cag  and  i conveyed  to  him  the  views  that  your  authority  remains  unchallenged  or unchanged  but  the  source  of  your  authority  is  the  constitution  as  also  the provisions of the cag act itself that jurisdiction remains if you have hired contract  labour  but  it  does  not  mean  that  the  products  you  call  agricultural products  will  also  be  taxed  these  products  can  still  be  zero  rated  and  you should consider this with this point of view i think there is no confusion in this because these products are to be kept in category of zero rated products i was referring  to  the  banking  provision  with  regard  to  exemption  from  multiple registrations there is a overriding power under clause 148 which is there the central  government  only  has  a  ministerial  job  of  notifying  the  rates  the central government does not decide the rates madam the council is going to be  as  i  said  a  permanent  body  and  that  permanent  body  is  represented  by almost every state government literally by every state government  all the bills were passed    2017 by lok sabha secretariat note  it  is  the  verbatim  debates  of  the  lok  sabha  and  not  the  synopsis  that 
__label__defect __label__for   we are having discussion on gst from  2005  onwards    we  know  that  it  is  a  paradigm  shift  in  the  interest  tax regime  this is a structural change in the indirect tax system  it is a significant improvement  in  the  indirect  tax  reforms  also    we  hope  that  it  will  definitely benefit  the  national  economy    it  will  also  be  benefitting  in  the  case  of  tax compliance  we are all hopeful that the countrys indirect tax collection will be benefitted    my  apprehension  is  regarding  the  federal  structure  of  the  indian constitution   the  states  have  the  freedom  to  pursue  their  own  fiscal  policies  if the state government wants to raise the rate of tax the state government has to approach the gst  council for getting the rate of tax increased  that means the  fiscal  autonomy  of  the  states  have  been  abrogated  by    means  of  gst legislation    federal  character  is  the  basic  structure  of  the  indian  constitution   clause  9  of  the  central  gst  bill  stipulates  that  the  central  government  shall levy and impose tax at a rate not exceeding 20 per cent and this will be notified by  the  government  on  the  advice  of  the  gst  council    the  legislative supremacy  of  parliament  is  being  taken  away  by  the  gst  council  and  the government will notify the rate of tax    that is against the basic principle of our  constitution    gst  council  is  getting  arbitrary  discretionary  authority  to impose  cess  on  any  item   i  hope that it will benefit the nation  as a  whole but unfortunately the central government is benefitted more than the states    
__label__callforaction __label__for   taxes  are  charged  in  our  country  though too  many  forms  of  taxes  in  such  a  situation  our  country  has  decided  to implement  one  tax  for  all  by  converting  all  the  taxes  into  this  system  in connection with compound taxes those having a turnover of more than 20 lakh rupees  have  to  register  mandatorily  i  think  this  amount  is  less  it  should  be increased up to 30 lakh rupees turnover the manufacturing companies having 50  lakh  rupees  turnover  will  have  to  give  one  percent  composite  tax  and restaurants having turnover above 50 lakh will have to pay two and half percent composite tax i would like to request the honble finance minister to make it at least 75 lakh rupees   
__label__appreciation __label__for  this  legislation will not only merge all  other  17  types  of  taxes  into  one  but  it  will  also  create  huge  employment generation in the country it  will  also help small traders farmers agriculturists big  industries  and  even  middlemen  india  will  become  the  fastestgrowing economy in the world and we may even surpass the other developed countries there will also be rise in gdp to the extent of 72 per cent since it is onebillonenationonetax we will be happy that there will be enhancement in taxation as we will be earning more money  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  by amalgamating many central and state taxes into a single tax the gst would mitigate double taxation and would eventually pave  the  way  for  a  common  national  market  when  implemented  the  cgst sgstutgst  and  igst  would  be  levied  at  rates  to  be  mutually  agreed  upon by the centre and the states in the gst council i would like to suggest that the details of all these taxes may be made more simpler similarly the payment to government  and  subsequent  refunds  be  minimised  or  kept  at  a  minimum possible level the division of administrative control over taxpayers need to be reconsidered  regarding  the  power  to  collect  gst  in  the  territorial  waters  and its further delegation to the states i feel the act should specifically mention this and it should be made a part of the act itself as for the organizational structure and deployment of human resources i feel the ministry of finance should place report of the working group on the table of parliament   
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   there  are  as  many  as four  bills  before  us  today    in  fact  this  was  an  important  game  changer enactment and this bill was introduced promptly by the then upa government  it is more than seven to eight years passed now  who is the loser in delaying it  it  is  the  people  of  this  country  and  we  lost  about  a  total  of  rs  12  lakh  crore  with  regard  to  these  bills  i  would  like  to  submit  that  preparation  for implementation  has  not  been  done  to  the  satisfaction  of  authorities  concerned whether  of  the  states  or  the  centre    besides  small  businessmen  and  traders particularly must be made to understand the nuances of the new law  there are ten  working  groups  constituted  to  look  into  specific  issues  of  sectors  like banking  finance  insurance  telecom  etc    but  there  are  several  other  very important and crucial sectors where the groups have not been formed and i do not even find any committee or group formed to look into that problem  there is  no  clarity  with  regard  to  excise  free  zones  like  the  northeast  and  other backward  states  and  special  economic  zones    this  will  discriminate  against the  development  of  these  regions    similarly  there  is  no  clarity  on  how  antiprofiteering provision would be implemented  i would like to ask that how can you invoke it in a market economy  ultimately there are a number of people who can be put inside jails for no reason  the antiprofiteering penal provision in this gst bill is far too vague and draconian  it could discourage companies from  making  efficient  improvements  in  supply  chains  as  they  are  required  to pass  on  the  entire  benefit  to  the  consumer    a  very  important  sector  like  real estate that is supposed to be the area which generates a lot of black money has been ignored by you  the government had not included it  as far as interstate movement  of  goods  is  concerned  there  is  substantial  increase  in  the administrative procedure and documentation  this will increase red tapism this will be a big impediment in business operations  in addition to that entry tax is not clear with respect to the merger of different taxes with  the gst  as far as the tax rates are concerned  there are too many rates  this itself will defeat the objective of the gst  regarding the cesses we do not know the fate of various cesses  surcharges  and  additional  excise  duty  and  we  need  a  clarification  on that    there  should  have  been  some  strict  prohibition  to  ensure  that  no  cess surcharge  or  additional  excise  duty  would  be  imposed  henceforward    again taxation  of  selfsupplies  proposes  all  interstate  movement  of  goods  and services between two divisions of the same legal entity would be subject to tax  in fact any movement of goods and services from one state to another becomes subject  to  tax    the  refund  itself  is  not  automatic    it  should  have  been automatic    a  major  aspect  of  this  bill  is  that  the  gst  council  is  only  an extension  of  the  executive    it  is  only  a  coordinating  body    the  central legislation  will  have  no  power  to  abrogate  the  power  of  the  state    as  per  the present  wording  it  appears  that  only  the  gst  council  and  the  central government  matter  as  a  notification  can  be issued  merely  on the recommendation  of  the  council  by  the  central  government    this  is  a fundamental  contradiction  to  the  basic  legal  framework  and  legal  relationship between  the  union  executive  and  the  union  legislative  as  envisaged  in  the indian constitution  any ambiguity on this issue lead to lot of hassles for the tax payer  taxation has to be simplified  i would like the government to spell out  how  this  basic  provision  of  tax  compliance  and  tax  reporting  will  be simplified from the point of view of the tax payer  i would also like to ask from the government that what was the need to have a new definition of agriculture sector in the gst bill  it will bring agriculturist in the back door into the tax net even as most farm produce are exempted from gst  you have made some calculations for compensations but that is not adequate at all  the gst debate now continues on categorization of products  are parachute hair oil and edible oil one and the same  maybe a lot of corruption and harassment will get in  if you  avoid  all  these  things  from  the  scrutiny  of  parliament  everything  can happen    has  the  government  evaluated  the  prospect  of  igst  leading  to cascading  effect  on  prices  and  its  impact  on  inflation    will  there  be  a  fair mechanism  to  ensure  that  originating  states  do  not  suffer  revenue  losses  as igst  is  a  destination  based  tax  which  favours  the  net  consuming  states  only  the  issue  regarding  distinction  between  the  central  tax  administration  and  the state tax administration has to be explained  i have already told you that there will be turf war  what started out as a single tax and a single market dream for industry  has  now  degenerated  into  five  rates  and  a  cess on  top  with  additional uncertainty about tax rates  administration both at the state and centre will be technological nightmare  with regard to many appellate bodies i would like to submit a fundamental mistake has been committed and it will be struck down by the judiciary  liability linkages provisions are extremely bad  there is no provision  with  regard  to  inflation    gsts  have  been  withdrawn  in  many  other countries because of profiteering and also because of inflationary measure  the intention is very  good   but ultimately  the  government is landing  this  country into an area of tax distortions and there could be anarchy and war between the states and the central administration  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  these are four important bills and are being taken up together for consideration as their subject matters and references are same  the system of indirect taxes extant anterior to 101st amendment  to  the  constitution  continues  to  exist  even  today  and  is  likely  to continue till 15th september this year  under this system the right to levy some of the taxes was the jurisdiction of the centre and the right to levy some of other taxes  was  under  the  jurisdiction  of  states    but  these  bills  seek  to  ensure  the movement of all the goods and services all over india to set up uniform system of  taxation  facilitate  the  interface  of  an  assessee  with  only  one  assessee authority  the tax proceeds so collected will be shared by both the centre and the  states    this  system  is  somewhat  different  from  the  earlier  one    it  is different because we are now creating by law a jurisdiction simultaneously both in  the  centre  and  the  states  and  in  the  process  handing  over  the  indirect  tax administration  to  the  first  federal  institution  that  india  has  created  where  the centre  and  the  states  both  will  participate    in  this  respect  the  goods  and services  tax  council  made  unanimous  recommendations  for  five  laws  out  of which  four  laws  will  come  up  before  the  parliament  and  one  before  the legislative  assemblies  of  all  the  states  and  two  union  territories  where legislative  assembly  exists    first  law  is  the  central  gst  law  which  includes the  integration  of  taxes  to  be  incurred  on  goods  and  services  determine  the ceiling  of  taxation  and  collection  of  taxes  etc    second  law  is  the  sgst  law which will not come up before the centre but before 31 legislative assemblies  this  law  will  be  a  mirror  image  of  the  central  law  and  will provide  for  as to how  the  gst  will  be  implemented  in  every  state   third  law  is  the  integrated gst  which  will  handle  the  taxes  likely  to  be  incurred  on  the  transactions  of interstate trades from one state to another state and from one union territory to the other union territory  fourth is the union territory gst law which in a way stands to be the cgst law as it incorporates its provisions and implement them  in  the  union  territories    fifth  and  the  last  one  deals  with  the  system under  which  provisions  have  been  made  to  provide  compensation  to  the  state which suffers loss as a result of its implementation  a provision has been made for  compensation  cess  in  order  to  provide  for  compensation  to  such  states which includes tax exceeding 28 per cent on the luxury items   apart from this the  gst  council  is  indias  first  federal  institution  where  sovereignty  of  the centre and the states in relation to indirect taxes has been pooled together in a federal  institution    hence  to  create  indias  first  federal  institution  it  is incumbent  on  all  of  us  to  make  sure  that  the  federal  institution  works  therefore  i  hope  we  are  guided  to  maintain  that  delicate  balance  of  that relationship  itself    with  these  few  words  i  commend  these  laws  for  the consideration of the house  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   the  union  government  has  tabled four  gst  legislations  in  the  lok  sabha    10  groups  have  been  set  up  under senior tax  officials  to  examine the  concerns  of  the industry  and submit  reports by april 10th  most issues have been addressed through feedback but it was felt that some sectors having special peculiarities needed a closer look to ensure that they were able to make a glitch free shift to the gst   they have been asked to focus  in  particular  on  procedural  simplifications  and  the  rate  structure    gst will  be  the  biggest  reform  in  indian  taxation  since  1947    but  there  are  many challenges  for  its  successful  implantation    these  include  getting  acceptance from all the stakeholders the states concerned the union territories and most importantly  from  the  traders  and  small  industries  sectors    through  revenue neutral  rate  the  government  is  to  ensure  that  its  revenue  remains  the  same despite of giving tax credits  the government has already incorporated goods and services tax network gstn  we acknowledge that fundamental purpose of  gst  is  to  make  india  as  one  state  where  interstate  movement  of  goods  is common    tamil  nadu  is  concerned  about  the  impact  the  proposed  gst  will have on the fiscal autonomy of states and the huge permanent revenue loss it is likely to cause to the  manufacturing and exporting state like tamil nadu  we are  happy  that  some  of  the  concerns  raised  by  us  have  been  addressed    but however  a  number  of  concerns  of  tamil  nadu  still  need  to  be  addressed including  the  gst  council  as  a  constitutional  body  infringes  the  legislative sovereignty  of  both  the  parliament  and  the  state  legislatures  and  completely jeopardizes  the  autonomy  of  the  states  in  fiscal  matters  furthermore  the decision making role and voting weightage in the council are unacceptable the cost  of  agricultural  inputs  will  go  up  since  the  agricultural  implements fertilizers  seeds  will  also  be  taxed  at  gst  rate  of  25  per  cent    there  is  an apprehension that the implementation  of  gst  will  make the  present commercial tax department redundant  i am glad to note that the deliberations in the gst council have been open and many of the concerns raised by us have been  accommodated  in  the  spirit  of  give  and  take  we  have  successfully migrated 519 lakh dealers out of a total of 601 lakh dealers that is 86 per cent till date  we are fully geared up as far as it hardware is concerned  software customization  is  also  progressing  well    i  would  like  to  conclude  by  assuring that  tamil  nadu is  fully  committed to the  roll  out  and  successful implementation of the gst

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against  people are saying that gst will be a  game  changer  and  will  bring  immense  benefit  to  manufacturers  traders exporters  and  others  but  we  the  biju  janata  dal  on  this  side  believe  that  it would be illusory to expect too much from it   the basic advantage comes from an  amalgamation  of  nearly  oneandahalf  dozen  central  and  state  taxes    but yet  again  i  will  like  to  remind  this  house  not  to  expect  too  much  from  gst because it all depends on the revenue neutral rate that is fixed  it is now fixed at zero per cent five per cent 12 per cent 18 per cent and 28 per cent and above  it  will  be  known  only  after  the  first  year  whether  it  is  revenue  neutral  or  not  the  claim  that  the  consumer  will  benefit  due  to  less  tax  burden  is  also  very illusory  will the prices come down after implementation of this law  that is the  basic  thing  which  our  people  wanted  to  know   distinction  between  goods and  services  will  not  go  since  a  separate  rate  for  service  tax  is  also  being introduced    under  clause  1712  the  central  government  may  constitute  an authority  or  empower  existing  authority  constituted  under  any  law  as  an  antiprofiteering  measure    but  we  have  a  competition  law  and  why  should  the government  have  a  provision  in  this  bill  which  empowers  the  government  to constitute  an  antiprofiteering  authority    this  is  a  very  retrograde  step  the competition  act  of  2002  provides  for  action  against  abuse  of  dominant position   no  other  antiprofiteering  law  is  necessary   on  the  gst compensation  bill  i  have  moved  two  amendments  these  are  our  states concerns  on our persistent raising the issue of compensation this government has  come  up  with  this  bill    still  there  is  a  little  bit  of  concern    in  council odishas  case  was  not  considered  in  full  detail    odisha  brought  to  the  gst council  the  issue  relating  to  entry  tax  which  will  impact  the  amount  of compensation    dealers  in  odisha  had  challenged  the  validity  of  odisha  entry tax act 1999 in hon supreme court and dealers have been paying only 50 per cent of entry tax  as a result we have been restrained to collect the full amount  therefore it was proposed by odisha that such revenue on account of the year 201516 should  either  be  included  in  the base  year  of  201516  calculated  or  it should  be  excluded  from  calculating  the  actual  revenue  for  the  concerned subsequent  year  or  years    otherwise  the  amount  of  compensation  will  be unfairly reduced  however this proposal was not accepted in the gst council  hence justice was not done  in the near future we are expected to receive the balance  entry  tax    is  the  government  going  to  calculate  that    therefore  i would appeal  to the finance  minister to  take up this  case on our  behalf in  the council  we had also moved an amendment relating to the clean environment cess  odisha had also raised this in the council  odisha is a coalbearing state and  a  cess  is  being  collected    while  the  rates  of  royalty  have  remained unrevised the union government has enhanced the levy of clean environment cess  to  rs  400  per  tonne  in  the  union  budget  in  201617    it  has  been suggested  by  our  state  that  this  cess  should  be  renamed  as  environment  and rehabilitation cess and at least 60 per cent of such funds should be shared with the  coalbearing  states    the  remaining  40  per  cent  of  the  cess  may  go  to  the gst  compensation  fund    however  the  gst  council  has  decided  that  the entire  proceeds  of  clean  environment  cess  would  be  used  for  gst compensation    that  is  our  concern    as  far  as  the  issue  of  parliamentary oversight is concerned such oversight collapses once the power under igst is delegated to the states  this grant of power is without any accountability this is  constitutionally  not  permissible    there  would  be  multiple  registrations  for service  providers  and  that  goes  against  the  idea  of  one  nation  one  tax    this does not seem to be in the spirit of ease of doing business  west bengal has a tenancy act  now the owner of the land will come under gst  there is a case where in a roundabout way  you are bringing agriculturist into tax net  shared cropping  is  now  going  to  be  taxed  under  this  bill    punjab  had  vehemently objected to bringing agriculturist within this bill and imposing tax on him but this  objection  was not  accepted   haryana also objected  to it    items  like dairy farming  and  poultry  have  not  been  included  in  the  definition  of  agriculture  what about the land laws of west bengal odisha jharkhand punjab haryana and what about their farmers  i am not going to challenge the decision or the wisdom of the council  but it will be challenged at some point of time unless a consensus  builds  up    it  is  because  a  large  section  of  society  is  going  to  get affected when you are defining the agriculturists and bringing them under gst

__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   the  gst  bill  will undoubtedly have lots of benefits like concrete tax structure broadening of tax base simplifying tax procedures avoiding duplication and cascading effects and creating a single common market  i just want to ask the government if there are any future plans to bring the alcohol and petroleum products within the gambit of  gst    at  present  the  central  government  has  agreed  to  compensate  the states for five years  i think that the government would also continue it even after five years if the loss continues  one challenge that is still there before the government is of categorization of commodities as well as of companies  the government  should  have  brought  this  bill  after  resorting  to  these  important issues    it  is  good  to  charge  alcoholic  beverages    the  government  should reconsider  putting  additional  cess  on  aerated  drinks  particularly  nonalcoholic beverages  because  the  common  man  are  also  taking  them  in  big  quantities  when it comes to the offshore jurisdiction earlier it was vested with the central government    now  they  are  giving  the  power  upto  12  nautical  miles  to  the states  if the sea is shared by two states every time there will be a big problem for  the  fishermen  of  both  the  states  which  needs  to  be  resolved    the government  is  putting  additional  cess  whenever  there  is  a  loss  of  revenue  by the  states  on  consumer  durables  which  also  include  a  small  refrigerator  airconditioner and all that  so i think this issue should be relooked at presently the tax base is shared by the government of india and state governments in the ratio of 5050 but now with the advent of gst the entire base is likely to go to the  government  of  india  in  the  long  run  the  concept  of  federalism  may disappear as far as financial matters are concerned  so at least the companies which have the gst turnover of less than rs15  crore should be given to the state government  besides stiff rules are required for tax defaulters

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   at the outset let me just say that i and my party support  the  bill    however  the  reason  i  am  speaking  on  this  particular  bill  is  to actually  give  a  sense  of  what  sikkim  was  before  1975    it  was  in  1975  that  a historical referendum was undertaken in sikkim through the government of india because  sikkim  was  a  protectorate  of  india    however  through  the  36th constitution amendment sikkim became the 22nd state of india  there has been reservation  in  sikkim  assembly  and  there  have  been  further  reservations  as scheduled tribes as well  but the scheduled tribes who were reserved earlier is not under article 332 of the constitution of india  it is only two communities  the limbu community and the tamang community  which got the reservation in 2003 through a constitution amendment  today the state government is pressed with the  idea  that  we  would  have  to  give  the  same  kind  of  reservation  to  11  other communities    dewan  gurung  mangar khambu  rai  sunuwar  bahun  chhetri sanyasi  jogi  and  two  others    thereby  making  the  entire  sikkim  subjects  all sikkim  subjects  as  tribals  in  the  state  of  sikkim    this  is  the  demand  which  we have forwarded to the central government and we would like to see the light of the day in this particular demand   
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   the  chhattisgarh  state  government decreased  the  reservation  for  scheduled  caste  from  16  to  12  per  cent  on  7th december  2011  and  they  have  attributed  two  reasons  for  the  same    the  first reason is that chhattisgarh state came into existence after the state reorganisation act 2000  the population of scheduled caste came down to 116 per cent as per the 2001 census as compared to 1517 per cent as per the 1991 census  there is a provision of 12 per cent reservation for scheduled caste in direct recruitment to the chhattisgarh  state  services  at  present    the  new  revised  reservation  came  into existence in 2011 which also happens to be census year  as per the 2011 census the population of scheduled caste has gone up to 855587 in the state  similarly their population which constituted 116 per cent in 2001 has now gone up to 1282 per  cent    therefore  there  is  a  need  for  corresponding  increase  in  reservation  most of the people belonging to scheduled caste migrate elsewhere due to their bad economic condition  as such these people do not get counted in the census of the state  moreover most of the people belonging to this community get their religion recorded  as  christian  or  satnam    a  reduction  of  4  per  cent  in  reservation  has adversely affected their welfare measures as also constitutional rights  i therefore request  the  chhattisgarh  government  to  restore  the  earlier  reservation  of  16  per cent for them by withdrawing the reduction of 4 per cent    
__label__callforaction __label__for  i rise to support this bill  in my parliamentary constituency  bhadohi  in  uttar  pradesh  people  of  bind  nishad  dhimar communities have their relatives in delhi and madhya pradesh who are included in the scheduled caste list  similarly they also want that they should also be included in the scheduled caste list and it is their right also  at last i would like to say that i have  faith in our  army  and  rashtrya  swayam  sewak  sangh that  they  are  able  to face  any  sort  of  challenge    rashtrya  swayam  sewak  sangh  have  been  working towards the betterment of every section ie farmers labourers students deprived classes women of our society    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  this bill is important because it is aimed at regulating a sector which has a maximum growth potential and which is the second largest employment giver in the country and which contributes about 9 per cent to our gdp  this bill will ensure that the trust the goodwill which was missing in this sector will be brought in again  i would request the hon minister to give some relief to the existing projects  i would also request him to reduce the approval  time  for  developers  required  in  different  phases  of  project    i  think maximum developers should be included in the ambit of this bill    
__label__appreciation __label__for   i  am  thankful  to  all members who have spoken on this important bill  one hon member made out a point that parliament has no jurisdiction to pass this bill  the bill is meant only for  contract and transfer of title   the land  and other  related  issues  are  left  to  the local bodies  the law department as well as the attorney general has opined that the parliament has jurisdiction because it is a concurrent subject  so keeping that in mind only we brought this bill  but the main question is about the genuineness the promptness and the timeliness of the house delivery  this is the major concern of  the  people    the  earlier  government  has  brought  a  bill  in  2013    but  in  2011 itself the debate was started and from 2011 to 2016 for five full years the country was debating this issue  the media was also debating this issue  it will be historic moment in the history of the country because we are fulfilling the aspirations of the people by giving them the needed protection and also by giving credibility to the realty  sector   certain  people have  expressed  certain  concerns  for  example what will  happen  to  the  state  bill    the  central  legislation  overrides  the  state legislation   that is the constitutional position  a point made was why we should confine it to 500 square metres and eight apartments and why we should not reduce it  down    i  have  left  it  to  the  discretion  of  the  states  depending  on  the  local situation  i have given the option to the states to make legislation  i may politely remind  the  hon  members  initially  when  the  bill  came  in  2011  it  was  4000 square metres and the number of apartments was not notified  from 4000 square metres we have brought it down to 500 square metres  but it is not so the rate of interest  payable  by  consumer  and  payable  by  builder  varies    as  per  clause  2a the  rate  of  interest  payable  by  either  party  will  be  the  same    so  there  is  no discrimination  whatsoever    there  is  no  question  of  any  delay  on  our  side  moreover we have tried to hasten the process after wider consultation  we are not against  the  builders    we  want  builders  also  to  be  partners  to  build  strong  and stable india  i am willing to discuss with the builders if they have any problem  the rule says that if a member has any interest he or she should declare it before he  speaks  in  the  house    but  i  do  not  want  to  invoke  the  rule    a  concern  was expressed  by  the  hon  member  from  maharashtra  visvis  their  legislation  and also  on  other  issues    i  am  assuring  them  that  we  will  consider  them  during  the making of the rules  with regard to impact of this on property prices  i would say that  we  would  get  more  investment  we  would  get  early  clearances  and  the property  prices  would  come  down    the  only  purpose  of  this  bill  is  that  what  a developer is promising through an advertisement he should  fulfill it  through this house  i  seek  the  cooperation  of  all  states  because  this  law  will  be  really meaningful if the states come forward and then make those regulations and put the responsibility on the officers concerned  i am not trying to shift the responsibility from the central government to the state governments  with regard to the matter raised by a member that states should be given powers to appoint more authorities i  would  say  that  there  should  not  be  dual  authorities  at  the  same  time  certain powers are delegated to the states  it is provided in clause 20  then there is the point  of  structural  defects    now  the  responsibility  of  rectification  of  structural defects  lies  with  the  builder  promoter  and  developer  for  a  period  of  five  years  article  2  k  provides  for  an  exhaustive  definition  for  carpet  area    clause  42 provides that the promoter shall disclose at the time of  making an application for registration of the project with the regulatory authority regarding the number type and the carpet area of the apartments for sale in the project  for existing projects a window of three months from the date of notification has been given under clause 3  for  making  an  application  to  the  authority  and  to  disclose  the  same    future disclosure of  carpet area  would  not  affect  the past sales  under the  existing or ongoing projects  with regard to government bodies it has been brought within the purview of the act  the government bodies are collecting money and they are not constructing  houses  in  time    moreover  this  bill  will  reinforce  the  trust  and promote sales  the day this act is notified there will be a boom in the real estate sector and people will purchase houses with more confidence  private people will come and invest more with regard to government formulating a national urban rental housing policy the government is in the process of developing this policy and  a  model  tenancy  law  which  will  encourage  house  owners  to  let  out  vacant houses on rent so the government has shown its commitment its caliber  so i am  happy  that  our  friends  from  the  other  side  from  all  sides  are  supporting  us  the  bill  cuts  across  all  sections  particularly  the  middle  income  group  consumers have  been  facing  problems  and  harassment    phasewise  registration  is  also provided  in  the  bill   a  project  could  be declared  and  executed  in  phases  but  for every  phase  these  provisions  will  apply  70  per  cent  amount  is  the  criteria applicable for each phase separately  the bill provides for five years liability for structural  defects not  for other defects  the  bill  will  apply  uniformly  across the country    the  need  is  to  ensure  timely  completion  of  projects    the  definition  of allottee  is  very  exhaustive  and  i  have  already  explained  it    discrimination  is another issue  the constitution is already taking care of it that is why i have not made  any  separate  mention  about  this    under  this  bill  promoters  cannot  sell without registration of the project to the authority  i appeal to all the home buyers across  the  country  not  to  give  any  advance  before  registration  of  the  project    again central bill will override the state bill  that is the constitutional position  i  would  like  to  say  that this  bill  will cover  both  residential  and  commercial  also  moreover  standards  are  provided  in  32  for  promotional  measures    central advisory  council  is  being  proposed  for  advising  and  improvement  also  practically to the extent possible i have tried to cover all the suggestions given by the  hon  members    i  am  sure  that  this  bill  will  live  up  to  the  expectations  and aspirations of the people   the bill was passed 
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   this  historic  bill  like  many other  important  bills  was  originally  brought  by  the  upa  government    at  that time like those  bills  and  aadhar this  bill  was  also  opposed  by  the  members now in treasury benches  some crucial provisions of the original bill have been omitted by the nda government  that is why there is a demand from the rajya sabha for referring it to the select committee  to build a home is the dream of the people especially the poor people  we know that there are a lot of faulty practices and  cheating  in  real  estate  sector  so  i  welcome  this  bill    the  bill  says  that  all states and union territories must establish state level regulatory authorities  the bill also proposes to constitute real estate appellate tribunal  the tribunal may also  refer  the  case to  the  competition  commission   a  central  advisory  council consisting  of  representatives  from  the  union  ministry  state  governments representatives of the real estate regulatory authorities consumers and labourers will be established to advise the central government on major questions of policy and protection of consumer interest  one of the important provisions in this bill is that 70 per  cent of the  amount  collected  from  the buyers should be used  only  for construction    then  the  bill  requires  that  all  residential  projects  with  some exception  be  registered    registration  is  not  required  for  projects  which  are  less than  500  sq  meters  or  entail  the  construction  of  less  than  eight  apartments    i would  suggest  that  requirement  of  registration  should  be  avoided  and  the  rajya sabha select committee have also given that suggestion to you  real estate agents must  also  register  themselves    there  are  certain  inconsistencies  in  the  bill  several states have already enacted or are in the process of enacting laws that have provisions  that  are  inconsistent  with  the  bill    according  to  the  provisions  of  the bill  the  penalty  for  the  consumer  is  higher  and  the  penalty  for  the  developer  is less developers have to pay only two or three per cent in case of default but the consumers pay 16 to 18 per cent of interest for their default  this is also against the suggestion made by the select committee  it should be rectified  i appreciate the ministers wisdom that he has provided that 70 per cent of the amount collected from  the  buyer  should  be  deposited  in  a  separate  account    there  is  provision  of even  imprisonment  for  the  realtors  if  they  fail  to  abide  by  the  orders  by  the appellate tribunal  the term allottee should be redefined to include the person agreed to be sold  the bill has already been delayed  now we all expect its early passage   
__label__callforaction __label__for   i  would  like  to  request  the  hon members to pay a special attention to this bill because this bill is the need of the hour    we  have  been  discussing  about  some  regulation  in  the  real  estate  for  the last  11  years  because  all  the  buyersconsumers  across  the  country  are  agitated rightly  and  they  are  not  getting  adequate  redressal  system  as  per  the  previous arrangement  so keeping that in mind during the upa regime a bill was brought and the bill was referred to the standing committee  the standing committee has made  certain  recommendations    out  of  30  and  odd  recommendations  2223 recommendations were accepted  in between there was a change of government and the government that came has brought it in the form of a new bill  the bill which  was  approved  by  the  standing  committee  consisting  of  lok  sabha  and rajya sabha members was again referred to the select committee of rajya sabha and the select committee of the other house has done an excellent job  the bill was debated and decided in the rajya sabha almost unanimously  the purpose of the  bill  is  that  it  is not  only  going  to  make  consumer  the  king  but bring  in  such needed regulation and transparency to the people who are involved in this sector  this bill seeks to create a set of rights and obligations for both the consumers as well as developers  secondly this bill seeks to encourage both of them to live up to the expectations of each other as per the agreement entered into by both of them  if they mutually agreed upon nobody is going to intervene  unfortunately what is happening  is  that  the  buyers  or  the  consumers  are  always  at  the  receiving  end  this  bill  seeks  to  establish  a  regulatory  authority  with  which  the  developer  will register the project to be launched  secondly while doing so they have to declare all  project  related  information  including  the  details  of  developers  status  of  land various approvals project schedule information regarding architects and structural engineers  etc  so  that  there  is  transparency    all  these  things  will  be  in  public domain    thirdly  the  disclosure  helps  the  home  buyers  to  make  an  informed choice    apart  from  promoting  fair  play  in  real  estate  transactions  it  also  aims ensuring timely execution of the projects  timely execution is a major issue  the bill  seeks  to  provide  uniform  regulatory  environment  and  orderly  growth  of  the real  estate  sector    we  feel  that  the  real  estate  developers  are  also  partners  in development    we  in  the  government  do  not  believe  that  private  sector  is  bad  public and private partnership is the need of the hour  the manner in which it was passed  in  the  upper  house  clearly  highlights  that  the  highest  legislature  of  the land  could  do  it  to  further  the  aspirations  of  the  people    i  was  moved  by  the response of the public on social media also after the rajya sabha cleared the bill  our aim of housing for all by 2022 is not possible by mere efforts of the central government or state government alone  government of india state governments and then private sector also should join in a big way  we have so many prestigious projects in the country  that is why even the fdi also is coming in this particular sector    there  is  so  much  concern  among  the  industries  circle  as  to  what  will happen  to  the ongoing  projects on  ongoing  projects  whatever agreement one has entered earlier stands  all of what i am proposing will apply for the future projects along  with  the  projects  which  have  got  stuck  now  regarding  the  provision  of imprisonment  for  any  violation  of  the  orders  of  the  regulatory  authority  some concern is expressed in certain quarters including some sections of the media   if they are not violating any of the orders of the regulatory authority nobody is going to touch them  the consumers courts also will have jurisdiction with regard to the cases wherein some people have a grievance  there cannot be a consumer without a developer and vice versa  and we have to protect the interests of both  nobody should create any hurdles with regard to land acquisition  i would therefore urge upon all the people concerned try to come to some sort of understanding about the land  acquisition  bill  so  that  the  land  is  made  available  for  the  housing  sector  the  government  is  aware  that  40  approvals  are  required  for  housing  project  and the important thing is that they should be given in time  approvals are taking six months  time  one  year  two  years  or  three  years  also    that  is  why  during  the discussion  on  this  bill  i  appeal  through  this  house  to  all  the  state  governments and also urban local bodies to be proactive  we insist on early completion and we must also see that speedy approvals are given  i am dealing with that separately    model  building  bye  laws  are  being  finalised  by  the  ministry  of  urban development  in  consultation  with  the  ministry  of  environment  and  forests    we are at an advanced stage and will be announced for the public so that they need not come  to  delhi  for  environmental  clearance  for  a  project  up  to  a  particular  level  that  responsibility  is  given  to  the  urban  local  bodies  revision  of  national building code is finalised after taking our suggestions  ultimately our target is to ensure  that  all  required  approvals  are  given  in  about  a  months  time    to  ensure housing  for  all  the  government  has  launched  the  prime  ministers  awas  yojana with  an  intention  of  constructing  two  crore  houses  for  urban  poor    keeping  in view  my  request  to  give  housing  an  infrastructure  status  a  number  of announcements  regarding  the  concessions  whether  they  are  service  tax  income tax or fdi have been made by colleague  hon finance minister  i will be further working with him  i would like to see a day wherein the interest rates are further brought down  the only way to bring down the interest rate is that the economy should grow  in this bill we have almost incorporated majority of the suggestions of  the  standing  committee  the  select  committee  and  also  suggestions  given informally by various people  keeping that in mind i would urge upon this august house to please understand and appreciate the intent as also the objectives of this important bill and extend full support    
__label__defect __label__against   land is a state  subject   it would  have been  a  better  idea  had  this  been  sent  as  a  model  bill  to  the  states  with  states enacting  their  own  bill  to  regulate  the  real  estate  sector  this  bill  would  bring several state government agencies under the purview of the act  the bill provides for prior registration of real estate projects with a real estate regulatory authority and  talks  about  the  area  and  number  of  apartments    the  power  to  modify  the threshold  limit  should  vest  with  the  state  government  and  should  not  be appropriated  by  the  central  government    the  amount  realized  for  real  estate project  from  the  allottees  from  time  to  time  shall  be  deposited  in  a  separate account  to  be  maintained  in  a  scheduled  bank  and  shall  be  used  only  for  that purpose    it  should  also  be  made  mandatory  for  the  promoter  to  submit  the accounts  for  the  projects  to  the  real  estate  regulatory  authority  every  quarter  there  should  be  penal  provision  apart  from  the  return  of  the  amount  and compensation if the promoter fails to complete or unable to give the possession of apartment  or  building    this  bill  will  result  in  making  homes  and  flats  more expensive in india  this would drive genuine small time marginal developers out of the realty business and mncs would only thrive

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  it is a much needed bill considering the fact that though the real estate sector is one of the most important sectors of our economy and though it provides direct and indirect employment to cores of people yet it also remains one of the most unorganized sectors the most important step in this  bill  is  that  the  developer  will have  to  put 70 per  cent  of the  money  received from  the  customers  for  a  new  project  in  a  separate  escrow  account  so  that  the funds are not directed to start a new project  this is a huge step to ensure that the construction is completed within the stipulated time  there are many provisions in the bill which give comfort to the buyers against delay and fraud  the bill states that the registration with the regulatory authority is required only for those projects where land is more than 500 square metres or if the number of units is more than eight    i  fail  to  understand  the  rationale  behind  this  ceiling    the  bill  states  that registration is not necessary for redevelopment projects  so is this law applicable to such projects or not  although the bill focuses on developers accountability it should have also brought the civic and other related bodies that are responsible for permission  under  its  ambit    the  bill  has  put  the  onus  of  the  conveyance  deed entirely on the promoter or the developer of the project and the buyers have no say in  the  matter    ideally  there  should  be  a  provision  for  the  deemed  conveyance  to protect  the  interest  of  the  home  buyers  with  respect  to  the  title    i  hope  some  of these concerns will be addressed satisfactorily    
__label__callforaction __label__for  most of the illicit money is having its roots in the real estate  sector    this  definition  of  allottee  in  clause  2c  of  the  bill  may  be improved  why should there be a discrepancy or a difference between 500 square meters  and  above  500  square  meters    if  any  of  the  realtors  are  making  any difference or showing any discrimination on the basis of caste creed religion food habits skin colour race etc  it should be punished because it is an illegal act  i am supporting  this  bill    the  delay  does  not  happen  because  of  any  of  the  acts  or misdeeds on the part of the consumer it is all on the part of the developers  the rights  of  the  people  should  be  preserved    i  think  the  minister  should  add  some more teeth to this bill    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  this bill effectively addresses most of the issues pertaining to the customer addresses some of the issues pertaining to the developer  but  does  not  address  the  issues  pertaining  to  the  competent  authority who  most  of  the  times  is  the  reason  for  delay  and  escalation  in  the  cost  registration  with  the  regulatory  authority  should  be  an  online  process  without  a human interface  for a building permission to be completed there is water supply electricity supply firefighting certificate and other certificates  so the developer is the customer to the competent authority  the competent authorities should also be liable if they delay the project  there is a clause that the developer as a safety measure  has  to  keep  70  per  cent  of  the  project  cost  with  the  local  competent authority  my suggestion is that it should be subject to the local condition  we are now setting up the real estate regulatory authority and appellate tribunal  who is  going  to  bear  the  cost      there  is  rule  of  projects  over  500  square  metres  sometimes  a  clever  and  skilful  developer  may  try  to  circumvent  the  real  estate regulatory authorities  kindly take care of it  i wholeheartedly support the bill   
__label__defect __label__for  i rise to speak in support of this  bill  which  has  been  brought  in  the  interest  of  the  common  men    it  is  well known  that  the  consumer  was  exploited  in  the  real  estate  sector    builders  take advance  on  the  promise  of  constructing  flats    earlier  lands  were  bought  from farmers at a pittance  the project for which lands were acquired were not started and there were talks of starting other projects  the farmers were not paid in full  registrations  were  fake  there  were  no  documents  and  such  types  of  frauds  were committed    this  bill  has  good  provisions  to  put  a  stop  to  such  frauds    it  is  my belief that this bill will strengthen the monitoring system     
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  also  wholeheartedly appreciate  him  for  bringing  out  a  wonderful  legislation    it  really  protects  the consumers  and  brings  in  the  standardization    the  bill  is  silent  if  the  promoter takes advance without registration and needs to be addressed  the conditions of 12 apartments and above 500 square meter should be deleted  it requires balancing of the  promoters  as  well  as  the  interest  of  the  buyers    we  suggest  that  more concessions may be given to affordable housing like the tax holiday less interest etc so that the middle class and the poor will also get benefited  whether housing should  also  be  given  an  infrastructure  status  is  a  longpending  issue    the  bill  is also  silent  on  the  required  defaulters    we  need  to  define  the  carpet  area    one important point is those who are working either in the regulatory authority or in the  appellate  either  as  the  heads  or  as  members  they  should  not  be  allowed  to reemploy  in  the  private  sector    as  regards  50  per  cent  amount  more  than  the deposits  monitoring  of  withdrawals  is  required    lastly  the  black  money  is  the fountain head but it is really silent on that  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  this bill ensures registration and accountability  of  property  promoters  buyers  and  agents    the  bill  provides  to maintain  separate  bank  account  and  the  entire  amount  must  only  be  used  for  the construction  of  that  project    this  bill  provides  to  make  all  transactions transparent  establishment of appellate tribunal is also there in this bill  all these things  are  excellent  as  far  as  this  bill  is  concerned    on  the  one  hand  state legislations  are  there  and  now  the  central  legislations  are  going  to  be  made    i would  like  to  know  as  to  how  the  government  is  going  to  address  the contradiction if any between the state legislation and the central legislation  the escalation  cost  arising  out  of  delays  in  various  stages  such  as  clearance  of  land titles approval from revenue authorities and plan approval from local bodies  etc is  another  problem    there  are  certain  other  problems  like  that  which  may  also kindly be addressed  as far as the regulatory body is concerned i suggest that a representative  of  the  local  body  may  also  be  included  in  that    the  standing committees recommendations are vital  the bill should regulate commercial and industrial real estate as well  the exclusion of projects smaller than 1000 square meter or 12 apartments from the purview of the rera could lead to exclusion of a large  number  of  small  housing  projects    single  window  system  should  be introduced for clearance of various projects with regard to the definition of carpet area the recommendations of the standing committee are so vital    
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__for  i rise to speak in support of this bill    people  of  the  country  wanted  such  a  bill  for  a  long  time    in  the  previous years the real estate builders plundered the people the farmers householders and ditched  everyone    money  was  collected  from  a  large  number  of  people  on  the promise  to  deliver  homes  to  them    there  are  even  such  builders  who  sold  lands meant  for  roads  even  sold  green  parks    a  commission  should  be  set  up  to determine where the money earned through such practices has been deposited  the clause to deposit 70 per cent of the amount in the banks in my view would check black money   lastly i thanked my government for bringing an important bill    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  it is a very perfect bill it is a customer friendly legislation  further transparency and accountability are being brought in  as far as the fraudulent developers and promoters are concerned they can be well controlled in this bill i support this bill  when the construction takes place there is rampant and continued destruction of land trees and plants  a considerable area should be earmarked for green plantation  a very little is being given in the name of  emergency  provision    so  i  would  submit  that  a  considerable  space  may  be allotted  for  emergency  services    my  last  point  is  about  the  preservation  and protection of cultivable lands  it should be taken care of  by the hon minister   
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for     the  bill  seeks  to  protect  the interest of the home buyers  an important problem is regarding providing timely justice to the consumers  at present it takes years for the consumers to get justice  tired  the  consumers  had  to  compromise  with  the  builders    there  should  be transparency  in  the  manner  in  which  speedy  justice  should  be  provided    all categories  of  builders  should  be  covered  in  the  bill  because  at  present  builders construct and sell multistoried buildings on a small plots in metros  if they are not covered  in  this  bill  then  large  number  of  small  consumers  would  be  deprived  of their right  the suggestion of the committee was that in case of any change in the project it would be essential to seek the consent of the consumers  however now it has been provided that only an information needs to be given  this is not in the interest of the consumer    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  i have risen to support the bill  i would like to say few words about the real estate  this is a good legislation which opens up the process  about 32 crore people do not own any house or any land in the country  this bill will certainly create job opportunities  there should be investigation into the black money invested in the real estate  i would also like to know whether any provision  is  being  made  for  scssts  and  obc  in  this  bill  to  enable  them  to  get employment and do business  
__label__callforaction __label__for   in my home state the real estate industry is at an incipient stage  the real estate regulatory authority in each state can be made through the decisions of the state government  constitution grants sikkim a very special status  it is my hope that the autonomy of the state in this matter related to land  and  real  estate  will  be  maintained  to  allow  for  the  inclusion  of  special circumstances in each state especially those in the himalayan region  
__label__callforaction __label__for   i  support  this  legislation    i  wish  to  place  on record the following suggestions  there should be a district level forum which will help  small  and  midlevel  allottees    the  constitution  of  the  appellate  tribunal under  chapter  vii  should  compulsorily  have  one  technical  member    the promoters  should  ensure  that  no  substandard  materials  are  used  as  against  high quality  materials  and  the  promoters  should  be  liable  to  pay  compensation  regarding  noncompletion  if  the  promoters  are  unable  to  give  possession  of  the apartmentflatbuilding  within  the  contractual  period  the  promoter  should  be blacklisted   the  compensation should be  at least 10  per  cent  over  and  above  the housing  loans  of  banks  and  financial  institutions    there  should  be  a  proper garbage disposal and waste management option within the housing complex  floor or roof heights are decreasing day by day  such kind of a low height is not healthy in terms of air circulation and other issues  there should be a minimum height of at least 1213 feet  my humble submission is that the proposed law much strike a balance so that it does not kill the investment in this sector    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  wish  to  congratulate  the  hon  minister  for bringing this piece of legislation to curb the unfair trade practices in the real estate scenario    this  is  the  need  of  the  hour  too    the  objective  of  this  bill  to  is  to regulate  and  develop  the  real  estate  in  our  country    if  we  can  bring  down  this exclusion  area  to  100  square  metres  build  up  area  we  can  bring  more  people because the less privileged and the small buyers can be brought under the ambit of this bill and thereby we can protect their interests also  the net usable area is not defined and much clarity is to be brought in  as regard the period of rectification of the structural defects it should be increased to five years    
__label__for   this bill is very important in the interest of our country  all the members of parliament from andhra pradesh and telangana state have been raising this issue since last three years and i am glad that this bill will be passed today  but after the bill is passed its implementation depends heavily on the    bureaucracy  which  style  of  functioning  has  turned  obsolete  and  due  to  this reason    people  do  not  get  desired  benefits  even  after  the  passing  of  bill  in  the parliament  so i would like to request that certain mechanism should be placed to evolve an accountability system pertaining to the bills passed in the parliament so as to monitor the number and timings of applications received by the bureaucracy along with the time taken in the disposal of those applications   this will benefit the people of our country in a big manner  so it is my request to the government to issue an order through a circular in this regard    dr  ratna  de  nag  i  would  request  the  government  to  set  up  an indian  institute  of  information  technology  design  and  manufacturing  in  my parliamentary constituency which includes singur  declaring existing institutions as  the  institution  of  national  importance  is  welcome  but  it  should  be  done  with  a noble  vision  of  spreading  knowledge  and  information  to  all  parts  of  the  country and  to  be  vested  with  the  best  of  infrastructure  like  labs  paraphernalia  faculty  only then declaring existing universities and institutions as institutions of national importance would serve the purpose    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   the bill declares certain indian institutes of information technology as institutions of national importance  it seeks to develop new  knowledge  in  information  technology  and  provide  manpower  of  global standards  for  the  information  technology  industry    this  is  the  need  of  the  hour considering  the  fact  that  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  bridge  the  gap  between  the government  academia  and  industry    therefore  this  is  a  welcome  move    but  it should bridge the already existing urban and rural divide  it should only augment the  educational  infrastructure  of  the  state  and  should  not  undermine  the  existing institutes  the bill also proposes that the board of governors of each institute will comprise  of  15  members    the  chairperson  is  to  be  nominated  on  the recommendation of the centre  there should be one nominee each of the central government and the state government concerned in the board  i personally feel that there is a need for nomination of one member of parliament from lok sabha and  one  from  rajya  sabha  in  the  board    similarly  the  composition  of  the  coordination forum has to be mentioned clearly  apart from that any dispute arising out of a contract between an institute and any of its employees will be referred to a tribunal  of  arbitration    there  is  a  need  to  create  a  core  forum  to  address  any internal dispute before being referred to the tribunal

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against  i would want this house to carefully ponder over the  question  as  to  what  is  merit    i  pose  this  question  because  i  feel  that  in  our country there is a grave danger of passing of accumulated caste privilege as merit  if there are huge sections of our people who have suffered historic injustice then we should be very careful not to lable them as people who lack merit  iit act wad passed in 1961  but 225 per cent reservation were extended to the iits in 1973  that was done under the prime ministership of shrimati indira gandhi  the obc reservations were not extended until as late as 2006  in iit chennai 464 faculty members  were  in  the  general  category  59  in  the  obc  category  only  11  in  the scheduled caste category in 2015  these numbers cannot be explained by merit alone    we  have  now  given  some  accessibility  to  our  iits  and  to  our  central universities to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes  but the question is have we  given  them  the  feeling  of  equal  citizenship  inside  the  portals  of  our  great institutions  of  higher  learning    we  should  make  sure  that  we  have  the  human resources  to  staff  the  new  institutes    meghnad  saha  had  suggested  that  even nuclear physics research should take place in our finest universities  i would like to  urge  this  government  while  building  on  the  achievements  of  the  past  to  also show a new direction of policy for the future so that the iits which are very good teaching institutions also become the venues for cutting edge research    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  am  really  overwhelmed with  the  support  and  the  quality  of  discussion  we  had  on  these  two  bills    all  are endowed with wisdom but they should be provided opportunity  when opportunity is given their capability comes to the fore  therefore it is duty of the society to provide equal  opportunity    so  those  four  points  have  become  five  points  accessibility quality  affordability  accountability  and  equality    all  these  together  is  what  will make education  today the government incurs rs6 lakh expenditure per student per year  but everyone is not affluent therefore we have to have a graded fee structure  the maximum fee is rs rs2 lakh  it is a complete fee waiver for scheduled tribes and scheduled castes so 23 per cent is covered in that  the people who are earning below  rs1akh  and  physically  handicapped  who  are  talented  they  are  also  having  a complete fee waiver  upto rs5 lakh income they have to pay only rs60000  upto rs9 lakh annual income they will be provided interest free loan and interest free loan means repayment is paid over a period of ten years so they will be given much more than  we  actually  charge    so  major  poor  section  is  completely  covered  through various schemes  we are charging rs2 lakh from the affluent section of the society  those who are capable to pay must pay the fees  again let me put emphasis on the infrastructure    infrastructure  is  not  just  roads  buildings  or  staff  quarters    that  is important    but  more  important  is  research  infrastructure  and  there  is  tremendous backlog    now  all  of  us  together  have  to  do  it    we  have  thought  of  a  higher education financial agency hefa  with budgeted rs1000 crore commitment we  will  apoint  one  partner  in  bank  and  somebody  else  a  financial  institute  to manage it  it will also put in rs1000 crore with that rs2000 crore basic core capital  we  will  leverage  rs20000  crore  for  improving  the  infrastructure throughout  the  iits  and  nits    this  amount  of  rs20000  crore  is  coming  in  the next three years  so on the infrastructure backlog we have already asked all the iits and nits to give us the dprs  so when we sanction the money they should be  ready  with  their  dprs  so  that  the  work  can  start  immediately    many  people talked about that before even coming to the iits the students have to spend lakhs of rupees on coaching  but there also we are coming with a very innovative idea of iitpal  iitpal is a free open course which is available online  i want to make it  available  through  the  tv  also    those  interested  students  need  not  go  to  the coaching  centres  but  can  take  lessons  materials  homework  tutorial  trial examination  and  everything  here everything  what  a  coaching centre  does it  will be  much  better  and  it  is  done  by  the  best  of  the  professors  of  india    that  is  the major initiative which come for all the students  everybody talked about research  we need more new research  we call ourselves as it superpower  but we are not producing  hardware    but  even  in  software  we  have  not  come  out  with  new google    so  there  are  many  things  even  in  software    though  india  youths  have made  significant  contribution  in  innovations  like  google  face  book  and  twitter etc  these  innovations  is  not  in  our  name  the  number  of  total  research publications is 25164   your young scientists have filed 757 patents and of them patents awarded are 137  our capacity is such that we can do ten times more  we are providing at least from rs1 crore to rs5 crore for each research proposal as per requirement  they need our talented youths not go to foreign countries india will  provide  them  the  required  finance    that  is  the  initiative  of  our  hon  prime minister under imprint india  everybody stressed on iitindustry interaction  the uchchatar avishakar yojana was stated in 2015 and we are continuing to improve it further  so there are nearly 500  projects under imprint india and 100 projects under  uchchatar  avishkar  yojana  will  be  taken up which  will  really  start  a new innings for research and innovation in india  under startup we have allowed the iit  hostels  to  start  it  even  in  their  hostel  rooms    so  under  startup  we  are providing  facilities  finance  and  escort  services    we  have  started  an  initiative named  gyan  ie  global  initiative  of  academic  network    more  than  200 professors from all over the world best of the best teachers have come over here conducted the course and have benefited thousands of students  then swayam is a big launch to happen  team comprising five each expert professors of all main courses  and  subjects  for  teaching  students  from  ninth  standard  to  post  graduate level  have  been  constituted    it  will  give  a  new  dimension  to  education  as  good education  for  all  is  the  policy  of  this  government  and  this  government  is marching  ahead  with  this  goal  in  view      therefore  under  national  knowledge network  600  universities  and  institutions  of  national  importance  have  been connected  with  one  gbps  connectivity  provided  there  is  a  platform  for collaborative  learning  and  access  to  high  speed  internet    apart  from  this  all  the central universities in the country are going to be connected through wifi network  under  this  all  the  classrooms  libraries  laboratories  hostels  and  places frequented  by  students  even  canteen  will  be  covered  by  wifi    all  these experiments are increasing the quality of education  one of the hon members has raised  an  important  issue  like  interaction  with  defence  and  space  research organization  this opportunity should be provided to the students  i have noted down  suggestions  of  all  the  hon  members    and  we  will  all  together  take  a decision thereon as providing good education is the duty of all of us  this is also a national agenda too and we will all carry it forward  finally i am thankful to all the hon members for extending their support to this bill the bill as amended was passed

patriotism and we too are trying  to  create  the  same  ambience  for  the  emergence  of  a  sense  of  patriotism  hon  prime  minister  asked  me  to  declare  the  places  of  respect  related  to ambedkarji a place of pilgrimage  acting upon the suggestions of the hon prime minister  we  converted  the  name  of  his  birth  place  mau  in  indore  district  into ambedkar  nagar      at  the  same  time  his  birth  place  was  declared  as  a  place  of pilgrimage    he  was  initiated  in  nagpur  and  at  that  place  of  his  initiation  a committee had constructed a monument  now the government of maharashtra is working out an action plan to expand the land of initiation with about an outlay of rs275    crore    26  alipur  road  a  place  where  ambedkarji  breathed  his  last  was also  declared  to  be  a  national  memorial  and  a  magnificent  monument  has  been decided to be built there  one more magnificent monument has been decided to be built with the expenditure of about rs350 crore at  chaitya bhumi where the last rituals  of  ambedkar  saheb  was  performed    it  has  been  decided  to  set  up  the ambedkar international study center with the cost of rs192 crore at 15 janapath so that people may be able to understand his ideology  most of the people were of the  opinion  that  ambedkarji  was  not  a  patriot  but  i  would  like  to  assert  he  was patriot because he studied in britain and america and in addition to it he had more than 24  degrees  of higher  education   he could have  opted  to get  a  job there  and live a luxurious life with his family but he came back to india with a resolution to sort  out  the  problems  of  inequality  among  people  and  made  efforts  in  this direction  he was of the opinion that the solution to this problem does not lie in the creation of separate things  simultaneously he believes that the temple of god and the natural ponds are meant for everybody and everybody is entitled to avail of the  benefits  of  all  these  things      in  fact  he  has  taken  the  sense  of  vasudev kutumbkam in the right spirit and tried to create an ambience on that ground  as per  as  the  problem  of  dhankar  caste  is  concerned  no  proposal  to  this  effect  has been received from the state government  similarly i would like to  say to those who  have  raised  the  issue  of  inclusion  of  a  caste  into  the  list  that  no  proposals have  been  received  from  their  respective  states  in  this  respect    everybody  wants that the percentage of reservation be raised but we cannot provide reservation more than 50 per cent as there is a ruling of the supreme court in this regard  about the subplan and the rules and regulations related thereto i can say this much that no government  has  ever  released  more  than  15  per  cent  fund    the  budgetary provision for subplan has never exceeded from 9 to 95 per cent during the upa regime    now  this  is  a  matter  of  happiness  that  more  than  rs52  thousand  crore has been given under this plan which shows an increase of 30 per cent as compared to the previous time  our prime minister has started to provide 42 per cent of fund to  the  states  which  was  earlier  32  per  cent  in  order  to  strengthen  the  federal structure  and  to  shore  up  the  economic  condition  of  the  states    moreover  5  per cent more fund has been given to the urban bodies and 2 per cent for pachayati raj system  and  also  2  per  cent  more  as  an  expenditure  to  be  incurred  on  the implementation of these schemes  we provide overseas scholarship to the students going  abroad  for  studies    in  addition  we  provide  fund  under  the  fellowship scheme to the students aspiring to get any special degree or phd  we have started direct  benefit  transfer  scheme  which  plugged  the  leakage    after  all  we  have formulated  a  number  of  schemes  in  order  to  usher  in  overall  development    i  am happy that we have been successful in protecting the interests of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes  we will try to create an atmosphere of equality harmony and  dialogue      the  cooperation  of  all  of  you  is  also  solicited  in  realizing  these objectives    we  are  allocating  fund  for  sc  subplan  according  to  the  rules  and regulations  made  therefore  by  the  previous  government    we  have  given  three times more funds  an hon member has quoted karnataka as an example in this respect i would like to say that there are a number of states like madhya pradesh chhattisgarh himachal pradesh etc  which provide more budgetary allocation for the  welfare  of  these  classes  as  compared  to  that  of  karnataka    the  erstwhile government  declared  aligarh  muslim  university  and  jamiya  miliya  islamiya university  as  minority  educational  institutions  despite  their  being  in  the  list  of central  universities    as  a  result  the  students  from  scheduled  castes  and scheduled tribes community were deprived of the benefit of reservation  i would like to know from the congress party if it will support the initiatives to be taken to restore  the  facility  of  reservation  to  the  students  of  scheduled  castes  and scheduled tribes in both of these universities  the bill was passed  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for     due  care  should  be taken  at  the  time  of  making  the  list  of  scheduled  castes  but  these  days  it  is observed that proposals are sent on the basis of party lines no matter which party is in  government    the  lists  of  the  scheduled  castes  and  the  scheduled  tribes  are always prepared through pressure tactics  a certain caste is in the list of scheduled castes in a state and in the list of scheduled tribes in the other  the same caste may  be  in  the  list  of  backward  classes  in  another  state    this  is  because  socioeconomic  condition  of  that  caste  may  be  different  in  different  states    the communities  which  are  powerful  and  land  owners  financially  and  educationally sound are also in the race of getting into such list  so this issue has to be handled very  carefully    we  generally  talk  on  the  basis  of  figures  but  the  fundamental question  is  as  to  by  when  the  problem  of  these  classes  will  be  solved    dr  baba saheb ambedkar and mahatma gandhi had an agreement known as poona pact  in that poon pact they agreed to give certain percentage of reservation to the dalits the  scheduled  castes  and  the  untouchables    in  this  pact  also  they  agreed  to provide  reservation  in  proportion  to  the  population   the  successive  governments have  been  continuing  with  the  reservation  because  the  condition  of  these  classes has not yet ameliorated  if the reservation is to be discontinued first bring about social reforms end the practice of untouchability and provide level playing field to all      this  problem  will  not  solve  until  there  is  social  equality    baba  saheb ambedkar  had  said  that  political  democracy  has  no  meaning  unless  we  achieve social democracy  in such a situation it is imperative to carry on with reservation  at the same time it is important to make it qualitative

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  my first demand is to increase the percentage of reservation for the people belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in proportion to their  population   it should  be  increased  from  15 to 20 or 22 per cent in proportion to their population through a constitution amendment  of late there is a tendency on the part of everyone to subclassify them and subcategorise them  it is being done maybe for reasons of political benefit or maybe for some other benefit  there are a lot of hostility  towards people belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes  there are no secretaries and joint secretaries in the government of india from the people belonging to scheduled castes community  there are no judges in the judiciary from the scheduled castes community  there are so many judgments coming from the supreme court against reservation  there is  an  urgent  need  to  revisit  and  relook  at  the  entire  reservation  policy  in  the country  we have to seek justice for the people belonging to the scheduled castes and  scheduled  tribes  once  for  all    it  is  because  we  are  striving  for  national integration    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   the  people  belonging  to  scheduled caste got the benefit of reservation by virtue of the poona act and for this they had to struggle a lot  the main intention and spirit of our founding fathers was that if the  reservation  policy  is  implemented  in  letter  and  spirit  then  the  people  of  sc community  would  come  into  the  mainstream  of  the  society  but  this  was  not implemented that way  this is the reason that this community is still neglected and backward  even  after 70  years  of  independence   three universities of the  country were declared as central university at the time of independence  they are banaras hindu university delhi university and aligarh muslim university  the policy of reservation  is  being  fully  implemented  in  the  bhu  and  delhi  university  while appointing teaching and non teaching staff  but the aligarh muslim university has not  been  implementing  the  reservation  policy  thereby  depriving  sc  and  other backward classes from this benefit  the successive governments of uttar pradesh have  not  raised  this  issue  in  all  these  70  years    if  more  and  more  castes  are included  in  the  list  of  scheduled  caste  like  this  then  the  interest  of  other  caste which are already there in the existing list would be adversely affected because the supreme  court  has  pegged  the  limit  at  50  per  cent    i  therefore  request  the government to consider on this aspect also when any such proposal comes to it in future

__label__callforaction __label__against     i  would  like  the  hon  minister  to clarify on two points  is nuclear power safe and is it cost effective  when we talk about safety we have to look into the fact that we should not set up nuclear power plants  in  those  areas  which  are  heavily  populated  and  those  which  are  prone  to natural disaster   the  nuclear  power plant  of  at village  gorakhpur is  lying  within the radius of 100 kilometers of one of the most earthquake prone belt of kangra  i would  request the hon minister that  he should  conduct  a  study  as  to  whether  the proposed plant in that area will be safe or not  we should deploy the professional people of indian origin for taking care of the safety aspect of nuclear power plants  thorium  is  found  in  abundance  in  our  country    when  we  talk  about  nuclear research are we conducting research on thorium as well  are we looking towards proper  utilization  of  thorium  so  that  we  do  not  become  dependent  on  foreign countries

will be subject to examination by a medical officer  if their residences  are  known  those  people  will  be  taken  to  their  residences    if  their residences  are  not  known  those  people  will  be  taken  to  establishments  for homeless  persons    i  would  like  to  know  from  the  hon  minister  if  he  can  throw some  light  on  vocational  rehabilitation  because  vocational  rehabilitation  has  not been  mentioned  in  the  bill    this  bill  is  very  good  in  the  sense  it  has  covered almost  all  the  aspects  of  a  person  suffering  from  mental  illness    talking  about human  resources  number  of  psychiatrists  in  the  country  as  of  today  is  around 4500    today  in  our  country  we  require  around  12500  psychiatrists    the number  of  psychiatric  nurses  today  is  04  nurses  per  one  lakh  which  is  around 3000    the  number  that  we  require  today  is  around  56000  paramedical personnel    so  i  urge  upon  the  government  that  these  numbers  should  also  be taken  into  consideration  for  effective  implementation  of  this  mental  healthcare bill  medical council of india is the registering body for doctors  for nurses we have  nursing  council    but  for  other  paramedical  staff  there  is  no  designated council  there can be legal issues coming up when the treatment is going on like say  the  paramedical  staff  is  not  registered  under  any  council    so  i  think  we should consider about those councils as well  research is the very important part as far as mental healthcare is concerned  in this the consent of the patient should be  taken  before  doing  any  kind  of  research  on  that  person    so  proper  consent should be taken from the concerned authority if the person is not in a position to give  his  own  consent    another  very  good  provision  in  the  bill  which  is  very much  appreciable  is  inclusion  of  ayush    ayurveda  yoga  and  naturopathy unani  siddha  and  homoeopathy    it  is  appreciable  that  the  national  mental health policy has been announced by hon minister and also keeping in mind that there is shortage of doctors in the country he has provided funding for almost 15 centres  of  excellence  and  35  pg  training  departments    the  district  mental health programme has also been extended to 118 districts in the 12th fiveyear plan in addition to the 123 districts which was initially included in the 11th fiveyear plan  the funds have been almost doubled  the hon minister in his speech mentioned  about  mentallyill  mothers  can  keep their  children with  them   this  is one of my concerns that in some cases like bipolar diseases or schizophrenia it is not advisable that the child should be kept with the mother  so my request is that such cases should be referred to the mental health board which will take a call on whether the children should be kept with the mentallyill mothers or not  lastly i would like to specially thank the hon minister for making a provision in the bill of punishing those people who will not follow the law     dr ratna de nag the bill seeks to protect promote and improve the  rights  of  the  patients  in  need  of  mental  healthcare    as  per  national  crime records  bureau  131666  people  committed  suicide  in  india  in  2014    people commit suicide due to lack of funding lack of human resources and social stigma associated with mental illness  there is a massive shortage of psychiatrists in the public sector  there are some good provisions in the bill also  the provision of appointing  a  nominee  may  lead  to  damaging  the  goodwill  and  bonding  between the  families    furthermore  a  mental  patient  can  only  be  admitted  to  a  mental institution after being reviewed by the mental health review commission  this may  lead  to  undue  delay  in  the  treatment  and  make  the  entire  process  more complicated    the  bill  states  about  electroconvulsive  therapy  ect  in  case  of mental illness of minors  due to serious hazards of electroconvulsive therapy on minors and its controversial practice in the treatment of mental illness in minors a  blanket  ban  on  ect  for  minors  should  be  implemented  as  advised  by  the  world health  organization    the  bill  states  that  medical  records  can  be  accessed  by patients unless it results in causing serious mental harm to the patient  there is no definition  of  what  would  constitute  as  serious  mental  harm  it  is  left  to  the psychiatrists decision  the bill must provide for stringent punishment in cases of falsifying the medical records  the communitybased rehabilitation establishment and  services  for  patients  has  not  been  defined    we  request  the  hon  minister  to include dementia under mental healthcare bill to incorporate one neurologist in the board and the admission and discharge of a mental patient in a mental health insitution  should  be  done  under  the  jurisdiction  of  a  physician    regular  mental health awareness camps should be arranged by the government organizations and nongovernment  organizations  and  to  review  and  assess  that  programme  by  an expert and finally assess analyse the benefit of the programme and the response of the people     
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   the  present  bill is comprehensive  and  includes  access  to  health  care  treatment  rehabilitation insurance  right  to  choice  of  treatment  but  most  importantly  decriminalizes attempt  to  suicide  and  regulates  mental  establishments    these  vulnerable individuals  need  support  and  care    mental  patients  face  social  stigma    public needs to be aware  they need to be accepted in the society and they should not be confined    there  need  to  be  a  budget  for  creating  awareness  through  tv  and media messages etc they need access to mental health care  there are only about 3500  psychiatrists    we  need  more  institutions  like  nimhans    we  need psychologists and they are even more scarce in the country  bill has a provision for insurance cover of mental illness  but irony is that government cannot force insurance  companies  to  cover  such  persons    there  is  a  lacuna  in  the  bill  and  it does  not  protect  the  property  of  the  mentallychallenged  people    another  very important  point  is  to  distinguishing  and  codifying  behavioural  disorder  from mental disorder otherwise criminals will take shelter on this    
__label__defect __label__allegation __label__callforaction __label__for  this is one of the finest drafted bill that i have ever  come  across    things  like  mood  perception  behavioural  disorder  which impairs  judgementa  and  things  which  are  functional  in  nature  should  have  been categorized as behavioural disorder and not as mental illness  the bill talks about only  one  disorder   that  is schizophrenia  though  there  are  five or six disorders  as per the psychiatry association   the government overenthusiastically is trying to classify even the maniac psychosis which is called bipolar disorder as a psychiatry illness      in  psychiatry  the  disorder  most  frequently  seen  is  the  bipolar  disorder and the manic depressive psychosis  the intention of the government seems only to treat a disorder where a person would only threaten himself and the society  i request the hon minister that the definition of mental illness should include mood disorders  behavioural  disorders  perception  disorders  and  those  disorders  which impair the ability of judgment     
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   this  bill  intends  to protect people afflicted with mental problems and redress their suffering  the care and  protection of  the  mentally  disturbed is  the responsibility  of  our  government and  therefore  adequate  financial  provisions  should  also  be  included  in  the  bill  physical health and mental health are both equally important  in recent times there is an increasing trend of mental illness among our children and youth  so we are passing through a phase when mental illness is becoming more widespread in our society  so it is appropriate that the parliament is now accepting and upholding the  rights  of  the  mentally  ill  by  passing  this  bill    various  states  of  our  country have  their  own  mental  health  authorities    but  what  are  the  facilities  that  we provide for the mentally ill in various states  the only national institute which can  be  proud  of  is  the  nimhans  institute  at  bangalore    the  other  state government  hospitals  have  very  limited  facilities    all  the  facilities  for  their treatment  and  rehabilitating  the  mentally  ill  once  they  are  cured  are  equally important  government hospitals are overcrowded  they are like jails  i would say that the poor mental patients are subjected to worse to tortures than are even meted  out  to  prisoners    we  have  to  see  their  plight    even  when  a  patient  is certified as fully cured by a competent doctor the family members of that patient are  not  ready  to  take  him  or  her  back  home    even  after  being  cured  they  are compelled to live with other patients in a mental asylum  my  suggestion is that the  states  have  separate  mental  health  authorities  who  should  identify  the  cured                                                   original in malayalam patients  from  time  to  time  and  help  them  to  rehabilitate  and  if  possible  find employment    a  pension    amount  to  support  them  is  also  essential    there  are social problems  all kinds of drugs are within the reach of our children  so there are factors that disturb the very mental health of our children  lot many children suffer from depression  all states should have nimhans like model institutions for health care  we have to ensure that all states have qualified psychiatrists and psychologists  for this we have to increase the number of psychiatry seats in the pg courses of all medical colleges  i support this bill  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  this bill is almost a flawless bill but there are just a few quick doubts which need more clarity  if the national mental health policy  and  the  mental  healthcare  bill  are  implemented  completely  i  think  it would be a complete winwin situation for all of us so before we reach a level of getting adequate number of psychiatrists could we take help of our health workers or empower the ashas and train them a little bit till we finish off with this  the concept of counselors and psychotherapists needs more clarity  kindly clarify on psychotherapists what you expect out of them and how far they can go in treating them  so i think we need to have very stringent guidelines in this regard because these issues are all chemical imbalances   i think karnataka is   one of the states which  has  come  out  with  the  best  regulations    i  would  request  you  to  see  if alcoholism and drugs could be put into this bill as a mental illness  who will have the authority to exempt under section 65  the other point is about the budget and structure  of  district  level  mental  health  boards    these  boards  need  to  be  far more  active    the  government  should  consider  to  bring  all  the  drugs  that  are required  for  mental  health  in  the  essential  drug  list    the  last  point  is  womencentric  approach      women  do  not  get  help    the  bill  should  be  more  gendersensitive  so  that  women  can  get  treatment    even  in  divorces  and  separation women suffer  so i would take this opportunity to ask the hon minister to kindly clarify some of the doubts because it is a very strong bill     
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  it is evident that diseases relating to food habits lifestyle and profession are continuously rising not only in india but in the whole world also  though after the spread of education  people have become more aware and cautious about their health  but we are not as much aware about our mental health as we are in the case of our physical health  today number of people  suffering  from  depression  is  rising  continuously  in  india  and  all  over  the world  which  is  a  matter  of  grave  concern    there  is  a  need  to  create  awareness about this illness in the indian society  this government is making endeavour to ensure  comprehensive  treatment  of  mental  patients  and  promotion  of  their  rights through  this  bill    in  this  bill  suicide  has  been  decriminalized    besides permission  to  give  shock  treatment  to  mental  patients  can  be  granted  only  after administration of muscle relaxing treatment along with the anesthesia  and these treatment  method  are  prohibited  in  case  of  minor  patients    through  this  bill efforts  would  be  made  to  provide  easy  and  affordable  medical  facilities  to  the mental patients  in addition to that a mental health review commission should be constituted which will be a quasijudicial body  apart from that medical insurance cover should be provided to the mental patients on the same basis as is available for physical illness

__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  it is unfortunate that such a sensitive matter related to the mental patients has been neglected so far  now this government has brought comprehensive bill in this regard  it is a fact that awareness has increased with  regard  to  mental  illness  in  the  urban  areas  but  still  there  are  many  people suffering  from  mental  illness  in  the  villages  of  our  country  because  rural  people are  not  aware  of  and  sensitive  towards  mental  illness    illiteracy  and  poverty  are also  the  main  reasons  behind  mental  illness    during  2010  number  of  people suffering  from  mental  illness  were  2  crore  which has now  reached  upto  13  crore and as per the estimates by 2020 their number is likely to be increased to 25 crore   the  concerns  being  expressed  over  this  disease  in  this  house  and  the  extent  to which  this  bill  is  garnering  peoples  support  are  the  manifestations  of  the  inner compassion    this  bill  enshrines  all  the  provisions  regarding  the  protections  and rights  of  the  persons  suffering  from  mental  disorder    the  detailed  clarifications regarding  the  representative  will  benefit  the  patient  a  lot    a  mass  awareness  is also required to be created about this disease

__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  would  like  to  congratulate  the  hon minister  for  bringing  the  mental  healthcare  bill  2016  as  it  is  a  welcome  move  this is the good thing that all the persons suffering from mental disorders will be able to get medical coverage after the bill is passed   in this respect i would like to  make  a  request  that  a  person  attempting  to  commit  suicide  should  be  given treatment  instead  of  registering  a  criminal  case  against  him    the  hon  minister should pursue this matter with the ministry of law in order to make provisions to this  effect    the  insurance  companies  should  be  given  strict  orders  facilitating proper treatment of such patients at an affordable premium  we will have to make proper  budgetary  provision  for  the  treatment  of  such  patients  in  201718  budget  a  punitive  provision  of  this  bill  providing  for  imprisonment  of  six  months  or  a penalty  of  rs10000  or  both  for  the  noncompliance  of  the  provision  is insufficient according to me  at the same time the persons suffering from mental stress can also be accommodated by converting nirbhaya kendras into counseling centres    
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  i would like to extend special thanks to  the  hon minister  for  bringing  a  bill  for  taking  care of  such  persons  that  have none to take care of them  the number of persons suffering from mental disorders is  increasing  day  by  day  the  increasing  number  of  mental  patients  can  be attributed  to  a  number  of  factors  but  the  facility  of  mobile  and  internet  is  also responsible  for  the  situation    moreover  no  criminal  cases  should  be  registered against those who attempts to commit suicide due to mental tension  i would like to  request  the  minister  to  set  up  hospitals  in  every  state  and  doctors  should  be deployed  therein    the  facility  of  insurance  cover  should  also  be  provided  to  the mental patients so that there may be an improvement in their lives   
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  though i support this bill my point which i want the hon minister to consider is that in this particular bill there is no clear mention about the drug rehabilitation centre  this bill is completely silent on care of  persons  with  mental  illness  in  the  community    my  suggestion  is  that  a provision  of  psychiatrist  or  a  clinical  psychologist  at  all  primary  healthcare centres should be made  another  point is the process of licence  i urge upon the government to consider this whole insistence on having a licence  let me remind the  hon  minister  that  these  advanced  directives  will  be  counterproductive  and this  will  lead  to  many  issues    coming  to  the  nominative  representative  the  bill needs  to  make  provision  that  at  least  one  member  needs  to  be  present  with  the patient during the inpatient treatment  it is not required that the judiciary should be  part  of  this  mental  health  review  board    my  suggestion  would  be  that  this board  should  comprise  of  independent  psychiatrists  family  care  givers  and recovered  patients    i  propose  to  create  a  board  of  visitors  at  each  hospital    as regards right to confidentiality my suggestion is that this information should only be given to the family members and that too in verbal form    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  congratulate  both  the  governments the  upa  government  and the  nda  government  for  bringing  such  a comprehensive bill to protect and promote the interests of persons having mental disorder this is a perfect legislation  it is surprising to know that in india six to seven per cent of the population is suffering from mental illness  but the medical infrastructure available to address to address mental illness is very poor  as result over 50 per cent of the mentally ill persons in india do not have access to mental healthcare  so  mental  healthcare  social  stigma  and  discrimination  and  also rehabilitation are aspects which are well addressed in the mental healthcare bill 2016    i  am  now  coming  to  the  provisions  of  the  bill    i  would  like  to  seek  a clarification  from  the  hon  minister  whether  we  will  be  able  to  implement  the mental  health  care  as  stipulated  in  clauses  21o  of  the  bill    given  the  wider scope  of  the  definition  of  mental  illness  as  enumerated  in  clauses  21s  of  the bill  i  would  also  like  to  ask  whether  the  government  with  the  limited  existing infrastructure  would  be  able  to  implement  these  provisions  in  practice    i  would appreciate the hon minister as  well as the government regarding section 309 of the  india  penal  code  that  is  decriminalization  of  the  attempt  to  commit  suicide which is provided in clause 115 of the bill  it is a very progressive and a logical provision regarding  suicide it  is very  interesting to  note  that  in india  suicide is one among the top ten causes of death  that is why the law commission in its 210th report had recommended and suggested for decriminalization of attempt to commit  suicide  i  have  moved  13  amendments  which  will  help  the  government and make the provisions more clear  i fully and wholeheartedly support this bill

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  i support the child labour prohibition and  regulation  amendment  bill  with  certain  reservations  child  labour  is  the outcome  of  socioeconomic  conditions  prevailing  in  our  society  the  two  main socioeconomic factors which are having direct link to the child labour are poverty and education it is shameful for the whole country that 4533 lakh children in the age  group  of  five  to  fourteen  years  are  working  even  after  seven  decades  of independence  we  are  not  able  to  have  total  literacy  and  total  preliminary  or elementary  education  to  all  children  below  the  age  of  14  years  we  have  to strengthen  public  education  system  and  provide  all  the  facilities  like  clothing uniform food study materials and even monthly stipend should be provided to all the children particularly  to those children who are living below the poverty the proposed  amendment  bill  is  not  sufficient  to  meet  the  requirements  to  contain child  labour  in  our  country  the  major  conventions  of  international  labour organisation  have  not  been  taken  into  account  in  the  proposed  amendment  bill regarding  the  hazardous  occupation  the  list  of  work  has  been  copied  from  the factories  act all  those processes  which  jeopardise  the  health  safety  and  morals of  adolescents  should  come  within  the  purview  of  hazardous  job  or  hazardous work  rescued  children  should  be  properly  rehabilitated  i  welcome  that  a  child rehabilitation  fund  has  been  constituted  all  errant  employers  should  be  fined parents and guardians shall not be punished for allowing their children to work in hazardous  industries  because  the  poor  workers    the  agricultural  worker  do  not know  which  is  hazardous  and  which  is  not  a  comprehensive  policy  on  child labour is highly essential and the government should come out with such a policy   
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against  this bill prohibits children up to 14 years of age from working in any occupation however it allows them to work in home based work and those working in the audio visual industry i can only say that we cannot change  the  situation  through  legislation  alone  this  requires  a  huge  amount  of social change and movement which can come about if we are able to build a lot of awareness but unfortunately this bill does not encompass the iec provision that is  the  information  education  and  communication  aspects  they  are  not  made mandatory if we make it mandatory for all state governments it would help us in getting  rid  of  child  labour then population  stabilization  is  the  need of  the  hour finally  i  would  like  to  say  that  we  also  need  to  ensure  that  the  conviction  rate which is less than 10 per cent goes up   
__label__defect __label__allegation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  am  on  my  legs  to speak  on  the  child  labour  prohibition  and  regulation  amendment  bill  2016 however  this  debate  does  not  hold  much  significance  as  the  government  enjoys here full majority  the child labour amendment bill provides for prohibition on the employment  of  the  children  below  14  years  in  all  sorts  of  work  provided  this ceases  to  be  applicable  in  the  cases  where  children  help  their  family  or  family enterprises  after  school  hour  or  during  holidays    but  the  government  forgot  that only relatives have been found guilty   in most of the cases of forcing the children to work it has also been accepted that children can work from 46 hours  but who will  ensure  as  to  how  long  they  are  working    whether  the  bureaucracy  or  the police  who  intends  to  earn  benefit  in  collusion  with  those  business  men  and  the corporate world  i would like to reiterate that no one cares for the children because they  are not voters  the  children  have  been put to  commercialization   it  sounds very good in black and white that the extent of penalty has been increased but only 4474  persons  have  been  brought  to  book  since  the  enforcement  of  child  labour act 1986  it is a matter of shame that the penalty imposed for the violation of the said  act  was  merely  rs  20  and  rs  25    hence  only  increasing  the  extent  of penalty  is  not  going  to  stop  the  exploitation  of  the  children  in  the  country  according  to  the  government  figure  there  are  only  50  lakh  child  labour  in  the country whereas the 2011 census reveals that the number of child labour was 125 crore  thus  it  is  nothing  but  the  maneuvering  of  the  government  figure    now  i would like to talk about  their  rehabilitation   the  children  rescued  from  the  child labour should have been properly rehabilitated  it is claimed that the rehabilitation scheme  is  being  implemented  in  66  districts  of  the  country  but  the  number  of beneficiary children is only 6 lakh  although this bill prohibits the employment of children in certain hazardous industries and factories the hazardous work has not been  defined  therein    furthermore  the  ministry  of  home  affairs  do  not  put  the begging  children  into  the  category  of  child  labour    to  me  this  subject  does  not belong  only  to  the  ministry  of  labour    the  ministry  of  human  resource development  niti  ayog  the  ministry  of  labour  the  ministry  of  finance  the ministry of social justice should have brooded over it collectively  this stands to be  a  great  responsibility  of  the  government  towards  them    like  china  our population is also burgeoning  but we do not want to toe its line  the government should invest in the education of the children as the report of the world bank also admits  that  if  they  learn  the  basics  read  and  write  the  growth  rate  of  gdp  will increase by 037 per cent annually  in 10 years only on the basis of education gdp will grow by 10 percent  hence first of all the government should have provided food to those poor people who put their children to work for a square meal instead of  bringing  this  amendment  in  order  to  provide  benefit  to  the  corporate  and industry world  the government talks about the elimination of the child labour and at the same time promotes family enterprises   prostitution and the exploitation of the  children  have  been  encouraged  in  the  name  of  family  enterprises  by  this amendment  this bill does not provide for the liberation of those children who are working  in  the  unorganized  sector    this  is  a  serious  issue  and  hence  the government  should  think  about  the  children  cutting  across  the  political  line  and accept the suggestions made by the people like kailash satyarthi

__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   we  have  only  five  national  waterways  even  after many  years  since  independence  and  the  state  of  these  waterways  is  not  quite satisfactory    i  would  really  say  that  this  bill  is  a  big  leap  in  this  direction    the government has announced 101 new national inland waterways and this is really a  revolutionary  step    the  sone  punpun  koshi  gandak  rivers  have  also  been included under the national waterways  we are really grateful to the government for this  our waterways were better managed before independence as we used the sone  river  as  waterway  earlier    we  would  use  canals  for  transportation  goods  this  bill  would  definitely  expedite  the  pace  of  development  of  waterways    we would  also  like  to  request  to  develop  our  old  waterways    a  big  canal  from  the sone river from dehri to patna used to be a centre of business activity earlier and it had  a  great  potential  for  navigation    similarly  the  canals  from  the  gandak  river should  also  be  included  under  the  waterways  as  these  would  facilitate transportation of goods and would also reduce pressure on roads  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  this bill seems to be a very good one  we should promote shipping and navigation  the objective of this bill is  to  reduce  the  cost  of  transportation  as  also  the  risk  of  accidents  on  national highways  this would also boost tourism  bihar is a backward state  i therefore request the hon minister to take care of bihar in this regard  the sultanganj ghat in bhagalpur should be given the status of a port  i also request the hon minister to construct more national highways in the state    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   this  bill  was  much  required the objective of this bill is to reduce transportation cost as also promote tourism  we have two three apprehensions about this bill with regard to our state punjab  the  hon  minister  should  take  note  of  the  same    the  irrigation  projects  which would come up under the national waterways should be under the control of the concerned  state  itself    the  chenab  jhelum  and  ravi  rivers  should  also  be included under the national waterways  the mineral department creates hurdles in  desilting  of  sutlej  and  beas  rivers  and  thereby  causing  floods  by  these  rivers  therefore  this  aspect  should  also  be  taken  into  consideration    the  ganga  canal should also be included under the national waterways  the sarhind canal should also be revived because this canal has a vast potential of becoming a waterway    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   the  development of  such  waterways  network will require dredging of the river system to increase the depth causing substantial changes  in  river  system  has  any  study  been  done  to  ascertain  the  environmental impact of such development on the eco system and aquatic life of the river does such  development  lead  to  changes  in  the  flood  plains  of  the  river  affecting  their productivity and agricultural capacity as also productivity of the nation

__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for     by  making  this  legislation  we are  making  a  very  effective  and  welcome  move    if  this  bill  is  passed  and  then implemented properly in a timebound manner it goes without saying that that will revolutionize the transport sector  it is a safe cost effective and an environmental friendly mode of transport  there are anxieties to be addressed in this bill  water level  and  the  sustainability  are  in  a  dangerous  position    even  rivers  are disappearing    we  have  to  be  very  careful  in  handling  this  kind  of  situation  another  anxiety  is  about  the  formalities  in  getting  permission    i  hope  the government  would  constitute  an  exclusive  cell  for  this  purpose    the  subject water is in the concurrent list  hence the ministry should take the views of the state government into consideration  the issue of low lying bridges and structures in the rivers is also an important issue and the same may be addressed  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i would like to thank the hon minister that he has declared 106 waterways by adding 101 new waterways  this mode of transportation is only going to prove beneficial  it is a cheap and convenient mode of  transport  environmentfriendly  and  employment  oriented    this  will  give  us freedom  from  traffic jams  and it  will also give  a  boost to the  tourism   there  are rivers like kosi and gandak in north bihar which have sufficient quantity of water throughout the year  the use of these rivers in developing the waterways can be very  economical  and  effective    i  would  like  to  tell  that  river  punpun  falls  in  my parliamentary constituency  the hon minister is talking about developing 35 km flow of this river as waterways  i would like suggest that the waterway should be increased upto the level of the origin of the river or to any feasible point  besides  there is a mention of developing waterway upto 160 km in river son  this should also be increased    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   through this  bill the  government propose  to  increase  the  number  of  waterways  from  the  present  5  to  106      the condition of even existing waterways is pathetic and no substantial traffic is taking place  through  them    i  would  like  to  request  the  government  that  present waterways should be interconnected with the railways roads and ports which will automatically  increase  the  transportation    the  flow  of  water  in  our  rivers  is dependent on nature and the flow of water in them is not constant throughout the year    without  taking  into  consideration  this  aspect  the  implementation  of waterways transportation seems very difficult  even the experts are of the opinion that  too  much  expansion  of  waterways  will  result  in  increased  danger  of  water pollution because the pollution caused by the emission of water vessels will result in  pollution  of  water  bodies      it  is  very  essential  to  consider  over  these  points before we develop our waterways    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   while on one hand this bill is certainly going to boost to the trade on the other it will also result in creation of a lot of facilities from the point of view of tourism transportation and protection of environment  i would  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  house  towards  my  constituency    a waterway  has  been  declared  at  point  no  40  which  will  originate  at  faizabad starting from river ghaggar further going through river ganga and reaching upto the confluence of river ghaggar  i would like to request the hon minister that the waterway  which  he  wants  to  start  from  faizabad  should  be  started  from lakhimpur because the construction of a border road along that waterway has been announced  this will pave the way for this national waterway to take the shape of international waterway

__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   waterways  can  play  a  very  important  role  in the  development  of  the  country  because  water  transportation  is  one  of  the  most important  alternative  mode  of  transportation  as  far  as  cost  effectiveness consumption of fuel and ecofriendly measures are concerned  through this bill the government seeks to develop rivers of the country into waterways and there is a  proposal  of  developing  approximately  101  rivers  into  waterways    this  will reduce  the  burden  of  traffic  on  railways  and  surface  transportation    it  will  also result in economic growth of the country  it will reduce the poverty in the country  if all those rivers are included for developing waterways whose names have been suggested by the hon member of bihar then it would be a welcome step

__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  i am glad to speak on this  bill  as  i  started  my  professional  career  as  software  engineer    i  would  like  to know  from  the  hon  minister  of  human  resource  development  about  the  two  iiit projects one of which was already set up in amethi and the other was to be set up in sonepat  what are the reasons for closing down iiit amethi and it being shifted to allahabad  alongwith  its  students    the  proposed  iiit  sonepat  lies  in  my parliamentary  constituency  whose  foundation  was  laid  by  pallam  raju  ji  and choudhary bhupinder singh hooda ji in 2003  even the work thereon was started  but  the  work  was  stopped  just  after  the  change  in  the  government    i  am  talking about  the  two  lok  sabha  parliamentary  constituency  where  the  members  of parliament  are  from  the opposition   i  would  like  to  request the  minister  of  human resource  development  to  tell  about  the  reasons  for  the  works  not  being  started  for these  two  iiits  and  their  campuses  were  not  set  up  whereas  the  work  on  the remaining iiits is going on  it sector is a very crucial sector  but over a period of time  the  capacity  of  this  sector  to  provide  employment  has  waned    the  economic slowdown as well as the increasing protectionist policy of the countries like usa are responsible for this situation  the restrictions imposed by the usa on its h1b visa policy are specially responsible for this  the prime minister himself should come forward to clarify if he has taken up the matter with the usa during his recent visit to relax  the  restrictions  placed  on  h1b  visa  policy    if  this  is  not  done  the  it professionals  of  india  will  have  to  face  many  difficulties  to  work  in  the  usa    i would also like to suggest that this bill does not provide for the establishment of the extension centres of iiits  hence such provisions should be incorporated in this bill enabling  the  establishment  of  extension  centres  of  the  flagship  iiits  like  iiit bengaluru  and  iiit  hyderabad  so  that  the  students  of  this  area  may  also  get admission  therein    the  most  significant  feature  of  the  it  sector  is  that  it  does  not require  big  infrastructure  for  its  establishment    india  dominates  56  per  cent  of  it trade  in  the  world  due  to  our  silicon  valley  as  compared  to  the  usa    the  prime minister should say that if the silicon valley of california is showing the path to the world then the bengaluru has gone a little ahead of it  at this point in time things appear  to  have  been  left  on  their  own  in  the  it  sector  due  to  which  the  situation  is going from bad to worse  so this needs to be changed    
__label__appreciation __label__for  india  has  been  recognized  world  over  as  the  it  soft  power  to  promote  this  it industry  we  provided  iiits  in  government  sector    later  on  it  was  felt  that  there should be publicprivate partnership and 20 such iiits with publicprivate partnership were  mooted  in 2010   now nearly  15 iiits  are  already  operational  in the  country  this year their students will be graduating for the first time and iiit bill provides for granting  degrees  to  their  students    but  iiit  publicprivate  partnership  mode  is  a different  mode  because  there  are  different  stakeholders    in  iiits  it  is  only  the central  government  but  in  iiitppp  it  is  the  central  government  the  state government and the private sector  so instead of amending the law we have brought this bill and i believe that this bill will be passed unanimously  we will consider all the good suggestions made in this regard  
__label__allegation __label__callforaction __label__for   this  bill  provides  for  establishment  of institutes  through  collaboration  among  the  centre  the  state  government  and  the industry  partners    the  capital  investment  has  to  be  borne  in  the  ratio  of  503515 among  the  centre  the  state  government  and  the  industry  partner    as  the  state government has to give land measuring between 50 acres and 100 acres free of cost the  expected  capital  investment  for  states  may  be  reduced  to  20  per  cent  and  the centre  may  increase its  own  share to 65 per  cent keeping  the  share  of the  industry unchanged    we  welcome  the  initiative  of  the  government  of  opting  for  the  ppp mode for developing such institutions this mode of ppp should be extended to the selffinanced institutions in the engineering and medical fields also  the government may  think  over  it  and  bring  in  a  comprehensive  bill  for  this  purpose  in  future    i would like to take this opportunity to point two issues firstly confusion was created as  grace  marks  were  given  this  year  to  the  12th  class  students  of  cbse    though everybody  agrees  that  there  should  be  normalisation  in  marks  one  similar  set procedure  is  not  followed  throughout  the  country    secondly  every  board  has different  set  of  procedures  for  doing  this    unless  we  have  common  syllabus  and common  board  there  cannot  be  clarity  on  this  issue  and  there  cannot  be  any equalization in studies and marks  so i would urge the government to firstly ponder over this aspect    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  rise  to  speak  in  favour  of  the indian institutes of information technology publicprivate partnership bill 2017  i would  like  to  congratulate  the  hon  minister  of  human  resource  development  for bringing such a visionary and historical bill  this bill will certainly usher in a new era of education research and expansion in the sector of information technology in the country  this bill is also significant for us as it will facilitate the emergence of such  a  farreaching  effective  and  strong  mechanism  of  the  information  technology education in the country which will cater to not only our needs but will also prove our strategic  excellence  in  the  field  of  information  technology  all  over  the  world    the issues  like  the  definition  of  public  private  partnership  the  manner  of  its establishment the  ways  of  coordination  among  the  center states  and  industries the manner  of  mooting  the  proposal  by  the  union  government  and  the  manner  of preparing  mou  for  it  and  the  role  of  industry  partners  etc  have  been  lucidly explained  in  different  clauses  of  this  bill    the  work  has  also  been  done  for  the mobilization of funds for these institutes  the information technology has certainly played  pivotal  role  in  achieving  remarkable  economic  progress  as  the  information technology contributes about 10 percent of our gdp  according to nasscom this sector  is  going  to  create  30  lakh  new  employment  opportunities  by  the  year  2025  this  bill  will  to  be  a  revolutionary  step  for  the  world  and  will  usher  in  a  new  era  this bill seeks to provide legitimacy to their degrees conferred upon their students as well  as  to  provide  legal  status  to  these  15  institutes  of  ppp  mode    these  institutes will  automatically  get  their  autonomy  having  been  declared  as  institutes  of  national importance    this  will  also  facilitate  the  creation  of  conducive  atmosphere  for research  on  their  education    this  bill  also  seeks  to  establish  better  coordination through autonomy and accountability and to set up the excellent academic institutes of  information  technology    how  to  prepare  our  students  our  faculties  and  our scientists on global standards is also the fundamental objective of this bill  25 lakh villages have been envisaged to be brought under the ambit of digital india and this also stands reinforced through this bill  this bill specially provides for formulation of a strategy to be adopted by these 15 institutes to mobilize their funds and execute the  same  to  become  an  autonomous  body    this  will  turn  out  to  be  crucial  in  the employment  creation  also    i  would  like  to  conclude  with  this  request  that  an  iiit should be set up in uttarakhand also   
__label__defect __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for     i  support  this  bill    although  this  bill  is  about iiits  it  concerns  higher  education    everyone  demands  iits  iims  iiits  and institutes  of  higher  education  but  nobody  talks  about  the  quality  of  education  we have entrance tests but not exit tests  the amount of money being wasted because of  inferior  teaching  and  training  levels  is  mindboggling    corporations  would  save much  if  the  passouts  are  effective  and  readily  employable    that  will  definitely benefit the indian economy immediately  this bill appears to be a step in the right direction  by allowing industry participation in management of iits we will ensure that the right kind of exposure is provided to students before they pass out  the bill proposes a ratio of 503515 for the central state and private investors respectively  it would be better if this set of ratio is not  mentioned in the law but issued through regulations  after  the  law  is  passed    it  would  be  beneficial  because  then  the government  can  moderate  the  share  of  each  parties  according  to  the  conditions prevalent  in  future    teacher  recruitment  is  becoming  a  serious  problem  in  higher education  institutes  the  pay  for  the  teaching  jobs  needs  to  be  increased  and  made more and more attractive to encourage passing out students to take up teaching jobs  regional  languages  should  be  promoted  in  these  institutes  it  would  go  a  long  way towards attracting local talent  indias strength is in its diversity and language plays a big role   
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   the  bill  proposes  to  set  up  indian institute  of  information  technology  in  publicprivate  partnership  mode    in  this model there will be autonomy in governance that will help in addressing the present challenges  faced  by  the  indian  information  technology  industry  in  our  country    it will  help  in  growth  of  the  domestic  information  technology  market  including developing new knowledge areas and creating skilled manpower of global standards  it  is  extremely  necessary  that  we  create  worldclass  education  centres  to  develop skilled  manpower  in  emerging  sectors    fifteen  functional  indian  institutes  of information  technology  in  public  private  partnership  mode  are  proposed  to  be declared  as  institutes  of  national  importance    the  government  hopes  that  trained personnel from these institutes shall fulfill the growing demand for skilled technical manpower in emerging it sectors and the economy as a whole  establishing iiits in public  private  partnership  and  subsequently  declaring  them  as  institute  of  national importance  would  help  in  providing  worldclass  education  to  students  to  foster research and development and make the way for india becoming a worldclass leader  i  would  request  the  hon  minister  of  human  resource  development  to  please  note that  the  kalyani  iiit  west  bengal  has no  permanent  building   also parity  in  feestructure  among  the  different  iiits  would  help  in  promoting  standardization  and equality  i  would  like  to  request  the  government  to  clarify  that  if  government funding  is  only  for  five  years  what  will  happen  thereafter    these  institutions  may increase the fee making it difficult for the poor students   
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  think  it  is  the  first  time  in  the  country  that educational  institutions  are  coming  up  in  public  private  partnership  through legislation  through this bill we are now going to empower these institutes to grant degrees  so  that  the  degrees  can  be  accepted  through  a  statute    i  think  it  would  be better if private partners get a levelplaying field in making decisions  i am happy to note  that  the  reservation  system  will  be  implemented  in  these  institutions    i  am happy to see from the bill that the government is going to give scholarships and also going  to  fund  the  institutes  for  the  benefit  of  economically  backward  students  and also  meritorious  students    but  i  would  like  to  know  whether  funding  by  the government is limited only to five years  i hope that the government will permit us to submit our proposal and sanction one institute to the state of telangana  we need one institute under this new act for our new state of telangana in my constituency karimnagar   
__label__callforaction __label__for   while  implementing  public  private  partnership the government has to think very seriously about it  it may create hurdle for the poor people   brain drain occurs  due to  lack  of  opportunities  and less remuneration   so not only employment opportunities will have to be created but more salary also  the bill  with  a  very  good  intention  gives  more  and  more  opportunities  to  the  students who want to go for engineering and particularly information technology   
__label__callforaction __label__for   we  are  talking  about  these  institutions  at  a  time when  this  industry  is  going  through  a  major  crisis    everywhere  there  are retrenchments  in  the  it  industry    i  doubt  whether  these  indian  institutes  of information technology which are intended for it will have any future because the content  of information  technology  always  has a  short shelf life    therefore i  am  of the  strong opinion there should be an intensive training on  the  robotics  or  artificial intelligence    these  are  the  ones  which  definitely  have  an  edge  over  the  routine information  technology  therefore  robotics  artificial  intelligence  divergent  and unconventional things of it industry should also be a part of this curriculum  instead of  making it  industry  a  job  seeker let  us  make  it as entrepreneurs so that  they  can provide jobs to the youth  we should always remember it industry as a revolution  in kakinada an iiit was inaugurated five year back  it has just stopped there only  i would  request  the  hon  minister  to  look  into  the  matter  as  to  why  this  has  been stopped and request him to rejuvenate it  i would request him to give top priority to new things allotted to andhra pradesh and give some academic importance to andhra pradesh on the indian map    
__label__allegation __label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  think  this  bill  will  have  farreaching  implication  in  the field  of  higher  education  particularly  the  engineering  education  in  our  country    i strongly object to the reduction in the number of reserved seats in these institutions  a recent report which appeared in the newspaper said that in 2017 itself nine per cent drop out has happened in iiits  they are mainly from the reserved categories  the vacancies  reserved  for  teaching  faculty  in  the  iiits  are  still  not  filled  up    the government  is  going  to  move  their  control  completely  and  hand  over  these institutions to the private market  that will not help our future generation  i request the  government  to  rethink  and  reframe  the  entire  bill  and  give  adequate representation in teaching faculty and student seats in these institutions so that we can create  more  engineering  students  and  more  responsible  persons  in  the  engineering filed in the future  we produce more than eight lakh engineering students every year but  the  unemployment  in  the  engineering  sector  is  60  per  cent    i  request  the government to give utmost importance to creating jobs    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for   through  this  bill  certain  indian  institutes of information technology established under publicprivate partnership are proposed to  be  declared  as  institutions  of  national  importance  the  main  objective  is  to develop  new  knowledge  in  information  technology  and  to  provide  manpower  of global  standards    these  iiit  are  being  empowered  to  award  degrees    this  will enhance  the  prospects  of  the  graduating  students  in  the  job  market    i  welcome  the governments decision to set up an iiit in andhra pradesh  the autonomy provided to  develop  its  own  academic  programmes  including  curriculum  new  courses  and method  of  assessment  will  help  in  meeting  the  student  aspirations  and  industry requirements  the number of phds produced in india is small when compared to the vast  population    india  is  also  gaining  prominence  in  terms  of  intellectuals  capital with several global it firms setting up their innovation in the country  in view of the recent  initiatives  taken  by  us  and  certain  other  countries  our  it  industry  is  getting affected and thereby many of our software professionals jobs are at risk and majority of these professionals belong to the telugu states  i request the government to take steps  to  address  their  concerns  and  take  up  the  issue  with  appropriate  authorities  though we have made progress in setting up institutions of higher learning they are not  able  to  cope  up  with  the  growing  population    however  to  be  able  to  lift  a population of 450 million out of poverty and to have them participate in the countrys economic development higher education needs to be a priority  
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__against   in  principle  i  oppose  this  concept  of having  public  private  partnership  in  higher  education  sector    i  fully  agree  with  the hon  minister  that  it  is  a  necessity  and  urgency    we  have  already  commenced  15 iiits    to  confer  the  statutory  status  to  these  educational  institutions  is  need  of  the hour    but  the  only  point  is  that  this  iiit  should  give  access  to  the  poor  children belonging to bpl and the common people of this country  in clause 3 subclause b the board in relation to any institute means the board of governors referred to in  subsection1  of  section  14    this  is  not  a  pure  and  clear  definition  in  clause  my  next  point  is  this    this  is  a  selffinancing  institute    i  agree  with  this  503515 ratio  but the capital expenditure will be borne by the government of india for five years    subsequent  to  the  said  five  years  who  will  finance  these  institutes  definitely it will be a selffinancing institute  what is the fate of the selffinancing institute    i  can  share  my  experience  in  my  state    we  have  started  selffinancing colleges  and  engineering  colleges  are  started  like  anything    now  the  hon  high court has come to a verdict that most of the colleges have a result of less than 10 per cent and the entire higher education scenario is in peril  resources have to be found within the organization  that means the fees will be very high and the poor children or the poor students will not be able to afford the fee structure    
__label__callforaction __label__for  this amendment bill concerns with our industry and economy  we have to give opportunity to everyone by linking skill  development  to  human  resource    skilled  workers  and  labourers  are  the backbone of our country and our economy as well  we have to give more importance to skill knowledge instead of degrees  we have to strengthen our rural economy by giving opportunities to the poor and this can be done by the centre states and private sector together  our population has been increasing therefore it would be better for us to promote iiits to boost our economy    
__label__appreciation __label__for  today knowledge is power  i am very proud that i am coming from karnataka where the famous engineer shri m visvesvaraya has contributed much for the countrys development since before independence in the field  of  technology    i  am  proud  to  say  that  the  visvesvaraya  technological university is there which caters to the needs of the entire karnataka  today it is one of the famous institutes  it was a selffinancing institute under the state government  now we are going in for publicprivate partnership  i request the hon minister for hrd  and  the  hon  finance  minister  to  look  into  the  grievances  of  the  university  engineering  students  should  not  become  job  seekers  they  should  become  job creators  under the hon prime ministers dream initiative of make in india plenty of  opportunities  are  available  for  engineers  today    so  they  should  go  for manufacturing  sector    there  are  other  areas  like  naval  base  agriculture  and  food processing  which  offer  plenty  of  opportunities  for  the  engineers    i  once  again congratulate  the  hon  prime  minister  and  the  hrd  minister  for  introducing  a  bill relating to iiits these 15 institutes should be recognized at the world level for their excellence  they should give better service to india and to the world    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  this bill would take iiits to a new level  i  would like to know  whether the  government  is  going  to  make  provisions  through which even the students belonging to the poor section of the society would be able to study  in  these  industry  supported  institutes    i  would  also  like  to  know  as  to  under which model the government envisage to develop the infrastructure and mobilize the funds if we are to set up 20 such institutes in the country even though 35 per cent of this stake would be shared by the government  i would also like to know from the hon minister whether the large industries which are going to contribute 15 per cent stake will be forced to go for the development of technology  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   a  proposal  was  passed  on  7  december 2010 by the union cabinet announcing 20 iiits to be started under the publicprivate partnership but only 15 iiits started functioning out of them  but these institutes are not empowered to grant degrees  a provision to this effect has been made in this bill for which i congratulate the hon minister  i would request that one iiit should also be set up in kolhapur  kolhapur is also an industrial hub as many big companies like the kirlosker raymonds are based there  if we open such an institute there it would create job opportunity for 2025 thousand people    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   i  would  like  to  state  that  this  addition  of  this  ppp mode in the indian institutes of information technology is adding to the overall ecosystem  of  information technology  and  software services  in our  country  and  also the capability  for  building  human  capital  that  is  required  in  the  21st  century    in  the northeastern  states  the  investment  ratio  today  is  at  575  by  the  central government  35  per  cent  by  the  state  government  and  75  per  cent  by  the  private entity    we  would  request  that  this  be  changed  to  825  per  cent  from  the  central government  10  per  cent  from  the  state  government  and  75  per  cent  from  the private entity  
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for  the resources of public institutions are limited in the field of higher education  under such circumstances the participation of  private  entities  is  absolutely  essential  so  that  good  quality  education  could  be imparted  as  per  the  requirement  of  the  modern  needs    the  bhagalpur  engineering college  is  going  to  start  the  registration  of  the  batch  for  the  year  201718  under which only two subjects are going to be offered  the registration of only 60 students has  been  made    i  would  like  to  request  that  sanction  may  be  accorded  for  the registration of three hundred students as has been proposed by the state government and the study of four subjects should be started in the college    
__label__appreciation __label__callforaction __label__for   there  are  four  objectives  of this bill  firstly to give national importance to the institutes  secondly the sanction for setting up the institutes under the ppp mode  thirdly the bill is geared towards opening new streams of knowledge by establishing these institutes  fourthly the bill is also oriented in the direction of preparing manpower as per the global requirements of the industry  the setting up of the institutes of national importance will increase employability in the country  if we talk in terms of the four top it companies of the country  they  spend  about  rs  1723  crore  annually  on  training    if  the  expenditure meant  for  training  of  the  candidates  is  done  through  institutes  and  if  the  training  is imparted through the same institutes then it is going to save upto six months to one year of time of the students which they have to waste after finishing their education  by this view point this bill is a commendable step    
__label__defect __label__callforaction __label__for  i would like to know from the government as to what is the role of the private institutions which are involved in it  what benefits will they get  in what way we will be benefited by their participation  so my request to the central  government  is  that  either  the  stake  of  the  central  government  should  be increase or the stake of the state government be decreased  in the recent scenario thousands of it  graduates are jobless  an info park or a techno park should be set up  in  the  same  institution  in  which  they  study  so  that  they  can  be  given  the information of placement and training there
