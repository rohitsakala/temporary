  All  the  backward  and  the  poor  are 

looking towards him with hope as he himself is from the poor family.  He said that 

he would provide pucca houses to each and every poor.  What happened to it?  Even 

the colonies of Delhi are also deprived of the facilities of roads, water and drainage 

system.    Measures  are  required  to  be  taken  to  remove  the  urban  unemployment  in 

Bihar.    At  the  same  time,  the  issue  of  child  labour  also  needs  to  be  addressed.    A 

large  corpus  of  fund  should  be  provided  to  Bihar  Sharif  of  my  Parliamentary 

Constituency, Nalanda under National Urban Livelihood Mission.
