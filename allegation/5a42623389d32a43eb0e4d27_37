  If  the  Government  desires  to  bring 

amendments  to  the  Child  Labour  Bill,  2012,  then  there  should  be  further 

improvement in it. The Government has put the explanation clause in the definition 

of  a  family.  It  will  not  be  beneficial  to  the  children.  I  request  the  Minister  to 

remove  the  penalty  clauses  5  and  6  as  the  Bill  was  passed  in  2012  unanimously. 

The  Government  is  bringing  new  amendments  in  the  Bill  which  is  not  going  to 

help.  By  doing  so,  the  Government  instead  of  helping  the  children  and  bringing   

them out of child labour, putting their future in peril.
