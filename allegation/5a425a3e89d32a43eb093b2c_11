  I  would  like  to  draw  the 

attention of the hon. Minister towards two or three points.  First is that an estimated 

3,609 students, who are still pursuing the courses from the institution or like to go 

for job hunting, are uncertain about their degree status.  What is the present status 

of those deprived students?  What effective measures are the government is going 

to  take  to  regularize  those  students  so  as  to  get  their  diplomas  and  degrees?  

Second is about poor quality of training material; no money for factory visits; and 

irregularities  in  admissions  and  placements.    These  are  some  charges  that  FDDI 

students  have  leveled  against  the  authorities.    The  Footware  Design  and 

Development  Institute  was  supposed  to  have  been  made  the  centre  of  excellence 

but instead of strengthening it with the latest market, industrial studies and research 

had  development  the  government  has  converted  it  into  mere  money  making  or 

money  minting  ordinary  college.    Even  they  have  alleged  that  fees  by  the  FDDI 

management  were  charged  irrationally.    The  average  placed  salary  instead  of 

increasing,  have  gone  down.    I  would  like  to  request  that  the  government  should 

ensure supply of raw hide and skin to the industry.  I would also request for setting 

up one leather-related Industrial Development Board.
