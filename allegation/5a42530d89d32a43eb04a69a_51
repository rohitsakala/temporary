 Massive infusion of public investment 

to  spur agricultural growth beyond 4% is required  to  double the  farmers' income.  

But out of the total allocation to the farm sector, only Rs.38,903 crore (12%) goes 

for agriculture investment, the rest goes to subsidies. The ill-effects on agriculture 

due  to  demonetization  is  not  at  all  compensated,  like  the  other  sectors  which 

portrays the neglect of this sector.    The unabated  incidents  of suicides  of  farmers 

are  due  to  the  indebtedness  of  farmers,  especially,  the  small  and  marginal  level 

farmers  who  own  less  than  2  acres  of  land.  The  system  of  Gramin  Banks 

effectively  operated  in  Bangladesh  can  also  be  tried  here  to  offset  the  rural 

indebtedness.    During  severe  droughts,  the  centre  should  come  forward  to  waive 

loans  offered  by  the  PSU  banks.    The  Government  is  neglecting  the  proposal  of 

Tamil Nadu Government for interlinking of peninsular rivers.  Another area where 

this  Government  has  to  focus  is  to  provide  and  transfer  modern  irrigation 

technologies  to  the  farming  community  and  to  bring  in  large  un-irrigated  land  to 

cultivation  to  increase  the  per  unit  productivity.    The  direction  of  agri  policy 

changes  of  this  Government  is  right  but  not  matched  by  ample  resources  and 

effective implementation resulting in partial gains to farmers.
