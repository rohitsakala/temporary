  This  is  an  important  Bill  and  is  being 

discussed in entirety in the standing committee.  The government is expecting that 

the report would come in the next session.  How did the government arrive at the 

conclusion that immediately this one section has to be amended.  But it seems that 

the  government  is  attempting  to  exempt  the  public  servants  from  its  provisions.  

Why  is the  government  in  a  hurry  to pass  this  bill  without discussion by  keeping 

the public servants and the members of Parliament out of its purview.
