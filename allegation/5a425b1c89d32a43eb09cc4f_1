  I would like to oppose the introduction 

of  the  Citizenship  (Amendment)  Bill,  2015.  The  facts  and  statements  of  the 

Minister are absolutely contradictory.  This kind of legislative exercise is adversely 

affecting  the  legislative  supremacy  of  Parliament  and  also  the  concept  of  the 

sanctum  sanctorum  of  democracy.    The  specific  objection  of  the  Bill  is  that 

through  this  Bill,  a  new  amendment  is  being  incorporated  in  Section  II(I)(e)(e) 

where the citizens of Indian origin have to be defined in the new Bill.  There is no 

Statement of Objects and Reasons for the proposed amendment.  There is also an 

Ordinance.    I  would  like  to  know  as  to  what  is  the  urgency  of  promulgating  the 

Ordinance.  Hon. Prime Minister had made a commitment to the persons of India 

origin.  If that being the case, then my question to the Government is that in order 

to  fulfill  the  commitment  why  this  provision  was  not  being  incorporated  in  2014 

Bill  and  in  the  Ordinance  which  was  promulgated  on  6th  January,  2015?    That 

means, the legislative exercise was being taken in a callous way.
