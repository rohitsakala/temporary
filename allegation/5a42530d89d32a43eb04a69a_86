 More than half of the population of the 

country  is  still  dependent  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihood  and  it  is  having  the 

direct  impact  on  the  rural  population.    After  the  Green  Revolution  though  the 

production  and  productivity  has  been  enhanced  like  anything,  unfortunately  the 

living condition of the farmers have not increased in proportion to the achievement 

made in respect of production and productivity.  The NDA Government has made 

a major announcement that by 2022 the income of the farmers would be doubled.  I 

would  like  to  know  from  the  hon.  Minister  as  to  what  is  the  clear  roadmap  for 

achieving the goal of doubling the income of the farmers in five years.  The main 

recommendation  of  the  Swaminathan  Committee  in  favour  of  the  farmers  is  that 

farmers would be provided 50 per profit over the input cost.  This Government is 

going  to  complete  three  years  in  office.    When  would  it  intend  to  fulfill  this 

promise as promised by it?  I would like to ask two questions to the hon. Minister.  

Is the nominal or the real income going to be doubled?  Which is the base year for 

assessing  the  income?    In  our  country,  there  is  no  proper  mechanism  to  measure 

the  income  of  farmers  in  the  country.    In  such  a  condition,  what  is  the  base  year 

and  how  is  it  going  to  be  doubled?    Regarding  fisheries,  it  is  a  big  sector.  

Unfortunately, it comes under the Ministry of Agriculture.  I would urge upon the 

Government to set up a separate Ministry for Fisheries because lakhs and lakhs of 

fishermen earn their livelihood in this sector.
