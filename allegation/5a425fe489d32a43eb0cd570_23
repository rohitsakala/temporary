  Our  Party  fully  supports  the  Bill 

introduced  by  the  hon.  Minister.    Around  2004-05  the  Chief  Minister  of  Uttar 

Pradesh had sent a list of 17 castes to the Central Government whose condition is 

worse than  dalits  for  inclusion  from  backwards to  dalit  list.   The  proposal  at  that 

time was not accepted by the UPA Government.  Later when the BSP Government 

came  to  power  there  that  government  took  back  the  said  proposal.    In  2012,  the 

Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh again send the proposal regarding the inclusion of 

17  castes  in  the  dalit  list.    The  Minister  in  his  reply  said  no  such  proposal  was 

pending  with  the  Registrar  General.    The  Chief  among  these  17  castes  are:  Bind 

Mallah,  Nishad,  Kashyap,  Dhimar,  Prajapati,  Rajbhar  etc.    That  proposal  may  be 

accepted.  We will also give our full support.  The people of Uttar Pradesh will not 

tolerate if the demands of their state, their policies and programmes are ignored.
