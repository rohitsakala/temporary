  The  Bill  seeks  to  include  certain  new 

castes, synonymous communities and modification of existing entries in the list of 

Scheduled Castes for the States of Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Kerala, Odisha and West 

Bengal.    The  Tamil  Nadu  government  has  been  repeatedly  writing  to  the  Union 

Minister of Tribal Affairs regarding the inclusion of the 'Narikoravan grouped with 

Kuruvikaran Community' on the list of Scheduled Tribes in Tamil Nadu.  Nearly, 

fifty  long  years  have  passed  ever  since  the  Lokur  Committee  --  appointed  by  the 

Central  Government  --  recommended  inclusion  of  the  Narikuravar  community  in 

the  list  of  Scheduled  Tribes.    However,  the  members  of  this  ancient  tribal 

community  in  Tamil  Nadu  have  been  struggling  to  get  the  ST  status  for  the  past 

four  decades.    The  Tamil  Nadu  Chief  Minister  had  also  urged  the  then  Prime 

Minister to include the Bagada people, a community of hilly Nilgiri region, in the 

list  of  Scheduled  Tribes  category.    Finally,  in  the  same  way,  the  fishermen 

community  in  Tamil  Nadu  should  also  be  recognized  as  tribal  and  accorded  the 

Schedule  Tribe  status  for  getting  their  rightful  share  in  education  and  job 

opportunities.
