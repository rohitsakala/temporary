  It  is  historical  fact  that  J&K  acceded  to 

India  in  unique  circumstances.    My  charge  against  this  Government  is  that  it  is 

creating trouble in J&K by ensuring that this Bill is implemented in the State and 

thereby  violating  Article  370.    The  J&K  State  Assembly  can  pass  their  own 

Statistics  (Amendment)  Bill.    National  Sample  Survey  office  engages  contractual 

staff  to  collect  data  through  field  surveys,  there  is  a  huge  variation  between  the 

survey  of  NSSO  and  that  of  the  State  Governments.    So,  I  would  like  to  ask  the 

hon.  Minister  whether  this  Ministry  will  hold  consultations  with  the  State 

Governments regarding survey procedures and methodologies.  As far as vacancies 

are  concerned,  861  posts  of  Statistical  Officers  under  Subordinate  Statistical 

Services  are  vacant.    It  is  because  of  the  difficult  nature  of  data  collection  work 

that many candidates are not inclined to join because of mismatch of language and 

staff.    So,  will  this  Government  recommend  incentives  to  provide  better 

conditions?  What safeguards is the Government taking to ensure that no one can 

break into these data and take away.
