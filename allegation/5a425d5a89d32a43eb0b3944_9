  I  rise  to  support  this  Bill  with  certain 

strong  reservations.    A  simple  question  which  I  would  like  to  make  before  this 

House  is  that  the  Hon.  Supreme  Court  has  always  alleged  against  others  that  the 

conflict of interest is there.  That we have seen in a lot of cases.  But in the case of 

counting the pensionable service of judges of High Court Judges and the Supreme 

Court, the same Supreme Court has heard the case and disposed of the matter.  Is it 

not a conflict of interest?  No direction should be given from the judiciary or from 

the  bench  that  this  should  be  counted  by  the  Government.    There  is  another 

interesting point to which I would like to draw the attention of the hon. Minister.  

The principal Act says that only the earned leave can be encashed.  But now we are 

making an amendment by which any leave at his credit can be encashed.  Again a 

Judge shall never hold any official post after his retirement.  Even if a Constitution 

Amendment is required for it, definitely it should come.  I also want to raise two 

points  regarding  the  NJAC  Bill.    My  point  is  that  the  Government  of  India  shall 

never give any comments for the reformation of the collegium.  But it is ready to 

give comments and response for the collegium reformation process.  This is totally 

unfair as far as parliamentary practice is concerned.  We have to bring the NJAC 

Bill back to the domain of Parliament and it should be implemented.
