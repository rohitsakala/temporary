  This  issue  does  not  confine  to  the 

territorial  boarder  only,  rather  it  is  of  cardinal  importance.    The  Government 

should talk about forming a grand federation of all three nations  - India, Pakistan 

and Bangladesh.  The Samajvadi Party has always been speaking about this issue 

in the  House.   This merger  would  augment the  trade  and  commerce  among these 

three countries.  This will also make this federation a formidable force in the field 

of  sports.    This  is  a  good  Bill    and  we  welcome  the  resolution  of  the  territorial 

disputes.    Dr.  Ram  Manohar  Lohia  had  made  efforts  in  this  direction  and  he  had 

held  talks  with  all  three  nations  in  this  regard.    Those  occupying  positions  of 

authority  do  not  favour  the  formation  of  the  federation  but  people  of  all  three 

nations want so.  This will also strengthen India.  Today, our jawans are sacrificing 

their life daily on our boarder, firing keeps going on and this will end all this and 

people will concentrate on progress and development.
