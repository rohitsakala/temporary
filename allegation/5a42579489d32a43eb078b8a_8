  I  would  like  to  seek  some  clarifications  from  the  hon. 

Minister.  The  hon.  Finance  Minister  has  put  forward  an  example  regarding 

demerger  of  BSNL.  I  want  to  know  from  the  hon.  Minister,  who  will  demerge 

companies  â€“  this  Government  or  the  private  companies?  So,  this  is  a  sign  of 

demerger of all our national assets, that is, PSUs. That will happen in our country. 

The  disinvestment  in  PSUs  will  leave  ample  scope  for  them  taking  up  these 

companies. The big companies are being established in the SEZs where they do not 

attract certain tax laws. There is a complete tax waiver. The revenue foregone each 

year is more than Rs. 5,85,000 crore, whereas Budget is of Rs. 19,00,000. There is 

a second amendment regarding reducing the job-days from 240 to 150 a year. This 

will directly affect the youth of this country. The joblessness and unemployment is 

increasing day by day in this country. In such a situation, why is the Government 

going to reduce the days of employment? This will harm the community which is 

living in the rural areas and the marginalized section of society.
