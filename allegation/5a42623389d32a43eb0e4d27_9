 I strongly oppose this Bill because this Bill legalizes the 

child labour in our country.  The provisions in section 3 A would allow children to 

work in so-called family enterprises and thus would legalize at least three-fourth of 

the  work  of  the  child,  which  is  presently  unlawful.    How  can  we  legalize  this 

system of child labour for the welfare of this corporate entity?  This Bill  legalizes 

child  labour.    We  strongly  oppose  the  implementation  of  this  Bill.    There  are  so 

many  loopholes  within  the  Bill  itself.    The  Bill  is  also  not  in  sync  with  the 

international  labour  law.    This  Bill  puts  a  new  category  of  person  called 

'adolescent'.    That  would  affect  the  unemployed  adults  in  the  country  because 

adolescent labour is cheaper.
