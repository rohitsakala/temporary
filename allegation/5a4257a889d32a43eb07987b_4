  This  is  an  anti  labour  Bill  and  slowly  this 

Government is interfering with the federal structure of this country.  As far framing 

of rules is concerned, the primacy has been given to the Central Government and 

the State Government is coming later on.  Central Government will make the rules 

on  the  industry.    But  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  chief  inspector  and 

inspectors,  the  responsibility  would  be  that  of  state.    Now  I  come  to  the  second 

point  regarding  the  increase  of  the  overtime  period.    It  will  adversely  affect  the 

health  condition  of  the  workers.    If  overtime  is  needed,  why  should  the 

Government not create scope for new employment?  The hon. Labour Minister has 

referred  to  the  International  Labour  Organization's  recommendations  but  let  him 

tell  me  whether  the  condition  in  any  factory  in  England,  America,  Canada  or 

Switzerland  similar  to  ours.  Therefore,  the  ILO's  recommendation  is  neither 

mandatory nor compulsory. It is dependent on the conditions of the country where 

it is implemented. If the Government continues with overtime, the unemployment 

problem  will  be  aggravated  and  new  employment  scope  will  not  be  there.  

Therefore, this is a Bill which I oppose.  Not a single trade union of West Bengal is 

in  favour  of  increasing  the  overtime  in  this  way.    I  was  telling  the  hon.  Minister 

that  nobody  wants  it.    Under  whose  pressure  the  Government  is  working?    I  say 

that  this  is  an  anti-labour  Bill  which  amounts  to  interference  with  the  federal 

structure of this country.
