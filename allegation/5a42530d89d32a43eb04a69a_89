  Hon.  Agriculture  Minister  has  said  that  the 

government would double the income of farmers by 2019 but I fail to understand 

as  to  how  the  government  is  going  to  do  so.    If  we  want  to  double  their  income 

then we will have to bring down the cost of production.  For this we will have to 

give them all basic facilities.  Pre-harvesting and post-harvesting loss is highest in 

our  country  and  for  checking  this  loss  also  we  will  have  to  give  them  basic 

facilities but we are not doing so.  Besides, we also need to give them all technical 

support.   There  has  been  unseasonal  rain  in  Maharashtra  during  the  last  2-3  days 

and  this  has  damaged  the  crops  of  farmers  there.    They  have  brought  tur  in  the 

market  but  it  is  getting  drenched  as  it  is  lying  open.    farmers  are  suffering  huge 

losses  repeatedly  due  to  various  reasons like natural calamity,  market price being 

less than the cost and government's intervention in the market.
