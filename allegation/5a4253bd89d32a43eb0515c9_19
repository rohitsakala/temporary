 Long back, in 1951 when the Patiala 

Government, for the first time, saw promulgation of Article 356.  At the outset, I 

would  categorically  put  it  on  record  very  clearly  that  all  these  are  regressive  and 

bad precedents that we are setting.  As a representative of an established regional 

party, I oppose this imposition of Article 356.  India is in a situation where both the 

BJP-led  NDA  and  the  Congress-led  UPA  seem  to  be  in  the  same  boat  and  both 

seem to be repeating each other.  I believe the Constitution is a piece of paper.  It is 

to  be  used  for the interest of the  people.  It is not  to be  misused  for our personal 

and  political  goals.    We  have  heard  about  cooperative  federalism  from  this 

Government.  We all hoped that a new chapter would begin.  So, this cooperative 

federalism  has  become  a  doubtful  slogan  now,  a  slogan  that  is  intended  for  use 

when  it  is  convenient.    What  the  BJP-led  NDA  government  has  done  till  now 

starting  from  Arunachal  Pradesh  to  Uttarakhand  is  not  only  anti-democratic  and 

anti-federalism  but  also  a  very  sad  thing  because  all  of  us  pin  a  lot  of  hope  on 

Narendra  Damodar  Das  Modi  Ji  and  his  Government.    A  floor  test  is  the  natural 

recourse if questions of stability of a Government are concerned.
