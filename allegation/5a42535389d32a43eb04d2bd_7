  As  per  the  data  released  by  the  Central 

Statistics  Office  CPI-based  inflation  gone  up  marginally  to  5.77%  in  June  from 

5.76%  a  month  ago  in  higher  food  prices.  India's  Wholesale  prices  are 

continuously  rising  in  the  recent  months. Prices  of  have  been  continuously  rising 

are pulses, vegetables, fibers, cereals, rice, sugar, wheat and oil seeds. Pulses and 

cereals  have  also  mostly  appeared  in  the  price  rise  list  in  the  last  decade  itself. 

Sharp rise in the vegetable prices is mainly in Tomato, Onion prices have caused 

huge burden on the family budget. The sharp increase in prices of wheat and rice 

will have an inflationary impact on essential commodities as open market prices of 

both  commodities  were  ruling  slightly  higher  than  the  above  the  poverty  line 

prices. Many essential commodities like petroleum products, pulses, fertilizers are 

either  imported  or  are  produced  with  imported  intermediate  good  s.  I  urge  the 

union  government  for  timely  market  intervention  to  take  measures  to  control  the 

prices.  I  would  also  like  to  suggest  the  union  government  to  provide  sufficient 

funds for creating necessary infrastructure in this regard.
