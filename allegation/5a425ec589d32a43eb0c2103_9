  There  are  a  large  number  of  Keralites  staying 

abroad.  They want to exchange their old 500 rupee and 1000 rupee notes.  Should 

they  go  to  Chennai  or  Mumbai  for  exchanging  them?    After  the  declaration  of 

demonetization,  how  many  time  they  have  changed  the  norms  and  rules?    When 

presenting  the  Budget  in  this  House,  the  hon.  Finance  Minister  said  that  we  can 

have  cash  transactions  for  Rs.  3  lakhs.    Today  we  hear  from  the  press  that  it  has 

been reduced to Rs. 2 lakhs.  Another problem is about the Non-Performing Assets 

of  the  banks.    There  are  about  six  to  seven  lakh  crores  worth  of  NPAs  in  this 

country.  Out of this, about five to six lakh crores is with the corporate houses of 

the country.  It is not with the farmers, students or with small traders.  When strong 

action is taken against the farmers, traders and students, what action they are taking 

against those people who have gone away from the country?  The third issue is the 

price rise.  I have got the details about the prices of essential commodities as per 

yesterday.  The price of Chenna dal, during the same day of 2015 was Rs. 55, but it 

is Rs. 84 now.  So, the prices are rising.  The next issue pertains to my State.  We 

are  facing  acute  drought.    The  Kerala  Government,  under  the  leadership  of  the 

Chief Minister, wanted to send a team to the Prime Minister.  That is being denied.  

The  State  of  Kerala  is  entitled  to  16.45  lakh  tonnes  of  food  grains  which  was 

allotted to Kerala in the last five years.  Our State is known for its efficient Public 

Distribution  System.    So,  Kerala  should  be  helped  to  overcome  the  drought 

situation.
