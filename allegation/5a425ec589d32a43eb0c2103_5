  Price  rise  is  going  on  unabatedly  leaving 

the budget of the common  man in crisis.  The prices of petrol, diesel and gas are 

going down in international market and in our country their rates are rising.  The 

train fares have also risen so much so that at some places they have become equal 

to  the  flight  ticket.    The  poor  travel  by  trains  across  the  country  the  most.  

Presently, they find it difficult to afford that also.  Crores of rupees were given in 

loans  to  the  big  corporate  houses  in  the  country  and  a  number  of  them  left  the 

country.    They  need  to  be  brought  back  and  punished.    On  one  hand,  the  Prime 

Minister has  given  the  slogan that  this is  the  Government of the  poor  and  for the 

poor, on the other hand the difficulty of the common poor has been rising day by 

day.  The population of muslims in this country is 14 per cent.  The whole country 

is  aware  of  the  worst  conditions  of  this  community.    The  Government  has 

earmarked  Rs.4195  crore  for  the  minorities  of  India  which  is  quite  a  meager 

amount in the Budget of year 2017-18.  Moreover, the full amount of the budget is 

also  not  spent.    In  the  budget,  Assam  has  not  been  given  any  special  care.    The 

biggest  issue  of  our  Assam  is  flood  and  erosion.    Brahmputra  needs  to  be 

controlled.  For this purpose, a separate fund should be earmarked.  Besides, it has 

been my frequent demand that the Dhubri-Phulwari Bridge should be completed.
