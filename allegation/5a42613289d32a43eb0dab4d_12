  Even  after  periodic  amendment  in 

the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act, 1950, the economic condition of 

these  communities  is  still  pitiable  as  on  date.    There  is  untouchability  prevailing 

even  today  after  68 years  of  Independence.   People of  these  communities  are  not 

allowed to enter into temples even today.  The benefit of the 'Ujala Yojana' is not 

accruing to them.  The Machhuara and Mali community, which is even below than 

those of the dalit communities, be brought under the Scheduled Castes category so 

that they could get its benefits.
