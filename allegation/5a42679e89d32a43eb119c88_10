  NABARD indeed can really 

do  something  for  the  nation.  Definitely  the  capital  should  be  increased  to 

RS.30,000  crore  and  we  support  it.    However,  Banks  are  not  lending  to  farmers.  

The policy of the Government is going in one direction and the banks which come 

under  the  Finance  Ministry  are  going  in  a  totally  different  directions.  For  non-

priority  sector  instead  of  giving  Rs.400  crore  they  gave  Rs.3,000  crore  and  for 

priority  sector  like  sheep,  farm,  land  development,  water  resources,  farm 

mechanization, they gave Rs. 5 crore when it should have been Rs.100 crore.  That 

is what the Finance Ministry has to look into.  At the same time, I am not here just 

to  complain.    I  am  also  here  to  thank  the  Ministry  for  what  it  has  done  for 

Telangana.   Telangana  is  investing  in  the  rural  sector.   They  have  given us loans 

for  irrigation  and  godowns.    In  Telangana,  we  are  getting  huge  returns  on  our 

investments.    Under  sheep  programme,  we  hope  to  get  something  like  Rs.25,000 

crore  as  return  in  three  years.    All  over  the  nation,  it  is  rural  to  urban  migration.  

But  in  Telangana,  particularly  in  two  districts,  there  is  urban  to  rural  migration, 

that  is  from  Hyderabad  to  Mehboobnagar  and  from  Hyderabad  to  Karimnagar.  

That  is  happening  because  of  the  irrigation  project  there.    We  request  for  a  little 

more funds and we hope the Minister considers it.  Rs. 5 crore was earmarked for 

my district under the District Credit Plan.  But the amount given was zero.
