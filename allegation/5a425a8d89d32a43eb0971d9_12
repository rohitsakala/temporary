 Hon. Minister said that six months have passed 

by  but  surprisingly  his  party  government  has  been  there  in  West  Bengal  for  last 

forty  years.    This  problem  has  also  been  there  since  the  year  1950  but  the  hon. 

Member is now saying that the State Government took six months time.  What did 

they do in 40 years?  Such a huge area was there with Bangladesh and the citizens 

living there did not have the basic amenities.
