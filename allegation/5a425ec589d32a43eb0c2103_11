  In  our  country,  72  per  cent  of 

population  is  dependent  on  agriculture.    In  the  event  of  monsoon  failure,  75  per 

cent  population  of  our  country  is  destined  to  face  acute  financial  crisis.    In  this 

regard I would like to ask the government whether it is taking any step to deal with 

such adverse condition.  In addition to that there have been a long pending demand 

of farmers regarding interest free loans.  I hope that arrangement should be made 

by the  government in this regard.  Besides, till date no draft has been brought in 

with regard to the GST which is a matter of great concern.  I would like to ask the 

Government about the provisions made in the GST for safeguarding the interests of 

backward states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha so that industry may be set up in 

the states like Bihar.  Since last ten years, the people and the Government of Bihar 

has been making demand with regard to granting of special status to Bihar. Due to 

geographical  locations  and  natural  reasons,  flood  and  drought  have  become  a 

perennial problem in Bihar. So, there is an urgent need of central assistance.  But 

the  Union  Government  is  resorting  to  political  discrimination    with  the  state 

government  and  the  interests  of  Bihar  are  being  neglected.    With  regard  to  the 

silting  problem  in  Ganga  river,  government  should  send  a  survey  team  for 

providing solution.  Similarly, to provide relief to the middle class, income upto 5 

lakh rupees should be exempted from income tax.
