  We  all  know 

that 

the  Mandal 

Commission  had  recommended  27 per  cent  reservation but  this  target  is  far  from 

achieved.  We are at only 12 per cent till now.  We had also demanded in this very 

House  that  this  Commission  should  be  given  constitutional  status.    It  is 

apprehended  that  the  Government  is  trying  to  exclude  certain  castes  and  include 

new  castes  in  the  list  of  OBCs.    If  the  Government  plans  to  include  some  other 

castes, the reservation quota should be increased proportionately from 27 per cent 

then  we  will  have  no  objection.    The  Government  of  India  should  not  enact  any 

law  without  taking  the  state  governments  into  confidence  as  ours  is  a  federal 

structure.  The report of caste-based census has not been published till now.  The 

OBCs of the country are keenly waiting for this report.  The backward classes of 

the country are facing injustice mainly because of the provision of creamy layer. I 

want  that  the  limit  of  creamy  layer  should  be  done  away  with  and  backlog  of 

recruitment should be cleared.
