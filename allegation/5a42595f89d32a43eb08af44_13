  I  would  like  to  welcome  The 

Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous 

Provisions  (Amendment)  Bill,  2016  brought  with  a  view  to  making  various 

financial Acts administratively vibrant and effective.  The NPA of about Rs.4 lakh 

crore reveals that big industrialists have robbed of the banks in connivance with the 

Government.  Some of the bank officers told me that the NPA was likely to go up 

to  Rs.20  lakh  crore.    A  number  of  laws  related  to  the  recovery  of  loans  existed 

even prior to this Bill but they resulted into the increase in the number of pending 

cases  but  not  in  the  recovery  amount  of  loans.    So,  a  success  in  this  direction  is 

very  difficult  to  achieve  unless  and  until  the  Government  does  not  plug  its 

loopholes and stricter laws are implemented properly.
