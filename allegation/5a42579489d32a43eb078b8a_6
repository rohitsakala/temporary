  Alongwith  generating  more  employment  in 

terms  of  number,  quality  of  employment  in  terms  of  salary  is  also  important. 

Private  sector,  petroleum,  banking,  insurance  companies  were  converted  into 

public  sector  to  guarantee  employment  and  help  the  downtrodden  people. 

Downtrodden people include all those who are poor irrespective of his caste, creed, 

region  and  religion.  But  all  those  public  sector  companies  are  in  losses.  This  has 

been only because of the policies. If we really wish to say that we want to bring the 

acche din, we should show the results.
