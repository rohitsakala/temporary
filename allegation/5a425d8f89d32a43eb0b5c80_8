  This  Bill  is  anti-people, 

anti-farmer  and  it  is  against  the  parents  of  lakhs  of  students.  Without  any 

consultation  and  without  any  consideration,  the  Government  of  India  decided  to 

merge the State of Bank of Travancore into the State Bank of India.  But, what is 

the result after the merger?  In the last so many months, approvals were very much 

delayed.    This  is  pushing  many  customers  to  private  banks  or  private  financers.  

This Bill is not only anti-people but also anti-employees and anti-officers.  Pension 

benefit was denied to the employees of five associate banks merged in 2017.  This 

year's promotion exercise has clearly indicated that there is no scope of promotion 

for  erstwhile  association  bank  employees.  This  has  pushed  many  associate  banks 

employees in a state of depression and dissatisfaction.  So, it is not going to  help 

the employees; it is not going to help the people, it is not going to help farmers.
