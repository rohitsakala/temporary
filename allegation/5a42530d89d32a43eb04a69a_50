 For a country of our size 

where  65  to  70%  of  the  population  of  135  crores  depend  on  agriculture  for 

livelihood, allocation  of 51,026  crores  is too  small  an  amount for the  Ministry  of 

Agriculture,  Cooperation,  Farmers  Welfare,  Agricultural  Research  and  Animal 

Husbandry,  Dairying  and  Fisheries.    It  is  happy  thing  to  note  that  the  issue  of 

welfare benefits are linked to Aadhaar (including the PDS), but in many villages, 

the bio metric (finger prints) is not functioning causing hardships to the illiterates. 

This  needs  modification  to  benefit  the  poor/illiterates.    Allocation  of  a  mere 

Rs.7,377  crores  to  the  PM  Krishi  Sinchayee  Yojana  for  increasing  the  irrigation 

facility is too small.  Micro irrigation has to be made popular and made available to 

all  the  farmers  both  to  save  water  and  to  irrigate  more  area.    Supply  of  quality 

seeds, harmless  pesticides, quality  fertilizers  coupled  with  irrigation  will  help  the 

farmers improve the output.  MSP should be constantly revised upwards matching 

the spiraling inflation.  There is a great misuse of funds under MGNREGA while 

using  for  digging  pits.    Food  subsidy  of  Rs.1,45,339  crores  and  the  subsidy  on 

fertilizer  (Rs.70,000  crore)  is  being  misused.    It  is  assessed  that  there  will  be  a 

saving  of  at  least  Rs.50,000  crores  per  annum,  if  the  disbursement  of  food  and 

fertilizer subsidy is monitored and streamline.  The growth of agriculture should be 

of at least 4% of the GDP as against the present 1 to 1.5%.  Cooperative farming 

may be encouraged for effective utilization of the limited resources like the plant 

and  machinery  and water.   Linking of village  mandies to  electronic platform  will 

help the farmers.
