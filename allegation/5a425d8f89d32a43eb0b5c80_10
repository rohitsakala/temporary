  In  the  wake  of  the  foreign 

exchange  crisis  in  the  year  1991,  the  Narasimham  Committee  had  recommended 

restructuring of banks but what is the rationality right now for the consolidation of 

banks?    Government  had  already  decided  to  merge  the  five  subsidiaries  and 

thereafter  they  have  brought  in  this  House  a  legislation  to  get  it  approved  by  the 

House.    So,  I  think,  this  is  nothing  but  to  seriously  erode  the  parliamentary 

authority of the country.  Government can only consolidate or merge depending on 

commercial and business reasons.  I would like to ask that what are the commercial 

perspectives or what are the business reasons which have propelled you to get the 

five  subsidiaries  to  be  consolidated?  What  sort  of  novelty  is  being  brought  about 

by  the  Government  through  the  consolidation  of  the  subsidiary  banks?    The 

corporate lobby of India has been using the SBI as a milching cow.  However, like 

a cow, the State Bank needs to be given proper sustenance.
