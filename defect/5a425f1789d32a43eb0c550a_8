 The Bills have many good 

features with few disappointments.  The main benefits are the uniformity of tax 

rate  structures,  removal  of  cascading  effect,  improved  competitiveness,  simple 

and  easy  administration,  better  controls  of  leakages,  increased  revenue,  free 

flow of goods across  the  nation.   It  also  increases  the profitability  because the 

capital locked up in inventories is freed up, the credit and the loan cost comes 

down.  There is a need to minimize the exemptions under the new GST regime.  

Due to exemptions, the very essence of the GST, the very principle of the GST 

gets  defeated  in  this  manner.    Section  171  provides  for  anti-profiteering  and 

many  people  raised  this  point.    It  is  unnecessary  to  include  it  because  it  gives 

way for harassment.  Then, the most important thing is this.  Suppose I am very 

complaint businessman, I buy from a supplier, he gives me a Bill, but he does 

not pay to the Government, do I get the input tax credit?  Why should I pay for a 

crime my supplier committed?  So, I think, this needs to be avoided.  Tax slabs 

under the new regime should be synced keeping the diversity of the country in 

mind.  A lot of money of Telangana is pending with the Government as there is 

dispute on it.  But, at least what they agree, let them pay us.
