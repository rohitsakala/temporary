  I  would  say  that  it  is  an  ambitious 

target  to  provide  housing  for  all  by  the  year  2022.    The  Ministry  under  the  able 

leadership  of hon. Minister of  Urban  Development  is doing  everything to  facilitate 

housing  for  all,  a  goal  set  by  our  Prime  Minister.    When  we  look  at  the  budget 

estimate, earlier provision under the Pradhan Mantri Avas Yojana was Rs.5075 crore 

and  Rs.3342  crore  was  to  given  to  the  States  as  grants.    But  in  the  last  week,  the 

grants have been increased to Rs.9000 crore.  I would congratulate the Government 

for increasing this budget estimate.  People from economically weaker sections are 

given  housing  loans  at  6.5  per  cent  subsidized  rate  of  interest  which  is  applicable 

only to the loan of Rs.6 lakh.  But we know that with Rs.6 lakh, we cannot buy an 

affordable  house  in  urban  India.    So,  I  would  sincerely  request  the  Government  to 

increase this  cap  to  at  least  Rs.10 lakh so that  economically  weaker section people 

could  buy  their  own  homes.    We  require  11  crore  houses  to  achieve  the  target  of 

housing for all by 2022.  Obviously, it needs private capital in a large manner.  The 

NITI  Ayog  has  expressed the  need  for  new  National  Urbanisation  Policy.   Finally, 

the  dream  of  providing  affordable  houses  will  get  impetus  when  the  fee  and  taxes 

will be drastically reduced.  Presently, 30 to 35 per cent of the housing cost consists 

of fees and taxes.  This is too high and this must be reduced, or as in case of power 

tariff we must adopt the principle of cross-subsidy.
