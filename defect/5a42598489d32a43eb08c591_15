    I  support  this  Bill.  In  1955,  we  had 

only eight regional NITs. In 1991, we have 17 NITs. After this, the era of respected 

Atal  Bihari  Vajpayee  ji  began  during  which  new  heights  were  achieved.  Various 

new  institutions  came  up  from  the  point  of  view  of  quality  education  in  India. 

Now,  revolutionary  decisions  are  being  taken  and  lots  of  efforts  are  being  made 

under the leadership of the present Prime  Minister to  make India the number one 

nation  in  the  world.  We  have  lots  of  shortcomings  in  our  system.  Our  engineers 

work  for  Rs. 8000  to  9000  per  month.  It  is  correct  that  we  maybe  a  little  behind 

China. Regarding research we have to make more efforts. There is a need to open 

more  centres  of  excellence  to  enable  our  meritorious  students  to  progress.  The 

women and the Dalits would not be able to reap the benefits of startup and standup 

schemes unless they are not provided better educational opportunities.  I hail from 

Ambala  constituency,  Haryana.    It  is  requested  that  these  type  of  institute  of 

national level should be set up in my Lok Sabha constituency.
