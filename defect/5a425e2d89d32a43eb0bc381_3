 The Central Government has taken a 

comprehensive  review  of  laws  and  the  legal  system  with  a  view  to  removing  the 

incoherent and redundant laws.  It is a good effort to unburden our statue books.  I 

would like to bring to the notice of the Government that this year this is the fourth 

time that such a repealing and an amending Bill has come to Parliament.  Do we 

have a proper historical documentation of these laws?  The way we are going about 

it seems like to unburden our statute books to make them slimmer we are getting 

rid  of  part  of  our  history.    The  Law  Commission  has  given  suggestion  that  1741 

laws  needs  to  be  changed,  why  are  we  dealing  in  piecemeal  is  a  suspicion  that 

would  strike.  I  suggest  that  a  Committee  comprising  of  lawyers  and  historians 

should look at these repealed laws or the laws to be repealed and ensure that this 

does not become a habit.  But let us keep a record of the laws that we are repealing.  

The old and draconian laws have harmed many people in this country.  There are 

certain Acts which needs to be re-looked at.  I would suggest that there should be a 

debate on the Uniform Civil Code. The moment you start differentiating, dividing 

society, you fall prey to the evil organisations like the ISIS.
