  This  is  the  last  opportunity  Member  of 

Parliament  for  participating  in  a  discussion  relating  to  taxation  legislation.  In 

future  GST  Council  would  be  taking  over  all  the  powers.  We  say  that  the 

parliament  is  supreme.  But,  we  ourselves  have  delegated  the  powers  of  the 

parliament to the GST Council. How can we justify it? Actually, this is against 

the  Constitution.  In  the  Schedule,  at  serial  no.  5,  two-wheelers  and  small  cars 

have  also  been  included.  These  are  used  by  ordinary  people.  The  above 

Schedule  gives  powers to  levy  compensation  cess on  any  supply  of  goods  and 

services. But, I am told that the GST Council had decided to levy compensation 

cess only on luxury cars, aerated drinks, and pan masala and tobacco products. 

These  wider  powers  to  levy  cess  on  any  commodity  or  services  have  to  be 

removed.  We  are  talking  of  'One  nation,  one  tax'.  But,  it  is  'One  Nation,  One 

Tax'  and  many  cesses.  The  Government  should  come  forward  and  rectify  the 

things. Then only, this law will become fruitful.
