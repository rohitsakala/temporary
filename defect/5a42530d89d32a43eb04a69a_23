  I  would  like  to  share  the  deep  concerns  of  the 

farmers  in  the  country  due  to  the  negligence  from  the  part  of  the  government 

continued in the Union Budget 2017-18. It failed to set forth a suitable package for 

the  ailing  agriculture  sector.  Most  importantly,  the  agriculture  sector  acts  as  a 

catalyst  for bolstering  growth  in  several other sector. Alarming  rise  in  the  farmer 

suicide  is  the  most  visible  sign  of  the  agrarian  crisis  in  our  country.  Due  to  the 

enhancing cost of cultivation and meager returns from the produces, the income of 

farmers  is  shrinking.  Moreover,  the  demonetization  programme  has  imposed  and 

additional  burden  on  the  farmers.  The  entire  supply  chain  of  the  agriculture 

produces  was  broken  off  due  to  the  Government-made  calamity.  The  farmers 

hoped that the Government might announce such a scheme of waiving off the loan 

in the last Union Budget. However, all of their dreams became a nightmare on first 

February 2017, as the Government failed to find a solution to farmers' distress. It is 

very difficult to measure the actual income of each farmer in the country and then 

how can the Government make such a promise that the income of the farmers will 

be  doubled  in  five  years.  But  the  interesting  thing  is  that  the  Government  is 

planning of reduce the number of farming community in the country.
