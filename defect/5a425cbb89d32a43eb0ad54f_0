    With  the  passage  of  time,  certain  provisions  of  the 

Supreme  Court  Judges  (Salaries  and  Conditions  of  Services)  Act,  1958  and  the 

High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Amendment Act, 1954.Act 

have  become  redundant  and  out-dated.  There  are  certain  provisions  in  these  two 

Acts which relate to the time when officers of the Indian Civil Service (ICS) were 

appointed and Judges.  Moreover, the provisions relating to determination of leave 

allowances of Judges also need to  be simplified.  At the same time, the Supreme 

Court,  while  disposing  of  a  Writ  Petition  has  given  a  direction  in  its  Judgment 

dated 31.03.2014 that a period of ten years be added to the service of those High 

Court Judges who have been appointed from the Bar, for the purpose of calculation 

of their pension.  A minimum 14 years of service is required to get a full pension.  

It may not be possible for those Judges because they used to establish their office 

for a very lengthy time to become senior lawyer or so on.  If at the age of 62, he 

retires  and  does  not  get  the  full  pension  benefit,  automatically  it  will  be 

discrimination.    It  is  also  observed  by  the  Court  that  when  persons  holding 

constitutional  office retire  from  service  making  discrimination in  fixation of  their 

pension is a breach of Article 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution.  Keeping in view 

the need  to  delete  certain  provisions  in  these  Acts  which  have  become  redundant 

and also to implement the judgment of the Supreme Court, it is proposed to amend 

these Acts.  This will bring clarity in the provisions of these two Acts and comply 

with the directions of the Supreme Court also.
