  The  explanation of  the hon. Minister 

in the Statement of Objects and Reasons is that the Jammu and Kashmir Collection 

of Statistics Act, 2010 does not cover the matters specified in the Union List and 

the Concurrent List.  So, I am seeking clarification from the hon. Minister that if 

the  Jammu  and  Kashmir  State  Assembly  is  having  the  authority  and  legislative 

competence to enact on these issues, then here it would definitely be the violation 

of  Article  370  of  the  Constitution.  This  is  a  very  important  matter.    Here,  the 

Government  proposes  to  amend  Section  9(1).    It  is  said  that  any  information 

furnished to the statistics officer or to any person or agencies authorized under this 

Act shall only be used for statistical purposes.  So, the Government wants to dilute 

it.  A new Clause has to be added that is 'the manner of use of information' under 

Sub-Section  (1)  of  'Section  9'.    There  also  the  power  is  vested  with  the  Central 

Government  to  make  the  rules  and  make  the  procedure  by  which  this  mandatory 

provision is being diluted.  It means, the transparency and accountability provision 

is  under  question.  By  amending  Section  33  of  the  existing  Act,  it  need  not  be 

published in the Official Gazette.  I would like to know from the hon. Minister as 

to what is the purpose of avoiding the Official Gazette publication.
