 This is a welcome Bill.  Our 

party supports it.  I think, most of us here support it.  I see one significant flaw in 

this Bill, that is, the sharp cut-off of Rs. 21,000.  If a person is actually having Rs. 

21,000 salary and an employer wants to punish him, he can give an increment of 

Rs. 500.  With the result, he goes outside the slab, and actually he will have a loss 

of  Rs.  20,000  to  his  annual  income.    I  think,  the  better  proposition  is  that  if  we 

have  slab  on  a  sliding  scale  declining  up  to  Rs.  42,000.    So,  at  a  salary  of  Rs. 

21,000 we can  have 8.33 percent; at Rs. 25,000 it can be seven percent and at Rs. 

42,000 it can be zero.  So, this will make everyone happy, and there is no loss to 

anyone.  The maximum limit that is prescribed is 20 percent.  Why can this not be 

enhanced to at least 40 percent?  A lot of injustice is being done to the contract and 

outsourcing  employees.      So,  I  would  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  look  into  this 

issue.
