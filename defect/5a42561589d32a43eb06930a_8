  It is unfortunate that as per the clauses in the 

existing  Act  which  dates  back  to  1882,  the  trust  money  has  to  be  invested  in 

promissory  notes,  debentures,  stock  and  other  securities  of  the  United  Kingdom. 

This  Bill  is  deleting  all  these  clauses.    I  request  the  Government  to  come  with  a 

fresh Act for the Indian Trusts Act.
