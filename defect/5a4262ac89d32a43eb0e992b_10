  This  Bill  was  much  required. 

The objective of this Bill is to reduce transportation cost as also promote tourism.  

We have two three apprehensions about this Bill with regard to our State Punjab.  

The  hon.  Minister  should  take  note  of  the  same.    The  irrigation  projects  which 

would come up under the National Waterways should be under the control of the 

concerned  State  itself.    The  Chenab,  Jhelum  and  Ravi  rivers  should  also  be 

included under the National Waterways.  The Mineral Department creates hurdles 

in  desilting  of  Sutlej  and  Beas  rivers  and  thereby  causing  floods  by  these  rivers.  

Therefore,  this  aspect  should  also  be  taken  into  consideration.    The  Ganga  canal 

should also be included under the National Waterways.  The Sarhind canal should 

also be revived because this canal has a vast potential of becoming a waterway.
