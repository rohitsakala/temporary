  The  budget  should  reflect 

the aspirations  of  the  village, the  poor, the  dalit, the exploited,  the backward, the 

neglected, the farmers and the youth.  It is our demand that special package and a 

special status should be given to the state of Bihar.  The Mandal Commission came 

into force in the year 1993.  But this was implemented in the Central universities in 

2007  but  post  of  teachers  are  not  being  filled  accordingly.    The  allocation  for 

PMGSY and MNREGA should be increased.  Tourism sector should also be given 

due  importance  in  Bihar.    An  AIIMS  should  be  set  up  in  Banka.    Anga  and 

Bhojpuri languages should be included in the VIIIth Schedule of the constitution.
