 The Government targets the whole lot 

of  labour  laws.    It  is  not  for  the  benefit  of  the  labourers,  the  workers,  and  the 

employees of our country, but for the benefit of corporate and for the benefit of big 

business houses of our country.  In Section 64, it is said that the expression ‘fifty 

hours’ should be changed to ‘one hundred hours’.  In the Statement of Objects and 

Reasons, it  has been stated, “to  facilitate  ease of doing  business  so as to  enhance 

employment opportunities”. Here, the two points are contradictory.  In our country, 

we are seeing that in eight major employment generation sectors, only 1.30 lakh to 

1.35  lakh  people  are  being  engaged  yearly.    But  every  year  more  than  one  crore 

unemployed youths are entering into the job market. So, if this Government really 

wants  to  give  jobs  to  unemployed  youths  of  our  country,  this  overtime  period 

should not have been increased.  I find here that spread overtime is increased to 12 

hours.  Earlier, it was 10 hours and 30 minutes.  Finally, I would like to say that 

majority  of  the productive  workforce  will  be  out  of  the coverage of the  Factories 

Act.  So, I strongly oppose the amendment and I want our hon. Labour Minister to 

look into this and request that this Bill be withdrawn.
