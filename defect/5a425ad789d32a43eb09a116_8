  I  welcome  this  Bill.  The  Bill,  in  short,  has 

three main areas. One is the definition of ‘benami transactions’, the second one is 

setting  up  of  Appellate  Tribunal  and  other  adjudicating  authorities  and  the  third 

one  deals  with  penal  provisions.  In  spite  of  having  so  many  legislations,  people 

with malign intention are finding loopholes and elbowroom in circumventing laws 

through unfair practices. Under income declaration scheme, if a person declares his 

benami  properties,  will  he  get  immunity  under  this  Bill?  It  is  a  big  question.  I 

request  the  hon.  Minister  to  bring  an  official  amendment  in  genuine  transactions 

even in case of non-HUF families where name of elder member of the family, who 

has partly or fully paid for the property, does not occur as joint owner.
