  At the outset, let me just say that I and my party 

support  the  Bill.    However,  the  reason  I  am  speaking  on  this  particular  Bill  is  to 

actually  give  a  sense  of  what  Sikkim  was  before  1975.    It  was  in  1975  that  a 

historical referendum was undertaken in Sikkim through the Government of India 

because  Sikkim  was  a  protectorate  of  India.    However,  through  the  36th 

Constitution Amendment, Sikkim became the 22nd State of India.  There has been 

reservation  in  Sikkim  Assembly  and  there  have  been  further  reservations  as 

Scheduled Tribes as well.  But the Scheduled Tribes who were reserved earlier is 

not under Article 332 of the Constitution of India.  It is only two communities - the 

Limbu community and the Tamang community - which got the reservation in 2003 

through a Constitution Amendment.  Today, the State Government is pressed with 

the  idea  that  we  would  have  to  give  the  same  kind  of  reservation  to  11  other 

communities  -  Dewan,  Gurung,  Mangar, Khambu  Rai,  Sunuwar,  Bahun,  Chhetri, 

Sanyasi,  Jogi  and  two  others  -  thereby  making  the  entire  Sikkim  subjects,  all 

Sikkim  subjects,  as  tribals  in  the  State  of  Sikkim.    This  is  the  demand  which  we 

have forwarded to the Central Government, and we would like to see the light of 

the day in this particular demand.
