 The salaries of High Court and Supreme Court Judges 

were initially fixed in Schedule-II of the Constitution and could only be altered by 

a  constitutional  amendment.    With  the  passage  of  time,  certain  provisions  in  the 

Acts have become a spent-force and out-dated.  In a Writ Petition filed in the hon. 

Supreme  Court,  a  prayer  was  made  for  addition  of  ten  years  of  practice  as  an 

advocate to the service as a Judge of the High Court for the purpose of computing 

pension  on  par  and  similar  with  ten  years  of  service  added  to  the  service  of  the 

Supreme  Court Judges.   The  petitioners said that  while  Part-I and  Part-III  Judges 

hold  equivalent  posts,  they  are  not  similarly  situated  with  regard  to  pension  and 

retirement  benefits  which  are  a  breach  of  Articles  14  and  21  of  the  Constitution.  

For  this  reason,  the  members  of  the  Subordinate  Judiciary  get  more  pension  than 

the Judges elected from the Bar on retirement.  According to the Supreme Court's 

view, if the service of a judicial officer is counted for fixation of pension, there is 

'no valid reason' as to why the experience at Bar cannot be treated as equivalent for 

the same purpose.(Speech unfinished)
