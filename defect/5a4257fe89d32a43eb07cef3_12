  India leads the world in the number of 

pending  cases.    More  than  2  crore,  6  lakh  and  57  thousand  and  841  cases  are 

pending  out  of  which  more  than  40  lakh  cases  are  commercial  in  nature.    The 

previous  Government  set  up  Gram  Nayalyas.    Do  they  exist  now?    The  court 

should  monitor  cases  above  Rs.  1  crore.    However,  how  many  people  in  our 

country have Rs.1 crore.  I would request the Hon. Minister to reduce this amount 

to  Rs.  25  lakh  so  that  medium  level  shopkeepers  can  also  get  justice  from  such 

courts.    Are  you  going  to  set  up  a  new  parallel  system  to  the  district  courts  and 

appoint Judges with commercial background to monitor commercial activities.  If a 

person is appointed Judge in the commercial court as per rules roster changes after 

every six months.  If a Judge is appointed in a commercial it will take him atleast 

six months or one year to understand the commercial activities and by that time he 

would be transferred.  Why can we not appoint Judges as we appoint IAS and IPS.  

Poor  person  can  never  get  justice  in  the  High  Courts  and  the  Supreme  Court 

because he does not have lakhs and crores to pay the lawyers.
