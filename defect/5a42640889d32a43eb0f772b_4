 Ever since the formation of 

the NCBC in 1992, this demand has been there.  I would like to say that it needs to 

be clarified by the Cabinet Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment regarding 

the right of the State to determine the OBC status of a particular community or a 

class.    It  is  because  if  you  consider  the  State  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  there  are  139 

castes  which  come  under  the  Backward  list  of  the  States,  but  which  are  not 

completely recognized by the Central Government itself under the OBC list.  When 

the State Government requests the Central Government to help in this great cause 

of providing education to the Backward Classes, out of these Rs.2,000 crore, they 

provided only Rs.34 crore which is very meager.  27 per cent reservation has been 

recommended  for  the  OBCs  by  the  Mandal  Commission.    But  even  today,  the 

Central Government organizations accommodate only 12 per cent in various states.  

So,  there  has  been  a  lot  of  injustice  in  fulfilling  that  27  per  cent  which  has  been 

recommended by the Mandal Commission.  There are a lot of other hindrances in 

achieving  27  per  cent  reservation.  Therefore,  the  ceiling  limit  of  creamy  layer 

should  be  increased.   More  and  more  fund  should be granted to  the  NCBC.    The 

Centre  has  to  look  into  further  classification  of  OBCs  into  different  categories.  

The Centre needs to support the States, which are coming up with good schemes, 

to help the BCs also.
