  This  Bill  had  been  brought  earlier  by  the 

UPA  Government.  But  because  it lapsed, it  has to  be  reintroduced today  both  in 

Rajya  Sabha  and  in  Lok  Sabha.    Today  the  question  arises  as  to  why  are  we 

supporting this Bill.  The earlier 1988 Act had a blanket prohibition that this is a 

'benami  transaction'  defined  hereunder,  and  this  cannot  be  allowed,  and  this  is 

banned.   But there  was no  detailed  legislation. We  did not  know  who is going  to 

investigate?  Who is going to go after a benami transaction?  So, I appreciate the 

move  of  the  Government.   Now, we  have  proper  authorities, proper investigating 

officers  in  initiating  investigations,  the  approving  authority,  an  administrator  and 

the adjudicating authority.  Few issues that I feel have created some confusion in 

my mind is that in Section 53(1) which says that any person who is in violation of 

provisions  of  this  law,  shall  be  prosecuted  with  rigorous  punishment,  etc.    When 

you say any persons, the question that arises is who is that person.  I hope the hon. 

Finance Minister would elaborate on that.  Secondly, and most significantly, where 

this  Government  is  consistently  talked  about  cooperative  federalism,  I  do  not 

somehow understand why one the property is confiscated, why should it vest in the 

Central  Government  and  not  in  the  respective  State  Governments  where  those 

properties are today situated?
