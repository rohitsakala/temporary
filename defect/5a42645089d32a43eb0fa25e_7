  This  Bill  gives  an 

opportunity  for  untrained  teachers  to  have  training  before  the  31st  March,  2019.  

According  to  one  estimate,  out  of  66  lakh  teachers, 11  lakh  teachers  do  not  have 

proper  training.    Among  poor  people  we  have  a  number  of  people  who  have 

excellent intelligence.  In the united Andhra Pradesh, Fees Reimbursement Scheme 

for all economically weak students was introduced with the result the children are 

able  to  study  engineering,  medicine,  MCA  and  MBA.    Intelligence  is  a  national 

asset.  We have many living examples of people from humble background reaching 

the peak.  So, we have to encourage the intelligent students among poor people and 

give them best education so that they can be useful for the welfare of the country.
