  In view of the impending elections in the State 

of West Bengal in the  month of May, 2016 amendments to the Representation of 

the People Act, 1950 and Delimitation Act, 2002 are necessary because the areas 

between  our  country  and  Bangladesh  have  been  exchanged.    Also,  a  situation 

between  the  States  of  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Telangana  arises  because  seven 

Mandals  of  Telangana  State  were  transferred  to  the  State  of  Andhra  Pradesh 

through an Ordinance.  Areas with 90 per cent of voters in the Assembly segment 

of Bhadrachalam in the State of Telangana were transferred to the State of Andhra 

Pradesh.    Now,  in  this  country,  those  people  are  neither  represented  in  Andhra 

Pradesh nor in Telangana.  This is a very unfortunate situation.  I would request the 

Government  to  bring  a  Bill  as  early  as  possible  to  clarify  the  situation.    I  would 

request  the  hon.  Law  Minister  to  bring  a  comprehensive  Bill  with  regard  to  this 

exchange of villages in both the States.
