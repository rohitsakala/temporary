  MSMEs  are  the  largest  employment 

provider.    This  sector  is  not  yet  ready  to  adapt  the  GST  and  has  fear  that  GST 

could  add  to  their  woes.  The  Government  has  a  duty  and  responsibility  to  allay 

their fears. Credit flow towards the MSME sector has been thinning due to a surge 

in  Non-Performing  Assets  (NPA)  in  banks.    GST  regime  will  not  differentiate 

between luxury goods and normal goods. This will  make it hard for the SMEs to 

compete against large enterprises.  In essence, the GST's effect on the entire Indian 

economy  will  have  to  be  examined  in  entirely  to  reach  a  widely  accepted 

conclusion.    Until  then,  manufacturing  states  like  Tamil  Nadu  should  be 

sufficiently compensated and their loss due to implementing GST should be repaid 

then  and  there.  As  a  part  of  the  roadmap  for  the  implementation  of  GST,  the 

Central Sales Tax rate was reduced from four per cent to two per cent with effect 

from  2008.  The  Government  of  India  agreed  to  implement  various  non-revenue 

measures  and  direct  release  of  funds  to  compensate  the  states  for  their  revenue 

losses.  The  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  has  been  submitting  its  compensation 

claims  regularly  but  has  not  received  the  promised  compensation  in  full.  We  are 

grateful that after  a long delay  of  nearly  four  years, a  sum  of  Rs.2,000  crore  was 

finally released and Rs.2238.35 crore during 2015-16.  However, even after these 

releases a sum of Rs.6,352.21 crore is yet to be reimbursed by the Government of 

India.    I  request  that  the  entire  outstanding  compensation  claims  of  Tamil  Nadu 

should be sanctioned and released at the earliest.
