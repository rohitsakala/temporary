 This Bill is related to the State Bank of India. 

It  merges  five  banks  of  the  states  in  SBI.    This  merger  of  five  banks  is 

unprecedented across the world in itself.  This merger is a reorganization to check 

duplication of resources.  As per a data of 2016, in terms of the home loan, car loan 

and personal loan  provided by SBI and its five subsidiary banks, the lowest rates 

were offered by the SBI.  As such, in the wake of this merger the consumer of this 

country is going to have the maximum benefit as it will increase the possibility of 

loan at lower interest from a major bank.  The State to which I belong has a major 

part  with  tribal  and  naxalite  affected  areas.    Even  now,  there  are  certain  such 

villages  over  there  where  people  have  to  commute  30-40  kilometers  to  avail  the 

banking facilities.  Welcoming this Bill, I would like to submit that new branches 

of  the  SBI  may  certainly  be  got  opened  in  all  those  rural  areas  from  where  the 

people have to cover a lot of distance for banking services.
