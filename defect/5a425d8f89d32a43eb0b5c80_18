  If  an  enactment  is  made  on  the 

basis  of  this  Bill,  I  think,  some  positive  changes  can  be  made.    Coming  to  the 

positive side, global markets will recognize India's strength in the banking sector.  

Efficiency of the banks can also be upgraded.  The negative part of it is that it will 

reduce the accessibility of the common man to the banking system in our country, 

merger  will  result in closing of  certain  ATMs  in our  country.   It  may  block  even 

further recruitment in the banking system.  It will also worsen the unemployment 

situation.  It will have negative impact on financial inclusion and to extending the 

banking  sector  in  the  uncovered  areas  and  villages.    There  is  some  kind  of  an 

execution risk also which may create a lot of confusion in the banking sector.
