  Bangladesh  was  created  in  the  year 

1971. After the constitution of Bangladesh, an agreement was signed between the 

Government  of  India  and  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  on  demarcation  of  land 

boundary under the leadership of Smt. Indira Gandhi and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 

thereafter  efforts  were  made  by  Dr.  Manmohan  Singh  in  regard  to  resolution  of 

border  issues  during  the  year  2013,  however,  the  de  facto  efforts  to  resolve  the 

dispute are being made today. We had to make a lot of sacrifices in the creation of 

Bangladesh. The Hon'ble Minister has tried to address the small pending issues in 

the  bill  after  deliberations  with  the  State  Governments  aligning  the  Bangladesh 

border.  However,  there  should  be  a  provision  by  which  the  citizens  of  India  and 

Bangladesh who were residing in territories in adverse possession should be able to 

return and resettle in their respective countries.
