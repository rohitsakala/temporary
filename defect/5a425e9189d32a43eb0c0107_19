  When  we  are  at  the  threshold  of  becoming  a 

developed  nation  and  when  we  are  putting  our  effort  to  adopt  the  process  of 

Urbanization    wholly,  the  allocation  of  mere  Rs.  5411  crore  on  this  head  is  not 

adequate to address the cause. Hence it is necessary to enhance the Budget allocation 

in  this  regard.  The  Government  to  take  initiative  to  complete  all  the  infrastructure 

based  projects  under  JNNURM  for  Integrated  Development  of  Small  and  Medium 

Towns.  The  banks  are  not  providing  small  scale  Housing  loans  to  the  weaker  and 

marginalized section of the country. Hence, the Government look into the matter to 

achieve  its  target.  Provision  of  employment  is  one  of  the  important  agenda  of 

Government but allocation in this regard is being reduced. The Government should 

treat the millions of urban unemployed people as resources of our country and they 

should  not  be  neglected  at  any  cost.  Implementation  of  the  Municipal  Cadre  was 

mandatory  State  level  reform  under  structural  reforms  of  JNNURM-I.  However, 

financial  burden  for  grounding  the  municipal  cadre  is  very  high  for  my  State, 

Odisha. The Ministry of Urban Development is requested to provide advance grants 

towards  transitional  cost  of  my  State's  initiative  to  put  the  municipal  cadre.  The 

financial  support  from  the  Centre  would  immensely  help  in  improving  the  urban 

areas in the country. Bhubaneswar, the capital of my State, Odisha has been chosen 

to be made as a smart city. In order to make a smart city it is necessary to clear the 

slum  developed  in  different  parts  of  the  city  and  initiative  should  be  taken  to 

rehabilitate the slum dwellers with all the facilities. In this regard, adequate financial 

assistance is required for the purpose.
