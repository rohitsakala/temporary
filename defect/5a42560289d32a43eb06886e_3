 Union Government has decided that 

an  amount  of  Rs. 4.50  per quintal of  sugarcane  will  be directly  transferred to  the 

bank accounts of the farmers. This is a historic decision. I support this Sugar Cess 

(Amendment) Bill. The current ceiling is Rs. 25 per quintal. Government intends to 

increase it to Rs. 200. There is a jump of 6,000 percent in terms of payments to the 

farmers.  This  is  the  bigger  issue.  The  Government  has  asked  the  mill  owners  to 

export at least four million tonnes of sugar in one year and if they did not export 

action  would  be  taken.  The  export  market  is  already  full  with  a  lot  of  sugar. 

Foreign  countries  provide  incentives  to  sugar  industry  and  Indian  industry  has  to 

compete  with  them  at  its  own.  Government  should  provide  assistance  to  this 

industry. Sugar industry also provides employment to 2.6 lakh people directly and 

it  is  the  second  largest  agro-economic  activity  in  the  whole  country.  Hence  this 

needs a holistic solution and addressing of the structural issue.
