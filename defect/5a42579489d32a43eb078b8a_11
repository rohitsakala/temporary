  This  Bill 

is  providing  certain 

exemptions, concessions and also expansion of the Customs Tariff Act. If we are 

providing some concessions and exemptions to some other agency or to somebody, 

it  should  be  dealt  with  in  detail.  This  Bill  is  being  brought  to  the  House  very 

urgently.  We  are  well  aware  that  the  Finance  Act,  2016  was  passed  just  three 

months back. About the first amendment, I would only seek a clarification from the 

hon. Minister. In his opening remarks, the hon. Finance Minister said that after the 

Videsh  Sanchar  Nigam  Limited  has  been  privatized,  it  has  gone  to  the  Tata 

Company. Hence, we are not able to get back the land or we have to pay the capital 

tax for getting back the land. A company which has already ceased to be a public 

company will be a demerger entity and the benefit will be given to that company. 

That  means,  the  benefit  is  definitely  not  coming  to  the  Government.  I,  therefore, 

would  like  to  seek  this  clarification  from  the  Government  as  to  how  the 

Government will get the land back. Coming to the second  amendment, I strongly 

oppose  it.  It  totally  oppose  the  provision  of  Section  18JJAA  which  says  that  the 

apparel industry need not provide employment of 240 days but need to provide 150 

days  of  work  and  will  be  entitled  to  the  benefits  and  concessions  coming  under 

Section  80JJAA.  So,  limiting  the  number  of  working  days  from  240  days  to  150 

days cannot be accepted. The third amendment is regarding the Customs Duty. If it 

is  being  enhanced  to  40  per  cent,  what  is  the  benefit  available  to  the  exporting 

countries?
