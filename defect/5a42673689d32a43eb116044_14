    This  is  a  much  awaited 

legislation  and  i  welcome  this.    Relevancy  of  standardization  of  our  products  in 

Indian situation is very much required. Our dream is to make India an international 

destination  of  quality  products.  This  is  an  era  of  competition  and  in  this  era  of 

competition, we  must ensure that our products are having international standards.  

We must ensure that the imported materials are also kept useful standard according 

to our norms and conditions. The most important thing which I am noticing in this 

legislation is to make all the stakeholders such as manufacturers, service providers, 

standard  deciding  authorities,  consumers  and  even  consumer  organization 

accountable.    There  is  a  paradoxical  situation  prevailing  here.  Consumers  are 

misled  with  false  claims  and advertisement and  even  with  manufacturing defects.  

We  know  that  there  are  a  lot  of  controversies  like  Volkswagen  carbon  emission 

controversy, Maggi controversy, Cadbury, Coke and Pepsi and all kind of things. 

Even  medical  devices,  including  medical  electronic  devices  are  also  sub-standard 

materials  sold  out  in  Indian  market.  It  is  pertaining  to  the  health  of  Indians.  

Manufacturers  and  sellers  are  all  adopting  some  kind  of  easy  money  making 

process. We have to make an end to that also.
