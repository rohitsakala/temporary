  The  implication  on  the  impact  of  the 

Bill  is  to  be  addressed  by  the  Government  and  for  which  I  am  putting  my 

suggestions.    If  a  driving  license  is  seized  by  the  police  authorities,  a  temporary 

receipt  will  be  given  but  the  concerned  person  will  not  be  allowed  to  use  that 

temporary acknowledge receipt for driving.  That is the denial of the Fundamental 

Right of a particular citizen of our country.  Hence, you should specify the time by 

which the decision should be taken.  The Central Government should provide the 

infrastructure facilities to the State Government for having Centralized Registering 

Authority.    More  Central  funds  should  be  provided  to  the  State  Governments  for 

this  purpose.    The  provisions  regarding  the  manufacturing  defects  in  the  vehicle 

and the scientific requirement of a quality helmet required to be looked into.
