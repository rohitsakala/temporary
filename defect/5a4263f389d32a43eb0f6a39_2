 The first point is that the Bill proposes to target 

traffic offenders with stringent penalties.  The second point is about creation of the 

Motor  Vehicle  Accident  Fund.    Under  the  Act,  the  Fund  is  called  the  Solatium 

Fund  to  pay  compensation  to  hit  and  run  victims.    But  under  the  Bill,  the 

Government  is  also  creating  one  more  Fund  called  the  Motor  Vehicle  Accident 

Fund.  So, the point is: what is the necessary for a second Fund when first fund is 

already there?  One other point that I would like to make is regarding the definition 

of 'road rage' but there is no definition for this in the Bill.  It would be good to have 

a  definition  for it.   My  final point is that  there are  thousands  of  buses, which  are 

illegally registered with fake addresses and they are given All-India Permit/Tourist 

Permit, which is not allowed for sleeper coaches.  I would request the Government 

to please investigate this and cancel the registration and certificates of these illegal 

vehicles as it is causing huge safety-related issues for the citizens at large.
