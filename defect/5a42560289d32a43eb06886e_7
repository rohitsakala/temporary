 

  Honourable  members  have 

reservation with regard to one or two issues. The hike in sugar cess from Rs. 25 to 

Rs.  200  per  quintal  does  not  serve  the  interest  of  farmers  .    I  request  the 

Honourable Minister to frame a policy and consider it accordingly.  I also request 

the government to suggest measures  for reviving the closed sugar mills especially 

in Bihar.   

 

THE  MINISTER  OF  CONSUMER  AFFAIRS,  FOOD  AND  PUBLIC
