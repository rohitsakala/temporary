  I  support  the  Budget  2016-17  for 

Housing  and  Urban  Poverty  Alleviation.    The  provision  is  for  release  of  Central 

Assistance  to  States towards housing projects  under  Pradhan Mantri  Awas  Yojana.  

We  have  been  hearing  from  ages  about  providing  housing  for  all  the  poor,  but  till 

date  this  target  has  not  been  achieved  by  the  previous  Governments.   I  request  the 

Government to make a permanent policy for land acquisition for housing projects.  It 

has also been noticed that the houses given by Government to the slum dwellers are 

still not possessed by the owners but they are either rented out or sold out after they 

are  given  the  houses.  I  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  look  into  such  cases  and  form 

some  stringent  rules  and  regulations  for  the  people  who  are  the  owners  of  houses 

provided by Government.  Nandurbar which is a tribal area should also be included 

amongst the housing scheme for which the funds have been allocated to the State of 

Maharashtra recently.  Since the tribal people are migrating to the city of Nandurbar 

in  search  of  jobs,  such  cities  that  are  adjoining  the  tribal  areas  should  be  given 

priority under this PMAY.
