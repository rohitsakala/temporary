  I am not raising questions on the legislative competence.  The notification for 

demonetisation  should  not  have  been  given  by  the  Government.    Rather,  it  should 

have  been  given  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India.    The  notification  should  have  been 

issued under  sub-Section  (1) of  Section 34  and  sub-Section (1)  of  Section 26 of  the 

Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.
