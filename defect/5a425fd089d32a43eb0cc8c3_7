 The real estate sector lays an important role in 

our Indian economy in terms of GDP.  It is also the second largest employer in our 

country  after  agriculture.  The  Bill  aims  to  regulate  the  real  estate  sector  by 

bringing  in  transparency,  accountability,  credibility  and  by  protecting  the 

consumers' interest.  The frequent complaint against the developers is the delay in 

execution  of  the  projects.    The  delay  in  approvals  is  the  single  biggest  factor 

behind the delay in execution.  However, the proposed Regulatory has no powers 

to ensure that regulatory and statutory approvals are given on time.  The authorities 

under the State laws having power to grant permits and sanctions for construction 

should also be brought within the control of the provisions of this Act so that any 

abnormal  delays  or  violations  committed  by  the  permitting  authorities  shall  be 

subject to appropriate action under this Act.  The requirement of deposit of 70 per 

cent  of  sale  proceeds  into  the  escrow  Bank  account  of  the  project  will  not  yield 

good results.  Hence, such requirement of deposit can be brought down to fifty per 

cent.  All ongoing and pending projects till date be exempted from the purview of 

this  Act.    In  the  interest  of  the  real  estate  sector  this  Act  should  be  implemented 

with effect from 1-4-2016.
