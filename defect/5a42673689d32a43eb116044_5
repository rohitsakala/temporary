  If  India  has  to  become  a  global  economic 

superpower, standards are an extremely important subject, and we cannot become a 

global economic superpower without passing such type of Bills.  The Bill proposes 

to widen the scope and bring in more products and services under standards regime 

and end the Inspector Raj.  Mandatory certification regime of an article, process or 

service  is  necessary  from  the  point  of  view  of  health,  safety,  environment, 

prevention  of  deceptive  practices,  security  etc.    The  other  positive  aspect  of  this 

Bill  is  that  it  allows  foreign  and  Indian  entities  other  than  the  Bureau  to  be 

recognized as the standardizing authority.  I suggest that BIS should be allowed to 

primarily  focus  only  on  certification  and  standardization.    The  terms  used  in  the 

Bill  may  also  be  defined  as  accepted  internationally.    Clause  7  of  the  Bill  deals 

with  the  appointment  of  Director  General.    BIS  is  a  fully  autonomous  body  not 

financed  by  the  Central  Government.    Clause  7(3)  indicates  that  the  Central 

Government will appoint Director General, which is not advisable.  BIS should be 

headed  by  a  scientist.    How  can  BIS  accredit  other  similar  bodies?    the  Bill  is  a 

consumer-friendly and helps in stopping unfair and unscrupulous trade practices.  I 

have  seen  in  the  country  where  various  manufacturers  are  making  certain  claims 

about products and services that do not hold true.  The Bill proposes to give more 

autonomy to the BIS.  It is a welcome step.  You  are only talking about Technical 

Committee which is non-existent in the present set up of BIS. So, I would request 

the hon. Minister to clarify this.  With the proposed Bill, I am confident that India 

will catch-up with the world standards and fulfill the hon. Prime Minister's slogan 

of 'Zero Defect, Zero Effect.'
