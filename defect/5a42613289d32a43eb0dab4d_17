 Every year some castes are included in the list 

of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  However, are the facilities being given 

to them sufficient and whether the objective of these facilities have been fulfilled?  

Today,  even  after  70  years,  posts  falling  under  high  category  vacancies  are  kept 

vacant by stating that candidates were found 'not efficient'.  If these governments 

have  not  been  able  to  take  the  people  belonging  to  the  Scheduled  Castes, 

Scheduled  Tribes  Category  to  that  level  where  they  could  be  equal  to  others  in 

terms of education, the government is to blame for that.
