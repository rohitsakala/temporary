  This  Bill  is  a  revolutionary  approach 

towards  the  mental  healthcare.    Though  it  is  not  foolproof.    When  this  Bill  will 

become an Act, it will be of great help to change the general public attitude toward 

PMI persons.  It will prevent public to call them lunatic.  It is highly appreciable 

that  the  Bill  guarantees  certain  human  and  social  rights  to  PMI  persons  and  the 

right  to  easily  access  affordable,  good  quality,  minimum  healthcare  upto  the 

district level.   The Bill does not give any directive about what is the next thing to 

be done when the person is recovered from attempt to suicide. Another good thing 

is about insurance coverage.  For the mentally ill patients, who is going to decide 

he  or  she  is  in  solid mental  condition  to give  consent  regarding  admission, place 

and type of treatment.  That is a real fallacy in this Bill.  The Bill does not address 

the  old  people  regarding  property  management  of  the  PMI  persons.    This  is  the 

Bill which invited 124 amendments in Rajya Sabha.
