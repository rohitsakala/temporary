  I  congratulate  the  hon.  Minister  for 

having  such  a  comprehensive  Bill  after  detailed  discussion  in  the  Standing 

Committee,  in  Rajya  Sabha  and  also  in  this  House.    Globally,  there  are  36.7 

million  people,  who  are  living  with  HIV.    India  has  third  largest  population  of 

people  living  with  HIV  with  an  estimated  21  lakh  people  after  South  Africa  and 

Nigeria.  It is satisfying to note that the national HIV epidemic has declined over 

the last 15 years or so.  We hope, this Bill will give further boost to India's efforts 

in  fulfilling  the  global  commitments  towards  ending  the  AIDS  epidemic  by  the 

year 2030.  People living with HIV are still dying in our country, particularly when 

co-infected  with  TB  or  Hepatitis-C  even  when  we  have  knowledge  and  means  to 

prevent  such  deaths.    The  Bill  says  that  the  Central  Government  and  the  State 

Governments  may  try  their  level  best  to  give  measures  for  providing  Anti-

Retroviral drugs as far as possible.  Our suggestion is that 'as far as possible' may 

be  deleted  and  a  specific  assurance  may  be  given  in  this  House.    India  supplies 

more than 80 per cent of the Anti-Retroviral medicines globally but it seems to be 

hesitating in committing to provide treatment to its own citizens.  Even with all the 

years of awareness and education, we have instances of stigma and discrimination 

against  people  living  with  HIV.    These  are  the  challenges  we  must  particularly 

have  in  mind  while  making  rules  in  this  regard.    The  discrimination  is  also  well 

addressed in this Bill.  I fully support this Bill.
