 Even after 65 years of independence a serious 

issue of housing has not been given proper attention, but our Government has set a 

target  of  constructing  6  crore dwelling units in the  country.   This step  will play  an 

important  role  in  poverty  alleviation.    An  amount  of  Rs.  10,000  crore  has  been 

allocated to initiate and complete the Metro Projects in the country to strengthen and 

streamline  the  urban  transport  facilities.    The  Government  have  sanctioned  Rs.  3 

thousand  crore  for  smart  city.   It  will definitely  help in  improving  the condition of 

our cities.
