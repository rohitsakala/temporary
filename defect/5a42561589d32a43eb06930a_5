  I  stand  here,  on  behalf  of  the  Telugu  Desam 

Party,  to  support  this  Bill.    Whenever  we  walk  about  any  Trust,  we  always  get 

reminded  of  the  Charitable  Trust,  Private  Trust  and  money  flowing  from  outside 

into  a  Trust.    After  that,  there  is  embezzlement  and  siphoning  of  the  money  into 

circulation.    There  are  certain  income-tax  exemptions  given  to  the  money 

deposited in a Trust.  That money needs to be investigated.  Unless this loophole is 

plugged,  a  Trust  can  become  a  haven  of  black-money.    Regarding  investing  in 

securities,  let  the  money  be  invested  in  the  social  sector  schemes,  poverty 

alleviation schemes and especially in the Railways.  Let there be public trust in the 

Trusts Act.  Please see to it that no activity recurs, no fraudulent means are used to 

misuse the Trusts Act.
