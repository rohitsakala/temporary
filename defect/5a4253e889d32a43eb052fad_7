  I have a very simple issue about clause 3 of 

this  new  Bill  which  says  that  there  is  a  presumption  of  innocence  in  favour  of  a 

juvenile  and  the  definition  is  below  18  years.    But  clause  16  (1)  says  that  the 

Juvenile  Justice  Board  enters  upon  an  inquiry  about  the  circumstances  of  an 

offence.    The  moment  you  enter  upon  that  inquiry,  that  trial  is  going  against  his 

right under the Constitution not to incriminate himself.  The second point I would 

like  to  say  is  this.    Do  we  as  a  nation  want  to  say,  that, 1.2  per  cent  people  who 

have committed crimes are children and we have put them away?
