 This Bill has been introduced for setting up 

an educational institution which will give recognition to the degrees of the children 

students studying such courses.  Such institutes are in private sector abroad and not 

in public sector because public sector companies do not manufacture footwear, it is 

the private companies which manufacture them.  Here, all the institutes are set up 

by  the  Government.    It  is  not  clear  whether  the  running  cost  as  well  as  cost  of 

setting up of such institution will be on the basis of self-financing.  There is a need 

to have a detailed information regarding the nature of courses of these institutions, 

their level and number.  The Government should endeavour to provide footwear to 

every person's feet.   The Government provided budget allotment for the footwear 

institute.  It was Rs. 109 crore during 2015-2016, Rs.25 crore during 2016-17, but 

only Rs. One lakh is being given this year.  We  are unable to understand how the 

government  intends  to  support  it.    To  compete  with  the  high  value  footwear  of 

international companies, courses and industries should be of the same scale so that 

their  production  should  be  of  international  standard.    Courses  should  be  as  per 

requirements of the industry and after completion of courses the students should be 

provided employment and salary as per the course they study.
