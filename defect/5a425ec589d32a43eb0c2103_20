  I  would  request  the  Hon.  Finance  Minister  to 

discontinue the MPLAD Scheme completely.  The recommendation of Member of 

Parliament  should  be  made  compulsory  in  all  the  centrally  sponsored  schemes.  

The  Government  of  India  should  also  make  it  compulsory  to  set  up  diagnostic 

centres at Panchayat level.  I would urge the hon. Finance Minister that our whole 

economy is limited to our corporate sector and it needs to be decentralized.  There 

is  no  provision  for  workers  in  this  Budget.    The  government  has  not  paid  any 

attention towards Anganwadi workers.  The remuneration of ASHA and MAMTA 

workers  should  be  upwardly  revised.    The  condition  of  sub-health  centres  should 

be  improved  as  they  are  in  bad  shape.    Unless  the  Government  revise  the 

remuneration  of  teachers  from  Rs.40,000  to  Rs.70,000,  they  will  not  feel 

encouraged  to  put  their  best  in  teaching.  I  would  demand  that  Bihar  should  be 

given  a  special  package.    The  Government  has  not  given  any  thing  to  Bihar  for 

roads  and  agriculture.    There  is  a  need  for  an  AIIMS  in  Bihar  for  healthcare.    I 

agree that the Government of Bihar has not given land for it.  I would, therefore, 

want that the AIIMS should be set up at Kosi or in border area.  Finally, I would 

demand that sport should be given due priority.  The Government  has not paid any 

attention to the agriculture sector.
