  A  demand  for  separate  statehood  for  Uttarakhand 

had constantly been raised for years together due to geographical conditions of the 

state. A lot of sacrifices were made and a number of lives were laid down for this 

cause  but  we  did    not  get  the  statehood  during  the  Congress  regime.  We  got  the 

separate state during the prime ministership of Shri Atal Ji. We got the status of a 

special state and also got industrial packages then only the development of the state 

received momentum. Even today we do not have motorable roads and a number of 

villages  are  still  devoid  of  electricity  and  connectivity  and  there  is  shortage  of 

drinking water. A plenty of forest land is required to carry out all these works. Our 

state  remains  always  prone  to  natural  calamities.  Uttarakhand  has  witnessed 

several  natural  disasters  over  the  years.  I  would  also  like  to  point  out  that  our 

Uttarakhand  is  predominantly  a  state  of  soldiers.  The  Union  Government  has 

extended  tremendous  benefits  to  people  of  the  state  by  implementing  the  "One 

Rank  one  Pension"  scheme.  We  have  abundant  resources  for  power-generation. 

We  have  huge  glaciers.  A  number  of  rivers  originate  from  the  state  and  flow 

downwards  to  the  plains  of  the  entire  country  such  a  vast  potential  exists  in 

Uttarakhand.  A  large  number  of  people  visit  the  state  as  tourists  but  the  real 

hardships being faced by the local people there need to be addressed.
