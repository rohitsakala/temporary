  The 

Government  had  a  challenge  before  it  to  bring  in  transparency  in  mining  and 

promote it.  This Amendment will certainly bolstered the mining business as well 

as  production  of  minerals  in  the  country.    There  has  been  a  transparency  in  the 

allocation  of  mines.    Today,  regular  allocation  of  mines  is  going  on.    The  State 

Governments  are  getting  increased  value  of  their  minerals  and  the  illegal  mining 

has  also  stopped.    Thereafter,  this  Government  has  received  some  memorandum 

requesting  that  the  Government,  while  amending  this  Act  has  inserted  a  Clause 

12(a)  thereby  banning    the  transfer  of  existing  mines  be  they  are  captive  or 

merchant  mines.    As  per  the  provisions  of  the  Act  only  those  minerals    can  be 

transferred, mines of which were got through auction.  This is really troubling the 

industry.    Owing  to  it,  the  recovery  of  money  of  banks  invested  in  this  industry 

which is turning into NPA and is getting difficult.  Therefore, the government has 

brought  this  Amendment  to  clear  the  transfer  of  such  captive  mines.    The 

Government has also defined the mineral lease.
