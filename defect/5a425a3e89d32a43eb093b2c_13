  Footwear  Design  and  Development  Institute 

Bill, 2017 is to develop the excellence in footwear and leather products design.  It 

will be very desirable if this becomes a national institute with 12 campuses and at 

par  with  the  IITs,  IIMs  and  IISERs.    So,  this  will  give  the  profession  much 

respectability.  It has been mentioned that the leather market will be 220 billion in 

the world by 2020.  But, none of Indian brands are global.  So, must improve the 

quality  of  our  footwear  to  really  complete  globally.    We  must  also  give 

encouragement to our local brands like Kolhapuri and make them an international 

brand along with patenting the name, Kolhapuri.  West Bengal is a big centre for 

leather industry.  One of the campuses of the Institute of Footwear is situated in the 

Leather  Complex  at  Kolkata.    I  request  the  Government  to  give  it  a  special 

attention.    I  would  also  like  to  ask  that  what  is  the  policy  of  the  Government 

towards procuring hide and skin of animals. As we know, cow slaughter is banned 

except in West Bengal, Kerala and the Northeastern states.   So, my question is, if 

the ban continues, where will we get the leather from?
