  Before  independence,  'Bakshish'  was 

given.    My  objection  is  that  the  limit  from  Rs.  10,000  has  been  increased  to  Rs. 

21,000  due  to  which  only  a  few  would  benefit  and  the  others  whether  in  high 

position working in the same department should not they also get something?  How 

much  is  it  justified  to  announce  the  bonus  or  attempt  to  change  the  act  when  the 

pay commission report is awaited.  I support my colleagues contention that bonus 

be paid whether the company is in profit or in loss.  Apart from bonus clause 31 a 

refers to productivity linked bonus.  Both the things have been clubbed in the same 

clause.    My  slight  objection  is  that  when  pay  commission  recommendation  are 

likely  to  be  accepted  shortly  then  what  is  the  need  for  bringing  the  amendment 

now.
