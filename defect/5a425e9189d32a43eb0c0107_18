    Presently,  about  31  per  cent  of  Indian 

population lives in urban areas and the rate of urbanization is expected to increase in 

the next 10  to  15  years.   It increases  the demand  for  housing and  basic  services  in 

urban areas.  Shortage of housing units is expected to increase to 20 million by 2022.  

There are no rains in the villages and there is no agriculture.  So, many agriculturists, 

landlords are migrating to urban areas and becoming labours.  Having all that, there 

is 28 per cent decrease, that is, in 2015-16 the total expenditure was Rs.5634 crore 

but now in 2016-17, it is Rs.5411 crore.    

 

The  Central  Government  is  providing  Rs.1.5  lakh  for  each  house  of  360 

square feet area.  The house of 360 square feet area is very small in size.  But today 

the state government of Telangana is providing houses of 560 square feet area with 

one kitchen, one bathroom, two bed rooms and a hall to those people only for Rs.7 

lakh  on  full  subsidy  in  urban  areas.    We  have  a  target  of  two  lakh  houses  for  this 

year and we have already completed 60,000 houses.  A person migrating from rural 

area to urban area needs some cash for starting his business or for settling.  He needs 

employment.    For  this,  the  state  government  of  Telangana  is  providing  a  loan  of 

Rs.10 lakh with 50 per cent subsidy.  What I mean to say is that the budget of this 

Ministry should be increased and the funds spent properly.
