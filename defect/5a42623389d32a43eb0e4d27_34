  I  oppose  the  Bill  due  to 

some valid and genuine reasons. The Bill, which appears to do away with  the child 

labour  up  to  the  age  of  18,  has  two  caveats  which  would  have  the  effect  of 

legitimizing  child  labour  through  backdoor  and  increase  exploitation  of  children. 

The Bill allows for legalizing child labour. Allowing children to work in so-called 

family  enterprises  would  legalize  at  least  three-fourth  of  child  work  which 

presently  is  unlawful.  Legalizing  children  in  audio-visual  entertainment  industry 

will  put  them  in  harmful  situation.    This  law,  under  Section  18  criminalises  the 

parents, which is not in the best interest of the child. The shortened schedule omits 

many  occupations  which  have  devastating  effects  on  the  physical  and  mental 

health of the child.
