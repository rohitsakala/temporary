 The Government will have to increase the staff strength in 

the income tax department to properly implement this Act because they are under 

staffed presently.  It will be easy to curb benami transactions through digitization 

because  it  would  lead  to  trace  such  transactions.    The  deadline  for  declaring 

undisclosed  income  is  30th  September.    This  will  help  in  registering  benami 

transactions  in  the  name  of  real  owner.    Moreover,  people  have  to  pay  tax  at  the 

rate of 45 percent on such income, this would significantly increase the revenue of 

the government.  But this has to be taken care of that the immunity which is being 

given  should not  be violated  because  there  are  apprehensions  in  the  minds of  the 

people that the income tax department might reopen their cases in future.  The hon. 

Finance  Minister  should  pay  attention  to  this  fact  also.    Once  this  Act  is 

operationalised,  it  would  definitely  increase  revenue  to  the  exchequer  of  the 

Government.
