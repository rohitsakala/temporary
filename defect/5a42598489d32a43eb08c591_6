  I  would  like  to  support  the  National 

Institutes  of  Technology,  Science  Education  and  Research  (Amendment)  Bill, 

2016.  The National Institute of Technology is an institution of national importance 

which provides  education  of  technology,  management, science, and  its subsidiary 

subjects.  I am of the opinion that the number of seats should be increased in NITs.  

I am also of the opinion that the number of NITs should be increased in the state 

according to their size and population.  For instance, the population of Goa is less 

than  that  of  my  district  itself  and  there  is  an  NIT  whereas  the  population  of 

Maharashtra is more than 11 crore and there is also an NIT - this is not justifiable. I 

would  like  to  urge  you  that  an  NIT  should  be  set  up  in  Marathwada  region.    Six 

new NITs have been proposed to be set up by the Government which is a welcome 

move.    Given  the  increasing  interest  of  the  students  in  engineering  and  higher 

education,  the  adequate  steps  will  have  to  be  taken  to  set  up  NITs  in  adequate 

number  in  large  states.    Moreover,  the  condition  of  NIT  located  in  North-East 

needs to be improved.  I would also like to draw the attention of the hon. Minister 

to  the  increasing  number  of  suicides  committed  by  the  students  in  the  coaching 

centres of Kota.  This is a serious issue.  Proper measures should be taken in this 

regard.
