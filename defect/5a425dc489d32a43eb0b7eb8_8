   In this  proposed Bill, an amendment has  been 

made to accord permission to captive mining lease that are otherwise not given on 

auction.    The  mines  which  have  not  been  transferred  there  is  loss  of  production, 

companies  did  not  repay  their  bank  debt,  so  these  mines  were  on  the  verge  of 

closure and no employment was given in these mines.   The government has taken 

a decision  to bring about an Amendment in the law.  Even the State Bank of India 

has  informed  the  department  that  several  companies  had  financed  through  their 

bank and through other banks private financing was also done but they could not 

pay  back  their  debt.    Similarly,  by  the  provision  of  transfer  in  this  Bill,  business  

would  be  made  easy  by  the  acquisition.    Amendment  in  section  3  would  bring 

provision  of  defining  the  leased  area  which  is  not  at  present.    There  are  many 

mines which are with the people for 50 years and 90 years period.  Where there is 

no  plant  or  industry  established.    But  they  have  a  mine  and  this  is  with  the 

provision that if they transfer it, whether that industry will also become a part of it 

or  not.    I  understand  that  there  should  also  be  a  provision  that  small  mines  and 

minerals,  which  generate  employment.  The  big  people  get  financial  help  through 

banks but small entrepreneurs and specially educated youth want to set up an small 

industry,  so  they  should  get  facility.    Trade  regarding  minerals  should  flourish.  

There  is  mineral  wealth  in  our  country  but  we  are  not  making  proper  use  of  this 

mineral wealth.  If we properly utilize this mineral wealth and provide employment 

through  it,  our  income  shall  grow  and  new  employment  will  be  generated  and 

Make in India will become successful.  I support the Bill.
