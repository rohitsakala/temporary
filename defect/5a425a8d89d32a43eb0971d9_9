    I  fully  support  this  Election  Laws 

(Amendment) Bill 2016.  It is very interesting to note that 14,864 persons living in 

erstwhile  Bangladesh  enclaves  now  amalgamated  to  Indian  territory  opted  to 

acquire Indian citizenship and 987 people out of 39, 176 persons living in Indian 

enclaves transferred to Bangladesh territory opted to retain Indian citizenship and 

settled in India in Cooch Behar District of West Bengal.  The point which I would 

like  to  highlight  is  the  inordinate  delay  cause  by  the  Government  of  Indian  in 

having such enabling provision empowering the Election Commission to have this 

delimitation. This legislation has to be passed.  Otherwise, these people who have 

opted  for  Indian  citizenship  will  be  denied  the  right  to  vote.    There  is  inordinate 

delay on the part of the Government in bringing such a legislation so that political 

rights  of  these  persons  are  recognized.    The  second  point  is  with  regard  to  the 

urgency  of  passing  the  Bill.    Why  is  the  Bill  not  specifying  the  date  of 

commencement  on  1st  September  or  with  immediate  effect?    By  going  for  a 

Gazette Notification by the Government of India so that the Bill has to come into 

effect, delay may take place.  Kindly look into this fact.  Another point is regarding 

Clause 2 of the Bill.  I would like to know what is meant by the 'relevant areas'?  

Whatever  areas  are  included  and  whatever  is  excluded,  definitely  all  the  areas 

which  have  been  ceded  to  our  country  and  which  have  been  detached  from  the 

country  should  come.    So,  the  world  '  relevant'  is  making  some  suspicion  or 

confusion.  So, kindly clarify on that point.
