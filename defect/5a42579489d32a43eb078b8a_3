  I  would  like  to  seek  certain  clarifications 

from the Union Minister whether this facilitation for “demerger” is confined only 

to  the  Public  Sector  Companies  of  the  Union  Government  or  applicable  for  the 

State run Public Sector Companies too. Secondly, whether the Government has any 

plans to transfer the shares of those PSUs which have  ceased to exist now to other 

Public  Sector  companies  while  splitting  up  or  reconstructing  the  companies.  The 

Union  Minister  has  to  clarify  whether  this  reduction  of  period  of  employment  is 

from  240  days  to  150  days  is  applicable  only  for  manufacturing  of  apparel  or 

applicable  to  all  other  seasonal  businesses.  Will  increasing  tariff  rate  of  customs 

duty  from  10  per  cent  to  40  per  cent  on  marble  and  granite  not  affect  the 

quantitative  and  qualitative  needs  of  the  domestic  markets?  I  hope  the  Finance 

Minister will clarify this for the benefit of the people of our country.
