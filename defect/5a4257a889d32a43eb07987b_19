  The Government is effecting these 

two amendments on the demands of the industries. The Government should bring 

in the amendment Bill which was brought in the year 2016 for the benefit of forty 

Crore  labourers  during  the  next  session  of  the  Parliament.  The  Government  has 

increased the number of overtime hours but no increase has been made  in the rate 

of  overtime.  Several  industries  pay  overtime  on  basic  salary  and  dearness 

allowance  thereon.  I  demand  that  the  rate  of  overtime  should  be  fixed  on  gross 

salary. Provisions to this effect should be there in this Bill.
