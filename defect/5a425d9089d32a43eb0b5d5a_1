  I  strongly  oppose  the  introduction  of  the  Bill.    This  Bill  is 

circulated today morning at around nine o'clock.  It is a very important Bill where 

structural changes are being brought in the Labour Acts like Minimum Wages Act, 

Payment  of  Gratuity  Act,  etc.    Today,  at  this  time,  I  am  not  able  to  oppose  the 

Constitutional as well as the Legislative competence of the Bill because I could not 

go through the contents of the Bill.  It means that the right of a Member is being 

infringed.    Why  is  the  Government  bringing  this  Bill  in  a  hurried  and  hasty 

manner?  It means that you want to avoid the opposition to the introduction of the 

Bill.  Most of the labour laws are in the Concurrent List.  But unfortunately, none 

of the States in the country is even consulted.  Hon. Minister has assured the House 

that the gratuity will be enhanced from Rs. 10 lakh to Rs. 20 lakh.  Those workers 

who are getting retrenched or retied will be losing the benefit.
