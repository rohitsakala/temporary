  Land is a State  subject.   It would  have 

been  a  better  idea,  had  this  been  sent  as  a  model  Bill  to  the  States,  with  States 

enacting  their  own  Bill  to  regulate  the  real  estate  sector.  This  Bill  would  bring 

several state Government agencies under the purview of the Act.  The Bill provides 

for prior registration of real estate projects with a Real Estate Regulatory Authority 

and  talks  about  the  area  and  number  of  apartments.    The  power  to  modify  the 

threshold  limit  should  vest  with  the  State  government  and  should  not  be 

appropriated  by  the  Central  Government.    The  amount  realized  for  real  estate 

project  from  the  allottees,  from  time  to  time,  shall  be  deposited  in  a  separate 

account  to  be  maintained  in  a  scheduled  bank  and  shall  be  used  only  for  that 

purpose.    It  should  also  be  made  mandatory  for  the  promoter  to  submit  the 

accounts  for  the  projects  to  the  Real  Estate  Regulatory  Authority  every  quarter.  

There  should  be  penal  provision,  apart  from  the  return  of  the  amount  and 

compensation if the promoter fails to complete or unable to give the possession of 

apartment  or  building.    This  Bill  will  result  in  making  homes  and  flats  more 

expensive in India.  This would drive genuine, small time marginal developers out 

of the realty business and MNCs would only thrive.
