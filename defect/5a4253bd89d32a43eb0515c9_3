  The  Bill  is  good  and  I  support  it 

except  for  a  few  clarifications  that  are  required.    There  is  this  point  about 

compensation.    It  has  not  been  left  to  the  judiciary  but  to  the  executive.    Death 

penalty  has  been  stressed  upon  in  this  amended  Bill  but  I  do  not  know  whether 

death penalty alone will be a proper deterrent.  The CISF is a force that is guarding 

all our  airports.   The  airports  are very  hi-tech  establishments  and the  CISF is  not 

trained  or  not  equipped  to  handle  the  exigencies  that  might  arise  at  any  time.    I 

believe  that  it  is  time  we  developed  a  special  force  exclusively  meant  for  airport 

security.  Everyone including VIPs should go through the same scrutiny.  The third 

point I would like to mention is that there are these hoax calls and fake hijacking.  

We must not allow hijacking to happen, and to stop that, you have to make things 

better which you are not doing.  You must have no VIP treatment for anybody.
