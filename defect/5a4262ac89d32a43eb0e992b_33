 This Bill  has been introduced for Amendment 

in  National  Waterways  Bill  2015.  We  express  our  gratitude  to  the  hon.  Minister.  

Whose for sightedness has helped. They have started work for bringing 101 rivers 

under National Waterways.  This is a good initiative.  We must welcome this step.  

We  have  only  referred  to  5  rivers  but  101  are  indentified.    First  of  all  the 

requirement is this that this is dredging of river bed. Where there is lodging  and 

un-lodging work.  Employment would be generated all the old cities are located on 

the banks of rivers. They are not getting facilities.  If we start National Waterways, 

this would bring new life and prosperity and developmental activities would start. 

New  infrastructure  should  be  made  ready  for  this.    With  the  inauguration  of 

National Waterways development, works would start.
