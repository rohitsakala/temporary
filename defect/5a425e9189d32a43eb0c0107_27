  Housing  should  be  made 

available  to  all  the  Zonal  City  Headquarters  including  Bhagalpur  and  Munger  and 

the  poor  people  of  Bihar  as  well.  The  issue  of  facilities  and  amenities  needs  to  be 

addressed  for  the  poor  and  the  marginalised  people.    The  basic  requirement  of  the 

poor  such  as  two  squares  meal,  clothes  and  houses  have  not  yet  been  fulfilled.  

Therefore,  attention  should  be  paid 

towards 

the  creation  of  employment 

opportunities.    We  talk  about  smart  cities  but  it  is  more  imperative  to  ensure 

sanitation  facilities in slums.
