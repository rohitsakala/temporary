    I  would  like  to  thank  the  government 

for  envisaging  the  setting  up  of  20  IITs  on  PPP  mode  keeping  in  view  the  national 

requirements  and  also  the  prevailing  circumstances  at  the  national  and  international 

level.  I find that there is a great disparity between the requirement of the industry and 

our educational system.  This Bill is going to fill this gap.  I would certainly like to 

say  that  such  institutes  will  certainly  be  able  to  churn  out  the  technicians,  in  both 

qualitative and quantitative terms to match the pace and requirement of the progress 

being made in the country under the Make in India programme.  It is for the first time 

that  15  such  institutes  are  being  set  up  in  the  country.  Today  our  institutes  are  not 

research  oriented  and  if  we  make  them  research  oriented  then  certainly  it  will  be  a 

useful step for the country.  I would like  the government to make a provision under 

which it is made obligatory upon the IITians  to serve for atleast 10-15 years in the 

country before migrate to foreign countries and a bond to this effect could be made to 

sign  by  them.    The  existing  24  institutes  should  be  linked  to  the  institutions  like 

DRDO,  ISRO  etc.  to  benefit  these  institutes.    There  is  a  need  to  establish  defence 

institutes in Ujjain also.
