  I  would  like  to  congratulate  hon. 

Prime Minister and Finance Minister for bringing in an amendment after a lapse of 

28  years.    This  is  really  a  very  important  bill  brought  in  before  the  Lok  Sabha.  

Today corruption is the commonly used word in our country.  People are resorting 

to corruption  to get  their  work done  and they  have  completely  sidelined the  right 

course.  People are giving bribes because they avoid paying so many taxes levied 

under  our  taxation  system.    And  moreover,  it  has  become  very  difficult  to  earn 

money honestly and earn a livelihood easily nowadays. Most of the black money 

generated in this country is being invested in the real estate.  Black money invested 

in this sector is not disclosed before the government authorities.  People are of the 

opinion that if they have to pay 55 per cent tax on their hard earned money to the 

government  then  why  be  honest.    So,  there  is  a  need  to  bring  comprehensive 

change in the taxation system.  Protection should be provided to those people who 

are honest.  The Hindu undivided Family has been well defined in this Bill and it 

will  provide  relief  to  the  common  people.    Again  there  is  a  need  to  curb  the 

tendency  of  threatening  the  common  people  by  the  income  tax  officials.  

Restrictions should be imposed on generation of black money through this Bill and 

protection must be provided to those who are honest.
