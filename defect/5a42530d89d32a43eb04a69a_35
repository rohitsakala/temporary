 The farmers work day and night to feed the 

nation  yet  they  are  unable  even  to  recover  their  cost.    The  middlemen  make  the 

killing.    Farmers  take  loans  to  raise  crops.    A  system  should  be  developed  to 

provide easy loans to farmers and to enable them to get their loans waived off.  The 

hon.  Prime  Minister  had  promised  to  make  North-East  a  hub  of  organic  farming.  

Each  year  floods  in  Assam  wreck  havoc  on  farmers.    Such  farmers  should  be 

compensated adequately.  Every year, due to erosion caused by floods hundreds of 

acres  of  agricultural  land  is  swallowed  by  Brahmaputra.   Unless  and  until  efforts 

are  made  to  prevent  floods  in  Brahmaputra  river  the  farmers  in  Assam  will  not 

progress.  In Assam farmers are exploited excessively.  They are forced to sell their 

produce at throwaway price.  I demand this should be prevented.  Demonetization 

also affected farming.  Loans of farmers should be waived off and they should be 

provided relief.  The condition of tea growers in Assam is very pathetic.  Fisheries 

can be highly successful in Assam.  This should be looked into it.  Efforts  should 

be made to revive the Jute industry.
