    The  Government  has  launched  a  comprehensive 

mission named "Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Housing for All (Urban). Under this 

Yojana,  it  is  proposed  to  build  2  crore  houses  for  the  urban  poor  including 

downtrodden, economically weaker sections and lower income groups in urban areas 

by the year 2022.  Taking the chance of housing crisis in urban areas, some builders 

are coming out with various illegal fraudulent housing schemes.  If it is not checked 

then it will be a big scam. The Government should take strong legal, criminal action 

against these builders.  The Government also issue order to the appropriate authority 

to seize the bank balance and other assets of these builders.  I request the Housing 

Ministry  to  initiate  criminal  proceedings  against  such  builders  to  protect  the 

common man.
