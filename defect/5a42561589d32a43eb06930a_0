 The Indian Trust Act was formulated 

in 1882.  When the Indian Trusts Act. 1882 was formulated, section 20 notified in 

a  very  precise  and  detailed  way  the  financial  instruments  that  could  be  used  to 

invest these funds.  Those provisions have become completely archaic now.  The 

time has come to remove those archaic provisions and to replace them with modern 

day  financial  instruments.    What  we  have  said  in  effect  is  that  if  we  put  this  in 

place the Indian Trusts Act will be ready for the 21st Century and be  able to help 

the  people  who  are  the  beneficiaries  of  those  trusts.    The  amendments  seek  to 

amend  sections  20  and  20  (a)  of  the  Act.    Which  will  give  the  trustees  greater 

autonomy and flexibility in investments.  This Bill was introduced in 2009.  It went 

to  the  Standing  Committee.    Most  of  the  recommendations  of  the  Standing 

Committee  were  accepted  and  that  is  the  amendment  that  is  now  proposed  to  be 

considered and passed by this august House.
