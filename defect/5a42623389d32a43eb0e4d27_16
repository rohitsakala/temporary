  The  number  of  child  labour  is  highest  in 

our country.  Children are compelled to work in farms, factories etc. due to weaker 

economic condition of their families.  They have no option but to work to earn a 

living for them.  As per a report of the last year, about 5,000 children disappeared 

in Assam alone.  Where do these children go?  Nobody knows about this.  These 

are  the  issues  which  need  to  be  considered  seriously  because  we  cannot  find  a 

solution to this problem by amending laws alone.  Today, the need of the hour is to 

provide education to such children.  We are providing education to  such children 

through  the  Ajmal  Foundation  in  our  state  and  we  have  achieved  cent  percent 

success  on  this  count.    All  the  Members  of  Parliament  could    also  prevent  child 

labour in their areas by making arrangements for education of these children.
