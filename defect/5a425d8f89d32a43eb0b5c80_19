 I rise to oppose this Bill in toto on two 

grounds  -  on  technical  ground  and  also  on  merits.    For  what  purpose,  the 

Parliament functions?  The Parliament is not just for putting a stamp on the actions 

of the Executive.  The State Bank of Hyderabad is constituted by virtue of the State 

Bank of Hyderabad Act, 1956.  All other four banks have been established by way 

of  the  State  Bank  of  India  (Subsidiary  Banks)  Act,  1959.    These  two  are  the 

creations of the Parliament.  Our creations are being taken away without informing 

and without getting consent of the House.  I feel that it is a breach of the right of 

the  Parliament.    This  is  not  a  good  practice  for  the  Parliamentary  democracy.    I 

request  and  appeal  to  the  Government  to  look  into.    I  am  coming  on  the  merits.  

The idea behind this merger is to create a big bank of world-class size but in India 

we  do  not  need  very  big  banks.    We  need  good  banks  to  serve  the  needs  of  the 

common  people.    Kindly  see  the  implications  of  the  merger.    It  is  observed  that 

after  the  merger,  SBI  is  having  the  largest  share  of  bad  debt.    The  Kerala 

Government  is  opposing  the  merger.    So,  I  would  request  the  Government  to 

kindly consider it and review its decision and go back with decentralization of the 

banks.
