 I thank the Hon. Minister Shri Gehlot 

for piloting this landmark bill in this august House. I urge upon the Hon. Minister 

to kindly allot money for scholarships in time to the reserved category student. In

category  list.  However,  several  other  castes  have  not  yet  been  included  in  the 

reserved  category.  Their  exclusion  from  the  list  is  a  denial  of  justice  to  these 

castes.  Certain  castes  from  Uttar  Pradesh  were  included  in  the  SC  category  list. 

These  castes  reaped  the  benefit  of  reservations.  But,  the  same  castes  present  in 

Punjab,  Goa  etc.  were  not  brought  in  the  ambit  of  reservations.  The  castes  that 

have been included in reserved category list in Uttar Pradesh should also get  the 

reservation benefits at the all-India level.
