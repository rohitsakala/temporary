  At the  outset, I  would like to  wish to 

bring  to  the  notice  of  the  august  House  that  what  is  the  purpose  of  merging?  

Because  one  of  the  stated  objectives  of  the  Government  seems  to  be,  to  create  a 

bigger bank so that we get good rankings or great ratings from the credit agencies 

of the world.  Previously, we used to think of decentralization, now we are thinking 

of  centralization.    Today,  however  the  picture  of  bank  is  bad  loans,  which  is 

because of big people.  No loans are given to the small people.  There is also non-

accountability  aspect.    I  am  talking  about  one  district  in  the  State  of  Telangana. 

They  have  disbursed  a  credit  of  Rs.6,750  crore.    But,  banks  have  disbursed  only 

Rs.511  crore  for  the  priority  lending  sector  whereas  they  have  disbursed  the 

maximum amount of loan to the bigger people.  I wish that the Government should 

take  into  account  this  aspect  which  is  exactly  affecting  the  poor  people.  The 

Government has gone into various pros and cons of the issue by having this merger 

like, reduction of the NPA, technical efficiency, international standards and so on.  

My only concern is that we going to miss the regional focus of the bank?  So, we 

have  to  be  extremely  careful  about  it  and  I  do  want  the  Government  of  India  to 

take up the issue.  Banks are discriminating a person on the ground of profession. 

We  wholeheartedly  wish  that  this  merger  will  result  in  a  better  future  for  the 

smaller people.
