  The BIS hallmarking  is essential for the Indian 

industries  to  facilitate  the  export  of  their  goods.    The  biggest  beneficiary  will  be 

Indian consumer because he will be assured that he is getting quality product.  This 

Bill  was  essential  to  make  India  a  world  leader  in  the  realm  of  industry.    The 

biggest  benefit  of  this  Bill  is  that  when  we  will  approach  the  WTO,  they  have  a 

rule  that  if  there  is  a  standard  for  any  product  in  our  country,  we  will  have  to 

export  the  same  standard  of  product  in  other  countries.    Besides,  the  BIS  has 

formulated over 19300 standards for more than 9500 products but only 92 products 

are covered.  I would like to thank the hon. Minister that he is thinking of covering 

more than 400 products.  The more products we cover it would be better.  Besides, 

services and processes have been covered in this Bill for the first time.  It is a very 

good step.  Moreover, the planning for smart cities, food even drinking water are 

also  being  brought  under  its  ambit.    I  would  like  to  give  some  suggestions.    My 

first  suggestion  is  that  there  is  misuse  of  ISI  mark  in  the  country  on  large  scale.  

There  are  many  companies  which  manufacture  sub-standard  goods  but  sell  these 

goods  after  embossing  ISI  mark  on  these  goods  and  consumer  is  unable  to 

distinguish  as  to  these  goods  are  fake  or  genuine  ones.  There  should  be  a 

mechanism in place to check the genuineness of goods across the country.  If we 

are  giving  self  accreditation  power  to  industries  and  if  they  do  any  wrong,  there 

should  be  stringent  punishment.    Similar,  provision  should  also  be  made 

particularly for food items.
