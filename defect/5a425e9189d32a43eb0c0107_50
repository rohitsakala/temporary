    Despite the  Member  of  Parliament 

of Kanpur Rural, I am directly related to the city and its development and I have got 

an opportunity to see its miseries very closely.  Migration from villages to cities due 

to geographical, social and economic reasons is breaking the backbone of cities.  In 

such a scenario it was necessary that in one side large scale migration from villages 

must be stopped and on the other side infrastructure of city should be strengthened.  

It  is  painful  to  note  that  Kanpur  has  not  been  included  in  the  list  of  Smart  City 

despite  having  many  qualities.    This  city  has  lost  its  place  due  to  negligence  of 

previous governments and almost all industries have migrated from here and lack of 

infrastructure  facilities,  business  is  also  losing  its  grip.    It  is  very  unfortunate  that 

previous  UP  Governments  also  did  not  do  any  justice  to  this  city.    There  is  acute 

shortage  of  drinking  water  in  the  city  due  to  leakage  at  more  than  90  locations.  

Funds  allocated  under  JNNURM  Scheme  is  being  highly  misappropriated.    Every 

work executed under the said scheme must be probed.  I would like to urge upon the 

Govt. to develop such a monitoring mechanism, so that at least basic facilities must 

be made available to the people living in the city.  I would like to request the Hon'ble 

Minister to include Kanpur city in the list of Smart City.
