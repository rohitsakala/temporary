 All that I wanted to say that as a Member of the 

Standing  Committee  on  Finance,  we  had  eight  meetings  on  the  Benami 

Transactions Bill and we gave a unanimous report in which we said that fresh law 

should be brought.  I want to ask the hon. Minister that why is it that you chose to 

over-ride the unanimous recommendation of the Finance Committee and go ahead 

with the Bill.  The intention of the Minister to eradicate black money is good.  But 

by  bringing  this  Act,  he  is  opening  the  path  to  hell  because  in  the  Statement  of 

Objects and Reasons of the Bill does not state that the purpose is to eradicate black 

money.   This  Act has  a  provision  for  confiscation under 27(1)  and  it  is  vested in 

the  Central  Government  whereas  it  should  have  been  vested  in  the  State 

Government which allocated land.  Lastly, I think this will open a serious problem 

in  rural  areas  where  there  are  no  proper  land  records  and  there  are  cash 

transactions.  Moreover, the existing Income Tax Act has adequate provisions and 

teeth to deal with issues such as tax evasion and unaccounted income.  Therefore, 

he should take back the Bill today and go for a new Bill.
