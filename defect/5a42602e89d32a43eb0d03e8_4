 The amendment in this Bill seeks to endow on 

Indian Institute of Technology, Design and Manufacturing at Kurnool in the state 

of Andhra Pradesh the status of national importance.  I urge the Government to set 

up  an  Indian  Institute  of  Technology,  Design  and  Manufacturing  at  Mumbai 

Metropolitan  Region  (MMR)  as  well.   Shiv  Sena is  really  concerned  about  white 

collared  middle  class  youths  losing  their  jobs  in  the  Indian  IT  industry.    We  are 

also  concerned  about  Indian  farmers.    Many  analysts  have  been  forecasting  big 

layoffs in Indian IT sector.  What steps is the Government taking to stop job losses 

and  layoffs  in  IT  sector?    IT  companies  sit  on  huge  cash  buffers,  they  go  for 

overseas  acquisitions.    They  go  for  instant  hire  and  fire  policy.    This  should  be 

stopped  immediately.    If  we  can  save  rich  corporates  from  bank  NPAs, it is high 

time  we  equally  save  white  collared  youth  of  middle  class  from  being  abruptly 

fired from IT Industries.  I am concluding my speech in support of the Bill.
