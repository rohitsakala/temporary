 There are large number of homeless people 

in  urban  areas.    The  Central  Government  should  prepare  a  scheme  for  their 

rehabilitation  on  the 

lines  of  Slum  Improvement  Scheme  of  Maharashtra 

Government.  The  State  Government  is  prepared  to  rehabilitate  the  people  living  in 

slums  on  the  land  of  the  Central  Government.    In  this  connection  the  Central 

Government should accord its approval to the State Government.  Necessary funds 

may be made available for Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and   

Medium  Town  and  Urban  Infrastructure  and  Governance.    Maharashtra  has  been 

allocated only 13 crore rupees out of the sanctioned amount of Rs. 547 crore in the 

year 2013-14.  A fund  of Rs. 4 thousand crore was announced for Housing for All 

Scheme  in  2015-16,  but  only  1,231  crore  and  23  lakh  rupees  have  been  given  in 

revised estimate.  4,400 crores have been sanctioned for the year 2016-17.  I would 

request the Central Government to allocate complete funds to the states so that slum 

improvement work could be accelerated.
