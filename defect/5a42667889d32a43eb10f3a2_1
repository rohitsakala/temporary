 This piece of legislation, which 

is dealing with the rights of the disabled persons, is the most important legislation 

and  needs  a  special  consideration.    This  Bill  addresses  most  of  the  issues  of  the 

disabled persons.  But there are certain lacunae also.  This Bill will benefit a large 

number of individuals with multiple impairments, who are the most disadvantaged 

sections  of  people  amongst  the  citizens.    But  the  quota  of  reservation  has  been 

reduced  from  05  per  cent  to  04  per  cent.    I  would  request  that  it  should  be 

increased.    As  far  as  the  concession  of  education  is  concerned,  the  unaided 

institutions should also be incorporated in the provision.  Under many Government 

schemes  stated  in  this  Bill,  the  physically  disabled  persons  will  get  25  per  cent 

benefit.  It should be increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent.   For reservation in 

private  sector, a  condition  has  been imposed, 'within  the  limits  of  their  economic 

capacity  and  development'.    That  is  a  real  excuse  for  them.    Therefore,  that 

condition  should  be  omitted.    Every  private  institution  or  company  should  also 

come  into  the  purview  of  this  Bill.    As  far  as  the  provision  of  Commissioner  is 

concerned  not  much  mandatory  power  is  there  for  the  Commissioner.    I  suggest 

that more powers should be given to the Commissioners.  People's representatives 

should be there in district level committees also.  In the State level Committee, the 

representation of Members of Parliament should also be there.  This Bill will create 

a remarkable change in the lives of the disabled people of India.  I expect that these 

suggestions and amendments will be accepted by the Government of India.  I am 

supporting this Bill.
