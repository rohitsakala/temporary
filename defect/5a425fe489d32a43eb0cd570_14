 In this Bill, new castes have been added 

in  the  States  of  Haryana,  Kerala  and  Chhattisgarh.    Some  castes  have  been 

excluded  from  the  state  of  Odisha  and  modification  has  been  made  in  the  list  of 

West  Bengal.    The  main  criterion  for  inclusion  of  the  Scheduled  Castes  is 

untouchability.  My humble request to the hon. Union Minister for social justice is, 

the  Government  should  enhance  the  reservation  percentage  according  to  their 

population.  Based on their population, adequate amount is not allocated for SCSP 

and  TSP  by  the  present  Government.      The  present  Union  Government  has  not 

allocated  as  per  the  population  for  SCSP  and  TSP.    The  Government  may  start 

residential schools for the Scheduled Castes students also.  I would urge upon the 

Central  Government  to  conduct  special  drive  to  fill  up  the  backlog  vacancies 

reserved for SCs/STs.  Scholarships should also be enhanced for Scheduled Caste 

and Scheduled Tribe students
