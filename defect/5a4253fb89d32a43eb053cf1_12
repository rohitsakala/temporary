 I stand here to argue on the Constitution 

(One  Hundred  and  Nineteenth  Amendment)  Bill  2013  on  land  transfer  between 

India  and  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh  was  born  form  our  home  and  the  burden  of 

Bangladeshis is being faced by Asom. Asom has carried this burden for a long time 

particularly  after  the  war  of  1971.  The  demarcated  line  by  Radcliffe  was  drawn 

haphazardly  and  it  has  not  solved  the  border  problem.  Asom  was  against  this 

transfer of 268.39 acres of land. The riverine area is unprotected. The borders are 

porous. The BSF is not able to manage the border as the total length of the border 

is 4096 kilometres. The indigenous organisations of Assam opposed the transfer of 

land to Bangladesh so far as Assam's land is concerned. We had to include Assam 

in  the  land  border  agreement.  We  wanted  total  protection  for  Assam  against 

infiltration. The identity of the Assamese people must be protected. We also want 

the  minorities  in  Bangladesh  who  came  to  India as refugees, the  Hindu  Bengalis, 

the  Chakmas,  the  Hajongs  and  the  Christian  minorities  to  be  protected.  We  must 

ensure  that  minority  religions  of  Bangladesh  are  protected  thoroughly.  It  will 

initiate a new process and a new chapter in the relations between the two countries. 

It will also open a transit route to Agartala, Mizoram and Barak Valley in Assam. 

With these words, I support the Bill.
