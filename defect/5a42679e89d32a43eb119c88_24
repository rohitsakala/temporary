  The  National  Agriculture 

and  Rural  Development  Bank  Bill  has  been  brought  to  the  House.  The  House  is 

discussing the manner to get maximum assistance from NABARD for paving the 

path  of  prosperity  of  the  country.  Farming  should  be  managed  properly  and 

NABARD can play an important role in it. We have to strengthen our agriculture 

through various small schemes and by giving it the status of industry. The farmers 

must  draw  the  benefits of  the  NABARD  and the  credit  inflow  should  be towards 

marginal  and  small  farmers  having  special  focus  on  the  farmers  from  the 

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes communities. 

Horticulture  needs  to  be  promoted  in  the  country.  All  of  us  should  make  united 

efforts to stop the suicides of farmers. There should be coordination between RBI 

and NABARD. Despite the focus on White Revolution, the Milk Production in the 

country  is  gradually  declining.  People  in  the  rural  areas  are  leaving  animal 

husbandry. There is no system to earn daily bread, no system for irrigation and also 

no provision for getting loan from NABARD. The country has not seen Achhe Din 

since the last three and half year.
