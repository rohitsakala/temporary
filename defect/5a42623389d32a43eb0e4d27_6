 Child labour is the manifestation of 

abject  poverty.    Majority  of  the  child  labour  comes  from  poor  families  and  they 

have  to  work  to  sustain  themselves.    According  to  the  Government,  there  are  43 

lakh  adolescent  labour  in  the  country.    However, the World  Labour  Organization 

says  that  there  are  about  5  crore  adolescent  labour  in  our  country.    According  to 

my own assessment, there are more than one lakh adolescent labour in Delhi alone.  

The parents have to send their children for work owing to poverty.   There should 

be  provision  for  child/adolescent  labour  and  children  of  poor  families  in  the 

Government schemes. In this Bill, the definition of family is quite dangerous.  In 

the context of a child in this Bill, family means his or her parents, brother, sister, 

brother  and  sister  of  father  and  brother  and  sister  of  mother.    This  is  absolutely 

wrong.  Family means parents and real brother and sister only.  I would, therefore, 

request  the  Government  to  define  the  family  in  clear  terms.    After  getting 

education,  the  child  could  have  the  family  in  the  business,  the  business  should 

therefore be defined so that the life of child is not spoiled.  This Bill cannot serve 

its  intended  purpose  if  it  is  based  on  one  department  only.  Hon.  Minister  should 

take into his cognizance the suggestions made by the Parliamentary Committee.  I 

feel that we need a comprehensive Bill to fully abolish the child labour.
