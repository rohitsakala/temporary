 Though I support this Bill, my point which 

I want the hon. Minister to consider is that in this particular Bill there is no clear 

mention about the drug rehabilitation centre.  This Bill is completely silent on care 

of  persons  with  mental  illness  in  the  community.    My  suggestion  is  that  a 

provision  of  psychiatrist  or  a  clinical  psychologist,  at  all  primary  healthcare 

centres, should be made.  Another  point is the process of licence.  I urge upon the 

Government to consider this whole insistence on having a licence?  Let me remind 

the  hon.  Minister  that  these  advanced  directives  will  be  counter-productive  and 

this  will  lead  to  many  issues.    Coming  to  the  nominative  representative,  the  Bill 

needs  to  make  provision  that  at  least  one  member  needs  to  be  present  with  the 

patient during the in-patient treatment.  It is not required that the judiciary should 

be  part  of  this  Mental  Health  Review  Board.    My  suggestion  would  be  that  this 

Board  should  comprise  of  independent  psychiatrists,  family  care  givers  and 

recovered  patients.    I  propose  to  create  a  Board  of  Visitors  at  each  hospital.    As 

regards right to confidentiality, my suggestion is that this information should only 

be given to the family members and that too in verbal form.
