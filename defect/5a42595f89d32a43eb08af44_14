  I  do  not  want  to  criticize  the  intention  of  the 

Government.  But if the banks have got so many NPAs and if the same is not being 

paid, then they cannot move ahead.  Here, the statistics give us a very clear picture 

as to how banks are being used by the corporate sector.  The public sector banks, at 

present, have almost given Rs.4,87,522 crore to the corporate sector.   The SBT is 

the  treasury  of  Kerala  for  the  past  so  many  years.    Now,  when  the  SBT  is 

amalgamated with the SBI, the problem is that the SBI has got the greatest number 

of  defaulters  of  the  corporate  sector.    The  entire  amount  of  SBT  will  go  to 

corporate.  So,  the  amalgamation  of  the  SBT  and  the  SBI  should  not  happen.    I 

would  finally  appeal  to  the  Government  in  the  name  of  the  SARFAESI  Act  to 

desist from taking these steps.   The hon. Minister of State for Finance may see as 

to why you are engaging some companies to extract money from the people.  They 

attach  their  properties.    They  threaten  them.  Even  the  High  Court  of  Kerala  has 

said  that  this  is  a  wrong  practice;  banks  shall  not  use  such  coercive  means  to 

extract  money.    I  come  from  a  very  poor  area  of  my  State, that  is  Wayanad.  If  a 

loan  of  Rs.50,000  or  Rs.1  lakh  is  outstanding  against  small  farmers,  their  houses 

are attached under the SARFAESI Act.  But, strict actions are not taken against the 

corporate house to recover loan.
