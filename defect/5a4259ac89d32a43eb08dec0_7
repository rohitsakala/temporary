  There  is  a  legislative  vacuum  in 

respect of the statistical matters in the Union List or Concurrent List applicable to 

Jammu and Kashmir.  So, this amendment has been brought to remove the existing 

legislative  vacuum.    But  to  say  that  Article  370  is  being  weakened  with  the 

implementation of this Bill is totally baseless. The existing dispensation of Jammu 

and Kashmir deals with the problems of the people of Kashmir valley only but not 

the  problems  of  people  of  Ladakh  and  Jammu.    The  Jammu  and  Ladakh  are 

discriminated  in  respect  of  allocation  of  funds  also.    And,  it  is  because  of  this 

discrimination  that  the  people  of  Ladhak  demand  for  Union  Territory  status  for 

them.   Moreover, special  packages  are  provided to  Kashmir  only  but Jammu  and 

Ladakh are neglected. Even special recruitment drives are launched for the people 

of  Kashmir  but  there  is  no  such  drive  for  the  youth  of  Ladakh  in  spite  of  huge 

unemployment  there.    Finally,  I  would  like  to  say  that  the  Government  should 

ponder over present crisis in the region.
