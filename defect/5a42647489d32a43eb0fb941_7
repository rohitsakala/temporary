  My  first  submission  is  that  the 

region  for  introducing  this  amendment  Bill  is  a  court  judgment.    Nobody  is 

prohibited  from  visiting  a  Gurudwara.    The  one  who  respects  the  dignity  of 

Gurudwara should be allowed to shoulder the responsibility of its management and 

only such persons should be allowed to vote.  The Guruji had said that Khalsa is 

my  reflection.    How  a  person  who  fails  to  posses  the  appearance  of  Khalsa  can 

manage the affairs of Gurudwaras.
