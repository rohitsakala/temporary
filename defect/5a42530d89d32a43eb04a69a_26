 Being a son of a farmer, I feel proud to take 

part in the discussion on agriculture on the floor of the August house. In the recent 

years      agriculture  is  being  considered  as  an  inferior  profession.  Nowadays  the 

mindset of the people has changed due to uncertainties in farming  sector. I would 

like  to  point  out  that  farmers  and  weavers  are  the  two  eyes  of  the  country's 

economy.  The  government  should  treat  them  equally  and  provide  adequate 

opportunities. After the NDA government came to power various welfare measures 

were  taken  up  for  the  overall  development  of  farming  community.  I  am  of  the 

opinion  that  this  is  one  of  the  major  reasons  for  our  farmers  lagging  behind  in 

terms  of  development  as  they  are  not  getting  better  prices  to  their  produces. 

Construction  of  roads,  hospital  for  all  including  senior  citizens,  better  schools, 

potable  water  and  all  other  necessary  amenities  should  be  made  available  to  the 

people  of  the  villages.  With  regard  to  Neem  coated  Urea,  I  would  like  to 

congratulate  our  hon'ble  Minister  Shri  Ananth  Kumar  Ji  for  taking  every  step  to 

ensure  that  the  required  quantity  of  urea  is  made  available  to  every  farmer.  Our 

hon'ble  Prime  Minister  has  set  the  target  to  doubling  the  farmer's  income  in  the 

next five years.
