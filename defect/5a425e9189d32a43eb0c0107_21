  Due  to  lack  of  employment  opportunities  in 

villages most of the population is migrating to nearby cities. They have no facilities 

of water, electricity, sewer and roads.  Government should take care of them.  It is 

the  priority  of  the  government  to  provide  housing  to  a  person.  New  Industrial 

complexes  may  be  developed  alongwith  houses  for  poor  so  that  problems  of 

employment, housing, education etc. are solved simultaneously.  Poverty alleviation 

schemes for the poor needs to be made public friendly.
