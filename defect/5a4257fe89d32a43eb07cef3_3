  At 

the  outset,  I  oppose 

this 

Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of 

High Courts Bill, 2015 which seems to have been drafted in a half-hearted manner.  

A  this  juncture,  I  would  suggest  that  the  Bill  be  referred  to  the  Standing 

Committee, more so since it has not gone through the scrutiny.  I begin to point out 

a  few  mistakes  that  I  have  noticed  in  this  Bill.    I  refer  to  Chapter  13  clause  12 

which  very  clearly  states  that  cases  only  above  Rs.  1  crore  would  be  handled  by 

commercial courts.  How would this change in law affect the work of judges or the 

courts  is  something  that  is  to  be  considered.    It  seems  that  the  Government  is 

actually creating this provision only to help big business.  This specific sum of Rs. 

1 crore seems a little dicey to me.  The Government is not interested in solving the 

problems of those companies which have disputes of value lesser than Rs. 1 crore.  

Section  4  states  that  the  judges  for  these  courts  will  be  appointed  by  the  Chief 

Justice of respective State High Courts.  Why not involve the State Governments 

also?    What  will  be  the  criteria  for  allotment  of  judges  to  a  particular  case?    We 

need more transparency in this matter in order to ensure that justice is served, not 

only served but it should also seem to be served which is of very vital importance 

in  India  today.    Suppose  it  falls  through  in  Lok  Sabha  or  let  us  assume  it  falls 

through  in  Rajya  Sabha.    Then,  your  Ordinance  would  also  lapse.    Some  people 

who  have  jumped  into  the  net  which  you  created  to  protect  them  from  23rd 

October, 2015, till the beginning of this Session which was 26th of November what 

happens  to  them?    Will  they  get  your  benefit  or  will  they  be  deprived  of  the 

benefit?  Who are the companies?
