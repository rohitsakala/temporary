  It  is  a  good  step,  but  I 

agree with an earlier speaker who was telling that it is a colonial decision which we 

have  taken.    Definitely,  it  reduces  the  burden  of  the  High  Court  and  the  litigants 

will also benefit enormously from the point of view of distance, from the point of 

view  of  fees  and  all  other  points  of  view.    But  in  the  long  run,  the  power  of  the 

original jurisdiction of the civil cases may be taken away from the High Court and 

given to the district courts so that the High Court could focus on the appeals and 

writ  jurisdiction.    The  pecuniary  jurisdiction  should  be  uniform  throughout  the 

country.    While  the  property  appreciation  and  currency  devaluation  is  uniform 

throughout  the  country,  raising  it  in  the  case  of  Delhi  High  Court  only  would  be 

unfair.
