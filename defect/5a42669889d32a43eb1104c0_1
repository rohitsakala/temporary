  I am really happy that I 

am  speaking  on  a  Bill  which  is  really  for  the  benefit  of  a  vast  majority  of  poor 

workers  of  our  country.    Bonus  in  the  employee's  life  is  very  important  because 

those who get bonus are poor people.  I would like to know whether it should be 

increased  to  Rs.  25,000  or  it  should  be  according  to  the  inflation.    It  has  been 

mentioned,  "seven  thousand  rupees  or  the  minimum  wages".    It  is  also  said  that 

where the employee's pay is more than Rs. 3,500, they are also be in the Rs. 3,500 

bracket.    My  question  is  this:  If  somebody  is  getting  a  payment  of  Rs.  2,000  or 

2,400, what will be the amount they will get?  According to another amendment, 

the  Government  may  come  out  with  some  rules  or  regulations  regarding  these 

things.   But  it  is not clearly  mentioned in the  Bill  as  to  what  sort  of  Government 

regulations will be there.
