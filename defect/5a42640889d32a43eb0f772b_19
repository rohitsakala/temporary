 I fully support this 123rd Constitution 

Amendment  Bill  on  behalf  of  my  party.    I  also  demand  reservation  for  Marathi 

community as well.  People of Maratha Community agitated on the streets.  Silent 

marches were organized months ago without damaging any Government property.  

They are basically from farmer community.  They should be given reservation in 

education  and  employment.    Grave  injustice  has  been  done  to  them.    Hence,  I 

would  like  to  request  the  Government  to  give  reservation  to  the  Maratha 

community as well.
