  I  congratulate  the  hon.  Minister 

for bringing this legislation.  Bonus was once treated as charity or ex gratia.  Now 

it is legally having that status.  Minimum bonus is 8.33 per cent and the maximum 

is limited to 20 per cent.  I would suggest that this maximum limit of 20 per cent 

should  be  substantially  increased.    Unfortunately, human  capital  is  not  taken into 

consideration  properly  in  this  Bill.    Similarly,  in  our  present  Payment  of  Bonus 

Act, there are seven categories which are excluded from the purview of the Act.  I 

would  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  re-examine  that  aspect  also.    At  present, 

workers  are  dismissed  from  service  on  the  ground  of  misconduct  and  as  a  result, 

they  are  disqualified  from  getting  bonus.    So,  that  clause  may  also  be  amended.  

Moreover, structural changes are needed in this regard.
