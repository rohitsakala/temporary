 Education as we know moulds the future of our country.  

The  Government  is going  back  from  spending  in  higher  education.   How  can  we 

achieve this target in 2021, that is, 30 per cent of Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in 

this  country.    If  we  analyze  the  overall  GER,  it  is  18.5  per  cent  for  Scheduled 

Castes  and  13.3  per  cent  for  Scheduled  Tribes  in  2014-2015.    This  social  gap  is 

increasing year after year.  But there is a gap in SC/ST and other socially backward 

sections in engineering education and higher education as a whole.   Under the Act 

the selection of Director is okay but what about the selection of teaching faculty?  

What  is  the  process  of  selection  of  teaching  faculty  in  the  so-called  autonomous 

institutions?    We  have  to  choose  teaching  faculty  on  merit  for  our  institutions  of 

national importance.  What is the status of reservation in these institutes?  Before I 

conclude, I would request the hon. Minister to respond to the issues raised by me.
