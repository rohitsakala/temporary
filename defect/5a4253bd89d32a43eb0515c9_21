  We  sincerely  support  this 

Budget.  But we oppose the defection of people's representatives after having been 

elected on a particular party ticket earlier and later defecting to other parties.  This 

is a very immoral practice.  We have to correct this.  We have a great example of 

hon. Vajpayeeji here.  Had he wished to survive his Government, he would taken 

some MPs from other parties and would have survived and avoided the mid-term 

poll.   But he  never did like  that.   Here, unless  otherwise  we  correct  the  lapses  in 

our  Anti  Defection  Law,  either  it  should  be  a  time-bound  thing.    Within  three 

months,  if  a  person  croses  the  floor,  having  been  elected  on  one  party's  to  other 

party,  either  he  should  on  his  own  resign;  otherwise  he  should  be  disqualified.   

This is high time as acted on it.
