  The object of the Finance Bill 

is  to  give  effect  to  the  financial  proposals  of  the  Central  Government  for  the 

financial  year  2017-18.      However,  I  would  like  to  know  as  to  what  are  the 

distinctive  features  of  this  Bill  away  from  tax  terrorism?    Even  after  introducing 

the  Finance  Bill,  you  are  again  bringing  amendments.    Everything  shows  your 

tentative  approach.    You  are  yourself  proving  that  you  are  suffering  from 

indecision.    Again,  you  slashed  the  cash  transaction  ratio  from  Rs.3  lakh  to  Rs.2 

lakh.  You have made Aadhar mandatory for IT returns and for PAN.  I would only 

like to know whether we have our infrastructure in India ready to link everybody 

with Aadhar.  The Government is imposing Aadhar on the people while it should 

be  optional.    The  loan  of  all  the  farmers  in  India  should  be  waived  off.    This 

Finance  Bill  is  nothing  but  a  reflection  of  despotic  nature  of  the  government 

because  today  the  youth  is  without  employment  and  farmers  do  not  have  any 

waiver for them.
