  I welcome this Bill on behalf of my party.  

This  is  really  a  good  step.    There  are  so  many  cases  pending  in  courts.    This  is 

really a cause of concern for the common man.  This is the reason as to why most 

of the people do not want to go to the courts and get their issues resolved outside 

the courts.  The setting up of commercial courts would certainly give some relief to 

the  people  but  we  will  have  to  appoint  suitable  judges  for  the  purpose  and  they 

should also be provided training in micro economics.  All the judgements of these 

courts should come  within a stipulated time frame.   The Government should also 

think as to how dispose of such a large number of cases pending in our courts.  If 

the Government is really interested to set up commercial courts, they should first 

think as to how to make them attractive for people so that people go there and get 

justice.  Though setting up commercial courts is really good and we welcome that 

really,  we  should  think  how  trained  judges  could  be  appointed  in  commercial 

courts  and  appellate  divisions  of  the  High  Courts  so  that  speedy  justice  is  given.  

What  we  need  more today  is that people should get speedy  justice.   I  would  also 

like  to  know  from  the  hon.  Minister  as  to  what  they  have  thought  of  appointing 

judges in these courts.
