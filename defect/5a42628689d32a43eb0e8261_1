  I strongly oppose the introduction of the Insolvency 

and Bankruptcy Code, 2015.  My first objection is regarding Rule 69.  According 

to Rule 69, the Financial Memorandum should very specifically state the recurring 

and  the  non-recurring  expenditure  to  be  incurred  when  the  Bill  becomes  a  law.  

Unfortunately,  nothing  is  mentioned  in  the  Finance  Memorandum  regarding  the 

expenditure  to  be  incurred  out  of  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  India.    Secondly,  as 

regards Rule 64, the Bill is not published in the Gazette and no advance notice of 

the intention to move the Bill has been given.  In such a circumstance, we received 

the Bill on Saturday.  We were in our constituencies and we could not go through 

the Bill.  The third and very important objection, which I would like to raise here 

that there are 11 Schedules in it.  The Schedules of the Amendment Act are there 

so as to avoid clause by clause discussion.  My fourth objection is with regard to 

notes  to  clauses.    Where  is  the  note  to  clauses  in  respect  of  39  Clauses  of  the 

Companies  Act  of  2013?    This  Bill  is  a  defective  Bill  because  these  39 

amendments  or  clauses  were  incorporated  in  the  Eleventh  Schedule  so  as  to  not 

have  any  'Notes  on  Clauses'  which  means,  indirectly,  evading  the  Parliament  to 

amend the Companies Act and other major statutes.
