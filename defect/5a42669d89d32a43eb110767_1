 We are perhaps going to damage our economy for 

our petty political interests.  The 21st century generation is asking questions from 

us.    We  should  not  be  over  confident  about  our  economy.    US  has  seen  the  sub-

prime  crisis  and  has  been  able  to  come  out  of  it  after  five  years.    Recently, 

economy  of  Greece  also  tanked.    Little  while  ago,  our  hon.  Minister  of  Finance 

was telling that the whole country is looking up to the GST Bill.  Today, NPAs and 

stressed  assets  have  risen  to  17  per  cent.    If  the  banks  try  to  recover  their  loans 

then,  the  companies  try  to  declare  themselves  as  insolvent  and  bankrupt.    In  US, 

the process to declare a company as insolvent is completed within two years time 

period but here in India it goes on upto two generation at least.  Many companies 

are lying closed in Mumbai.  Their assets and their buildings have almost finished.  

A time of 15 to 25 years has elapsed.  This money is of creditors and of workers.  

Ease  of  business  is  policy  of  us  all.    Finally,  I  would  appeal  that  this  is  a  21st 

century  Bill  and  we  all  should  pass  it  unanimously  thereby  taking  the  country 

ahead with a GDP of 8-10 per cent.
