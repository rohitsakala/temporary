    By  making  this  legislation,  we 

are  making  a  very  effective  and  welcome  move.    If  this  Bill  is  passed  and  then 

implemented properly in a time-bound manner, it goes without saying that that will 

revolutionize the transport sector.  It is a safe, cost effective and an environmental 

friendly mode of transport.  There are anxieties to be addressed in this Bill.  Water 

level  and  the  sustainability  are  in  a  dangerous  position.    Even  rivers  are 

disappearing.    We  have  to  be  very  careful  in  handling  this  kind  of  situation.  

Another  anxiety  is  about  the  formalities  in  getting  permission.    I  hope  the 

Government  would  constitute  an  exclusive  Cell  for  this  purpose.    The  subject 

'water' is in the concurrent list.  Hence, the Ministry should take the views of the 

State Government into consideration.  The issue of low lying bridges and structures 

in the rivers is also an important issue and the same may be addressed.
