  Through this  Bill, the  Government 

propose  to  increase  the  number  of  waterways  from  the  present  5  to  106  .    The 

condition of even existing waterways is pathetic and no substantial traffic is taking 

place  through  them.    I  would  like  to  request  the  Government  that  present 

waterways should be inter-connected with the railways, roads and ports which will 

automatically  increase  the  transportation.    The  flow  of  water  in  our  rivers  is 

dependent on nature and the flow of water in them is not constant throughout the 

year.    Without  taking  into  consideration  this  aspect,  the  implementation  of 

waterways transportation seems very difficult.  Even the experts are of the opinion 

that  too  much  expansion  of  waterways  will  result  in  increased  danger  of  water 

pollution because the pollution caused by the emission of water vessels will result 

in  pollution  of  water  bodies.      It  is  very  essential  to  consider  over  these  points 

before we develop our waterways.
