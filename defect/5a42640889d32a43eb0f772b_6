  Certain  communities  in  the  country  were 

suffering  from  extreme  social,  educational  and  economic  backwardness.    Giving 

the  Constitutional  status  to  the  OBC  Commission  is  a  welcome  step.  The 

Government  should  ensure  that  posts  of  Chairman,  Vice-Chairman  and  the 

Members  of  such  commissions  do  not  remain  vacant.    We  give  reservation  to  a 

caste in one State but we are not giving reservation to this same caste in other state. 

Every  state  has  its  own  mechanism  to  decide  the  category  of  castes.    Now, 

according to this Bill, the rights of the states for inclusion or exclusion from SC to 

OBC or from OBC to ST are being taken away by the Centre.  It is a herculean task 

to get a caste includes in or excluded from the list of SC, ST or OBC.  The rights of 

the  states  are  taken  away.    It  is  really  the  question  or  the  basic  principle  of  the 

federal  set  up.    On  that  issue,  I  appeal  the  Government  that  the  clause  has  to  be 

taken away and there should be clarity on this issue.
