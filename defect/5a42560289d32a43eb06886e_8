  Many 

Honourable Members have given suggestions on this Bill.  These suggestions are 

very  good.    The  role  of  our  government  in  this  respect  is  very  limited.    The 

suggestion  is  for  decontrolling  the  sugar  industry.    Previously  it  was  regarding 

controlling.    Many  honourable  members  have  suggested  that  there  should  be  a 

buffer  stock  of  sugar.    This  mean  we  should  go  to  control  system  and  buy  more 

sugar from them.    We have three factors.  First is mill owner, second is sugarcane 

farmer and the third is consumer.  As I  have told before the total of Rs. 260 lakh 

tonnes of sugarcane was sown.  90 lakh tonnes of previous year is left before.  It is 

a total of Rs. 350 lakh tonnes.  Consumption is of only 250 tonnes. Closing stocks 

are rising. We have no role to play in it.  It is up to State Government.  Sugarcane 

farmers  always  sows  sugarcane  crop.    As  long  as  there  is  question  of  rising  of 

sugarcane  and  sugar  prices,  lakhs  of  tonnes  of  sugar  is  lying  in  market  for  sale 

where much dues of sugar is still pending.  If there is rise of 30 paisa or 40 paisa, it 

will not give any benefit.  We have to follow public distribution system.  We have 

to grant subsidy of 18 rupees.  13.50 paisa goes to consumer. The prices may rise 

manifold consumer will get 13 rupees only. People are poor. 67 percent people are 

getting  benefit  of  PDS  system  under  Food  Security  Act.  Tamil  Nadu  will  come 

under  Food  Security  Act.    We  are  trying  our  best  that  our  industries  do  not  get 

rotten,  our  farmer  does  not  get  hit  and  get  remunerative  price  of  product.  Our 

policy is farmer oriented.  His share goes to him straight in bank so that consumer 

is  also  protected.    Our  policy  is  oriented  in  this  direction.  Our  Bill  should  be 

passed. 

The Bill was passed.
