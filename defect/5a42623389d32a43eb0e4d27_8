 I express my disappointment 

on Bill because we were hoping that the amendments which would be brought in 

this Bill, would make the law stronger and protect our children from entering into 

the  child  labour  system.    But  instead,  it  actually  reverses  the  wheel.    The  Bill  is 

also in contrast to the spirit of the Right to Education Act.  The expectation of the 

people does not seem to be meeting at all through this Bill.  The fundamental issue 

is  the  'family  enterprise'  issue.    In  the  name  of  this  provision  child  trafficking  is 

going  to  increase.    This  Bill  disappoints  us  further  by  not  even  mentioning 

hazardous occupations in which adolescence labourers will not be allowed to work.  

Another  important  aspect  is  that  we  want the  work  environment  to  be  safe, clean 

and condition, but nothing is spoken about that in this Bill.  No specific regulations 

have been given for the work place.  This Bill, ultimately, will bring all the female 

children into the child labour system.  This runs in contrast to the slogan of 'Beti 

Bachao  Beti  Padhao'  given  by  the  Government.    I  would  like  to  say  that  the 

exception that the Bill creates about the children under the age of 14 should all be 

completely removed.  Children of this country deserve to go to school and not to 

work.
