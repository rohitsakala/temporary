    In  the  scheme  of  things  of  our 

Constitution, the judiciary has got a independent place.  The High Courts and the 

Supreme  Court  are  not  accessible  to  the  common  people.    In  today's  judicial 

system,  common  man  does not  get  the  justice  when  he  needs  it.   Finally, he  gets 

the  justice  so  delayed  that  his desire  for early  justice is  finished.   Today, there is 

lack  of  even  civic  amenities  in  the  lower  courts  and  it  is  difficult  to  stay  in  the 

court  compound.    Crores  and  lakhs  of  cases  are  pending  today.    There  is  urgent 

need  to  increase  the  number  of  courts  together  with  increasing  the  number  of 

judges.    Unfortunately,  no  advocate  wants  to  become  district  judge.    Therefore 

there is need to make a provision for salaries and pension for judges so that good 

number of advocates feel attracted towards joining as judges.  Introduction of Lok 

Adalats is a good effort and as yielded very encouraging results.  With the increase 

in  population,  the  number  crime  cases  and  criminals  has  also  increased.    The 

interpretation  of  crime  has  also  undergone  a  change.    Those  violating  the  laws 

should be afraid of law.  The rule of law or the fear of law will be established only 

when crime is proved and punished in the court of law.
