  An  hon.  Member  said  that  there  was 

the NPA of Rs. 6,000 crore in the decade of 1990 which has increased to Rs.4.25 

lakh    crore.    The  farmers,  students  and  labourers  are  not  responsible  for  this 

situation but the greater responsibility goes to big industrialists.  If the Government 

is serious, the institutions like DRT should be made operative at the district level 

which should sort out  small cases of loan recovery at village, tehsil or sub-division 

level.  We will not be able to see this into its full implementation unless the central 

registration  system  is  put  in  place  in  this  country.    As  far  as  the  age  limit  of  the 

Members of the tribunal is concerned, their age limit is increased to 62 to 65 or 65 

to 67 and this process continues further.  Today, new talents and new thoughts are 

more  required  to  be  brought  in  our  system  than  just  extending  the  age  limit  of 

retired persons.  I would urge the hon. Finance Minister to bring amendment to this 

provision.  At last, I would urge that the provisions for recovery of loans from the 

small and marginal farmers should also be reconsidered.
