    The practice of bonus payment as a 

periodical payment could be said to have begun during the First World War when 

the  industries  made  huge  profits.    The  Government  of  India  appointed  a  Bonus 

Commission on December 16, 1961.  In one its recommendations, the then Bonus 

Commission said that 60 per cent of the available surplus should be distributed as 

bonus.  But still, this has not been implemented in the case of industries.  This is 

our humble request to the Minister that there should not be any ceiling.
