  I  thank  you  for  giving  me  this 

opportunity  to  express  my  views  on  Election  Laws  (Amendment),  2016.    Voting 

rights should be given to those Bangladeshi citizens who have been living in India 

since  long.    The  Government  should  also  consider  the  condition  of  Bangladeshi 

people living in metro cities on large scale.  Their condition is very much pitiable.  

They  have  no  shelter  and  no  access  to  potable  water.    I  would  urge  upon  the 

Government that apart from voting rights, they should also be provided shelter and 

other facilities.
