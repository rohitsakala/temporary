  Pradhan  Mantri  Awas  Yojana,  Deen  Dayal 

Upadhyay  Antyodaya  Yojana,  National  Urban  Livelihood  Mission,  Rajiv  Awas 

Yojana, JNNURM etc schemes aim at providing housing facilities to the urban poor 

to  make  a  slum  free  India.  Problem  of  urban  housing  is  increasing  day  by  day  in 

Assam. Assam calls for urgent attention of the Ministry. Thousands of poor people 

are facing the problems of acute shortage of dwelling units. I appeal to the Ministry 

to  provide  housing  facilities  to  the  poor  and  needy.  Assam  cannot  afford  to  make 

provisions  of  housing  to  all  its  urban  poor.  I  request  the  Central  Government  to 

make necessary budgetary provisions to provide pucca houses to all our poor people.
