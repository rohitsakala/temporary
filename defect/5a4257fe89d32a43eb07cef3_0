  The  rationale  for  this  legislation  is  the  ever 

increasing  number  of  commercial  disputes  that  crop  up  as  a  result  of  increasing 

economic activity in the country.  It is a fact that there is a huge pendency of high 

value  commercial  disputes,  the  reduction  of  which  is  necessary  to  make  India  a 

desired,  a  more  attractive  and  a  more  favoured  destination  for  investors  to  do 

business  in.    The  quick  adjudication  of  commercial  disputes  would  faster  the 

growth of trade and commerce.   It is a regrettable that some ouf our laws remain 

archaic.  The Civil Procedure Code is of the year 1908.  The need of the laws is to 

evolve with the changing times.  The Subordinate Judiciary is burdened with about 

three crore pending cases.  The main aim of creating the commercial courts is not 

only reduction of the pendency of suits already filed but also to quickly dispose of 

the new cases that would be filed.  Our Party has reservations on two points in the 

Bill.   One  is  with  regard  to the  Specified  Value  as defined  under  Section 2  (1)(i) 

for  a  Commercial  dispute  as  per  this  Section  is  Rs.  1  crore.    We  want  that  to  be 

enhanced to Rs. 10 crore at the least.  Under the provisions of Sections 19 and 20 

of  the  Bill  cast  an  obligation  on  the  State  Government  to  provide  infrastructural 

facilities.    The  Centre  should  provide  substantial  funds  for  the  establishment  of 

these infrastructural facilities.  In order to fulfill the objective of quick disposal of 

pending cases, the vacancies in the judiciary at all levels should be filled up.  The 

quality of the legal education imparted in India is a matter of grave concern.   The 

mushroom growth of substandard law colleges should be curbed.
