  The present Bill seeks to eliminate 

the  shortcomings  being  felt    in  mineral  sector  since  earlier.  The  proposed 

amendments  mainly  address  to  issues  namely  transfer  of  mining  lease  and 

procedural   simplification . Earlier the transfer of Mines which were not allotted 

through  auction  was  not  possible.  The  Government  has  made  the  provision  for 

enabling  the  transfer  of  mines  which  are  acquired  through  the  route  other  than 

captive mining or auction. If we want to make the dream 'Make in India' a reality 

than  we  have  to  remove  obstacles  in  transferring  raw  materials  to  our  industries. 

The  captive  mines  are  associates  with  users  projects  which  are  capital  intensive 

projects and provide employment opportunities. We can neither be mere spectator 

nor  let  the  industry  suffer  on  account  of  procedural  obscurity.  The  Governments 

has simplified the procedure. To me, this will protect the interest of our Financial 

Institutions alongwith attracting investors. We are also trying to save the interest of 

Banks which are custodians of public money.  Whenever, industrial unit other than 

Bank fall sick and the industrialists are unable or hesitate to transfer it to someone 

else than it will remain sick unit. Through the present Amendment we try to revive 

industries by encouraging new entrepreneurs.
