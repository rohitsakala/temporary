 It is a very good law.  I am in favour of this Bill 

but  I  want  to  know  from  the  Minister  of  Finance  who  will  implement  this  law.   

There is a ceiling on land.  Why not put a ceiling on wealth.  If a ceiling is put on 

wealth, money  will be  decentralized.   71 percent  black  money  is there in  parallel 

economy.    About  70,000  cases  involving  Rs.  5  lakh  crores  are  pending  in  DRT.  

My  request  is  that  before  passing  this  Bill  there  should  be  ceiling  on  wealth, 

change in our thoughts, our intentions and there should be no difference in what we 

preach and practice.
