 This Bill prohibits children up to 14 years of age 

from working in any occupation. However, it allows them to work in home based 

work and those working in the audio visual industry. I can only say that we cannot 

change  the  situation  through  legislation  alone.  This  requires  a  huge  amount  of 

social change and movement which can come about if we are able to build a lot of 

awareness. But unfortunately, this Bill does not encompass the IEC provision, that 

is,  the  Information,  Education  and  Communication  aspects.  They  are  not  made 

mandatory. If we make it mandatory for all State Governments it would help us in 

getting  rid  of  child  labour. Then, population  stabilization  is  the  need of  the  hour. 

Finally,  I  would  like  to  say  that  we  also  need  to  ensure  that  the  conviction  rate, 

which is less than 10 per cent, goes up.
