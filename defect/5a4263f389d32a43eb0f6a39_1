   This is 

regarding the compensation awarded in the case of accidents.  I would like to know 

from  the  Government, that  in  case  the  court  awards  a  higher  compensation, as  to 

who will pay the remaining amount, whether the insurance company will pay it or 

the  person  who  has  caused  the  accident  will  pay.    In  cases  of  the  offences 

warranting such penalties that have not been specified in the Bill, it is unreasonable 

to impose penalties without knowing the nature of the offences.  The Minister said 

that  the  Government  will  issue  a  notification.    But  here  we  are  going  to  give 

powers of specifying the offences to the Executive.  So, I want to clarification from 

the Minister on this point.  Moreover, it is unclear as to who will bear the cost of 

implementing the safety measures enumerated in Clause 45 of the Bill.  Under the 

provisions pertaining to the certificate of fitness  of the vehicle, the income of the 

State Government has been taken away and the vehicle owner will have to spend 

extra money at Automated Testing Station.
