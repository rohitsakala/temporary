  The  age  under  the  Child 

Labour Act has been raised from 14 years to 18 years.  I thank you and the concept 

of 'adolescence' has been introduced.  For both the points, we appreciate the hon. 

Minister.  Unless the Right to Education is coupled with the Child Labour Act, the 

purpose would be defeated.  Allowing the child after 14 years and up to 18 years to 

work  in  the  'family  enterprises'  may  not  serve  any  big  purpose.    If  we  want  to 

realize the purpose of the Child Labour Act, then strengthening of infrastructure in 

the Indian transit schools is extremely important.  Incentives for good parents have 

to  be  given  where  they  are  not  allowing  the  child  to  work  and  similarly,  a  mild 

punishment  should  also  be  given  to  parents  if  they  are  caught  for  child  labour.  

Children  from  two  to  six  years  should  also  be  considered  under  the  Labour  Act.  

Unless the inter-departmental  monitoring mechanism  is  evolved, the  Bill  will  not 

serve any purpose.
