    I  would  like  to  know  whether  this 

government  would  consider  the  Muslim  community  as  socially  and  educationally 

backward, not on the basis of religion, but on the basis of empirical data given by 

the Government of India itself.  The second issue I would like to raise is that there 

are two communities named Suljapuri and Kohliya in Seemanchal of Bihar.  The 

population of these communities is 25 lakhs.  I would like to know whether these 

communities will be included in the list of OBCs.  There is a urgent need to evolve 

such  a  mechanism  under  the  proposed  commission  through  which  it  could  be 

decided whether the communities making reasonable advancement would continue 

to remain included in the list of OBCs or will they be excluded from it.  There is a 

need for granting the status of constitutional body to the National Commission for 

Backward  Classes,  National  Commission  for  Women,  National  Commission  for 

Protection of Children right and the National Human Rights Commission.
