  The Factories Act was amended seven times 

during the  last  70  years.   There  is  a  contradiction between the  statement  made  in 

this  Bill  and  the  opinion  of  the  Standing  Committee.   There  are  many  provisions 

which are sought to be amended.  The hon. Minister has chosen to amend only two 

Sections.  That is Section 64 and 65.  Without discussing other clauses amending 

the Sections in the original parent Act, how can we pass this Bill?  The aim of the 

Government 

to 

introduce 

this  Bill 

is 

to  see 

the  enhanced  employment 

opportunities.  I do not understand how by increasing the hours of overtime, they 

can  increase  the  employment  opportunities.    Whereas  the  Standing  Committee  in 

its  Report  has  stated  that  increasing  the  overtime  hours  across  the  factory  would 

certainly  have  an  adverse  impact  on  employment  generation.    So,  there  is  a 

contradiction between the opinion of the Standing Committee and the intention of 

this Bill. So, I would request the hon. Minister to withdraw this Bill and come with 

the  Bill  which  is  already  introduced  in  this  House  which  was  referred  to  the 

Standing Committee.  So, I would request the hon. Minister to withdraw this Bill.
