  We need to solve the problem of rural 

urban migration and how it would affect our housing schemes.  Migration increases 

stress  on  public  infrastructure  in  cities.    There  has  been  a  lack  of  communication 

between state and central representatives regarding SMART CITY.  The Housing for 

All program does not talk about the urban slum dwellers. The government must try 

actively to rehabilitate slum dwellers before it starts executing this project in urban 

areas.    The  government  needs  to  come  up  with  effective  solutions  that  will  reduce 

the  pressure  on  our  cities  and  discourage  migration.    We  need  to  focus  on 

rehabilitating  slum  dwellers  and  to  solve  a  host  of  problems  that  our  cities  face 

today.  India's target should not be to 'Focus' but to diffuse development so that not 

only  urban  concentration  but  instead  rural  life  must  be  offered  on  an  attractive 

platter.  Words such as Rurban must be made a reality by investing and focusing on 

it from now itself.
