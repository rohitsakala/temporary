 Farmer rights groups have claimed that the 

Budget has nothing to  assure better income, nothing  to  lift  them  out of  their debt 

trap, nothing to even compensate for their losses due to demonetization. No clear 

steps taken to increase of farmers. Roadmap of strategies to double farmers income 

especially  of  marginalized  farmers,  was  not  presented  during  the  Union  Budget 

2017-18.  Pradhan  Mantri  Fasal  Bima  Yojana  (PMFBY)  remains  a  big  talk  and 

impossible claims about PMFBY has been quite visible. However there appears to 

ba  a  Bonanza  for  insurance  companies.  Expenditure  on  premium  under  PMFBY 

was increased to Rs. 13.240 crore but covered only 26.5% of farmers during 2016-

17.  All  this  money  went  to  farmers'  claims  were  addressed  in  return.  There  is  a 

decline  in  the  allocation  for  Rshtriya  Krishi  Vikas  Yojana.  The  Long  Term 

Irrigation  Fund  (LTIF)  which  was  set  up  with  NABARD  received  an  additional 

crops fund of Rs. 40,000 crore in Union Budget 2017-18, compared to Rs. 20,000 

crore  in  Union  Budget  2016-17.  But  there  was  no  mention  of  how  much  was 

actually spent and there continues to be no mention of how much will be spent or 

what  irrigation  facilities  will  be  created.  There  is  a  near  complete  silence  in  the 

budget  on  Income  Security  and  Relief  from  Debt  Trap.  Hence  I  oppose  the 

Demands for Grants under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture.
