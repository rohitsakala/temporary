 Children are deprived of their childhood due to 

child labour.  This is a heinous crime.  Children do not undertake child labour on 

their  own  volition,  they  are  forced  into  it.    I  would  like  to  submit  that  these 

problems  have  continued  only  because  efforts  have  not  been  made  till  date  to 

combat  poverty.    It  is  my  submission  that  maximum  efforts  should  be  made  to 

remove  poverty.    It  would  check  child  labour.    Laws  do  exist,  but  if  they  are 

implemented strictly, then only child labour could be removed.  Through this law, 

there would be a check on child labour.
