 I oppose this Bill.  Five smaller banks 

are  being  merged  with  the  big  ocean  called  the  State  Bank  of  India.    The 

Government has already put it into effect.  We are only doing a post-mortem and 

putting  our  stamp  on  it.    It  is  a  clear  move  to  hide  the  immense  amount  of  non-

performing assets that these banks have accumulated over the years.  This seems to 

be  as  stopgap  arrangements  to  prevent  these  five  smaller  banks  from  collapsing 

inwards.    Given  the  horrible  situation  that  exists  today,  by  merging  the  smaller 

banks  with  the  larger  bank,  you  are  trying  to  hide  the  bad  performance  of  the 

banks.  Employees,  who  were  supposed  to  do  due  diligence  and  locate  genuine 

loanees  had  consciously  defaulted.    They,  from  the  chairmen  of  the  banks  to  the 

bank managers, to the assessors of the bank, all have connived at some point or the 

other  to  give  out  bad  loans,  whether  it  is  to  big  corporations  or  to  companies  or 

corporate.    My  positive  suggestion  to  the  Government  would  be  that  a  time  has 

come when you have to weed out the corrupt and the inefficient from the system.  

So, let us take steps to create a situation where we do not tax the tax-payers even 

more  into  paying  for  the  faults  of  these  politicians,  these  bureaucrats  and  these 

banks  employees.  Now,  if  these  banks  fail,  there  will  be  no  recourse  for  this 

country, there will be no resource for the poor man.
