  I  support  the  Bill  while  opposing  the  fees 

hike because the students from poor families will not be able to afford it.  There is 

a  need  to  sanction  one  IIT  each  for  Karimganj  of  Barak  Valley,  Brahmaputra 

Valley, and any of three places of Nagaon, Barpeta and Dhubri.  I also request one 

IIT  each  for  the  six  North-Eastern  States.    If  proper  facilities  are  given  to  the 

students of the North-East, they can also excel in the field of  science.  There is a 

need  to  improve  the  quality  of  education.    We  know  that  some  of  the  people 

running  NASA  are  from  India.    We  should  make  our  environment  conducive 

enough so that our students do not have to go outside.
