  I  would  like  to  place  on  record  the  thanks  of 

our state for announcing nine out of the eleven institutions that were mandated in 

the AP Reorganization Act.  We are waiting just on the Central University and the 

Tribal University to complete the obligation.  Our hon. Chief Minister of Andhra 

Pradesh aims to make Tirupati a major knowledge hub of the State.  The House is 

aware that our Chief Minister has a vision and resolve to make Andhra Pradesh as 

Swarnandhara Pradesh.  IIT Tirupati has issued an advertisement for recruitment of 

Assistant Professors, Associate Professors and Professors.  But the surprising thing 

is that government are recruiting them on contract or deputation basis.  Why are we 

are  recruiting  them  on  contract  or  deputation  basis.    Why  we  are  not  recruiting 

them on regular basis?  I would request the hon. Minister to have a regular Director 

for  Tirupati  as  early  as  possible.    What  efforts  the  Ministry  is  going  to  take  to 

improve  the  standing  of  Indian  universities  at  the  international  level?    I  am  sure 

that  if  we  provide  these  opportunities,  we  would  not  have  this  brain  drain,  and 

students  would  stay  back  and  do  the  research.    More  than  2000  students  have 

dropped out from IITs in the last three years alone.  What are the reasons behind 

this?  I, request the hon. Minister to quicken the process of construction of the new 

building  for  IIT,  Tirupati  by  allocating  sufficient  funds  and  to  complete  it  well 

before 2019.
