  On  behalf  of  our  State 

Government,  I  convey  my  sincere  thanks  to  the  hon.  Minister  because  he  has 

sanctioned 1,93,000 houses to  our state.  Adequate  funds  have  been  sanctioned  for 

various other schemes.  In the cities, the major problem is housing especially for the 

poor  and  slum  dwellers.    Thousands  of  houses  are  vacant  because  of  lack  of 

infrastructure.    Instead  of  constructing  crores  of  houses  in  the  outskirts  of  cities,  if 

you  construct  limited  number  of  houses  in  the  heart  of  cities  with  lift  and  other 

facilities they can take advantage of that.  The Government should have a standard 

policy on urbanization.  Poverty and drought in the rural areas are the main cause of 

migration  of  people  to  urban  areas.    So,  the  Government  should  try  to  provide 

employment  in  the  rural  areas.    We  have  to  decentralize  the  facilities.    The 

Government  should  give  some  concessions  and  encouragement  to  people  who  are 

starting  industries  or  hospitals  or  educational  institutions  in  the  rural  areas.    The 

Government  is  spending  crores  of  rupees  through  various  schemes. 

  But 

unfortunately many of our Members are not having any say in the implementation of 

these  schemes.    So,  the  Government  should  look  into  this  issue  so  that  the 

Government can implement these schemes very effectively.
