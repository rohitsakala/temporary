 Poverty alleviation could be achieved by providing 

appropriate skill development programmes and more jobs can be generated through 

self-employment  schemes.  Now,  Mudra  bank  loan  is  provided  to  help  the  job 

seekers to start their own business ventures, small or big. Orientation/training has to 

be imparted to different strata of society, especially in the lower range of the society 

to  familiarise  them  with  numerous  possibilities  for  self-employment.  Unless  and 

until we address the issue of poverty at the grass root level, the country would not be 

able  to  bring  progress  and  development  to  all.  We  are  lagging  behind  in  the 

upliftment  of  the  poor  which  is  why  we  expect  a  quantum  jump  in  poverty 

alleviation schemes.
