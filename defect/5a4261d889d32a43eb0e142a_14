 I would like to extend special thanks 

to  the  hon. Minister  for  bringing  a  Bill  for  taking  care of  such  persons  that  have 

none to take care of them.  The number of persons suffering from mental disorders 

is  increasing  day  by  day.  The  increasing  number  of  mental  patients  can  be 

attributed  to  a  number  of  factors  but  the  facility  of  mobile  and  internet  is  also 

responsible  for  the  situation.    Moreover,  no  criminal  cases  should  be  registered 

against those who attempts to commit suicide due to mental tension.  I would like 

to  request  the  Minister  to  set  up  hospitals  in  every  state  and  doctors  should  be 

deployed  therein.    The  facility  of  insurance  cover  should  also  be  provided  to  the 

mental patients so that there may be an improvement in their lives.
