  187  crore  people  of  our  country  do  not  have 

houses  in  the  urban  areas  as  on  date.    Similarly,  six  crore  people  are  not  having 

houses in the country, in rural as well urban areas.  The Prime Minister had made a 

promise  of  providing  pucca  houses  to  each  family  in  India  by  2022.    In  fact,  the 

government will not bear the entire cost of house but will provide assistance.  More 

budget  is  required  for  all  this.    At  the  same  time,  the  urban  local  bodies  should 

construct  houses  in  the  prescribed  time  frame.    They  do  not  complete  their  work 

during  the  prescribed    time  frame  and  in  consequence  of  which  the  Centre  comes 

under flak for the non-utilitilisation of funds.  Rajasthan is also a backward state and 

hence it should be provided substantial budgetary allocation for housing.
