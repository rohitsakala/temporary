  I  have  raised  objections  regarding  the 

procedural matters.  I would like to know from the hon. Minister by having these 

three  schedules  and  three  types  of  education    and  what  is  the  difference  among 

these three types of education.  The higher education is facing so many challenges.  

Low rate of enrolment, unequal access, poor quality of infrastructure, poor quality 

of education and the lack of relevance are few to name.  According to the National 

Knowledge Commission, we are having only 722 universities in India though we 

are required to have 1500 universities.  I request the Government that in the name 

of  research  and  innovation  they  should  not  forget  the  significance  of  imparting 

education.    The  number  of  graduate  and  post-graduate  institutes  should  be 

increased so as to give required significance to imparting education.  If you are not 

able  to  address  the  disparity  in  higher  education,  the  poor,  downtrodden  and 

working  class  people  of  this  country  will  be  deprived  of  the  right  to  have  best 

education.  This will be creating big problems in the country.  Between 1996 and 

2008,  the  private  institutions  expanded  but  at  the  same  time  there  has  been  a 

corresponding decline in the government and government aided institutions.  First 

of all, the public and private aided institutions must be strengthened and expanded 

and  the  expansion  of  self-financing  private  institutions  must  be  restricted  to  a 

reasonable level.  Physical infrastructure, academic reform and ensuring adequate 

faculty is the need of the hour in order to upgrade the excellence and the standard 

of higher education in our country.  Let the Indian universities have collaboration 

with the foreign universities so that Indian students will be getting an opportunity 

to have best education.  The structure of the UGC has to be revised in toto.
