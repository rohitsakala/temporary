  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  hon. 

Minister  for  making  good  suggestions  on this  Bill  and  introducing  good  schemes 

therein  and  for  taking  care  of  the  rural  people.    But,  I  think  something  more  is 

required to be done in this direction so that banks can be useful instruments for the 

large number of farmers.  When the rural people approach the banks of NABARD, 

they are harassed and not treated properly because of being uneducated by the bank 

officials.    Hence,  the  very  objectives  of  setting  up  such  banks  stand  defeated.    I 

hope that such issues will be properly looked into by the Government.  I would like 

to extend thanks to the hon. Prime Minister for providing a package of Rs.250-300 

crore to Assam.  But this amount is very scant.  Farms and land are devastated by 

the  flood  and land  erosion.  So, the  farmers should be provided  interest  free  loan 

and the same should also be waived off, if such a situation arises.
