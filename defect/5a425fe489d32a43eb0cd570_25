 There is a proposal to include certain castes of 

five  states  in  the  list  of  Scheduled  Castes  through  this  Bill.    Hindu  Banjara,  Bot, 

Gurchhiya and Rai Sikh castes of Uttar Pradesh are a fit case for being included in 

this  list.    But  the  State  Government  is  not  recommending  to  the  Centre  in  their 

favour.  I believe that procedure should be amended in this regard that if the State 

Government does not send its recommendation in a time bound manner, the Union 

government,  even  without  the  recommendation  of  the  State,  will  include  these 

castes in the list of Scheduled Castes.
