    Amendment  Bill  2016  is  being 

discussed.  This  Act  was  enforced  in  the  year  1948  for  the  first  time.  Afterwards, 

amendments were brought about in 1949, 1950, 1951, 1954 & 1970.  Last time the 

Amendment was made in the year 1987, however, under the present circumstances 

and with the advent of new technology as well as on the recommendations of the 

International  Labour  Organization  and  other  Committees  this  proposal  was 

introduced  in  the  form  of  a  Bill  on  7th  August  2014.  Later  on  it  was  sent  to  the 

Standing Committee. Hon. Khargeji has also opposed it. I also want to tell the hon. 

Minister that only Sections 64 & 65 have been brought for amendment in case of 

making provision of overtime for increasing the working hours of the labourers. A 

little more time should have been given to the said Bill and after sending it to the 

Committee,  it  should  have  been  discussed  there.  Labour  organizations  have  also 

opposed it at several places.  Therefore, I also oppose this Bill and simultaneously 

I want to give a piece of advice to withdraw this Bill and it should be sent to the 

Standing Committee.  Such misinformation has been spread in the whole country 

that the industrialists are behind the introduction of this Bill. The leaders of Labour 

Unions  have  sent  letters  to  us  and  tried  to  make  several  efforts  to  meet  the  Hon. 

Minister.  Thus,  there  is  a  need  for  seeking  suggestion  from  the  Standing 

Committee after sending the said Bill to the Committee.
