  The  letting  of  loans  and  their  recovery  are 

equally important. This amendment is mainly for enabling the system of recovery 

of  loans,  especially  of  bad  debts.    The  system  is  being  misused.    In  educational 

loans,  the  Stat  Bank  of  India  has  sold  its  loans  to  Reliance  which  is  an  asset 

reconstruction  company  and  Reliance  is  taking  steps  to  recover  loans  from  poor 

students  who  are  not  in  a  position  to  find  employment  after  their  education.    I 

would  like  to  know  from  the  Minister  whether  the  agricultural  properties  are 

exempted from the purview of this Bill.
