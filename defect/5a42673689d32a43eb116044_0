 No doubt, the Bill has dealt with all 

vital issues comprehensive.  But I would like the hon. Minister to give a fresh look 

into  the  following  aspects  of  the  Bill.    Sub-section  3  of  Section  3  needs  certain 

clarity in defining the constitution of the Bureau and the Governing Council.  Sub-

section  3(e)  of  Section  3  empowers  the  Central  Government  to  appoint  such 

number  of  other  persons  representing  Government,  industries,  scientific  and 

research  institutions,  consumers,  etc.  there  should  be  cap  on  the  total  number  of 

Members  so  appointed  by  the  Government.    It  is  also  not  clear  whether  the 

Governing  Council  is  a  permanent  body  or  subject  to  dissolution.    Similarly, 

Clause  5  of  the  Bill  gives  unbridled  powers  to  the  Executive  to  constitute  any 

number of committees for any purpose.  There should be a cap on the number of 

committees  to  be  established.    Levy  of  fees  for  preferring  appeal  is  unfair  and  is 

not  customer  friendly.    I  would  also  like  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  the  hon. 

Minister  that  there  are  two  issues  which  we  have  to  handle.    One  is  about  the 

misguiding advertisements which are cheating the consumers.  The advertisements 

of health foods are coming in the newspapers.  I think the advertisements of health 

foods  have  come  to  a  stage  that  even  the  mother  are  switching  over  from  breast 

feeding  to  ready-made  food.    So,  this  is  something  where  we  have  to  be  serious.  

Then  the  advertisements  come  regarding  the  cosmetic  items  that  if  you  use  a 

particular  hair  oil,  your  hair  will  grow  well.    People  are  being  cheated.    We  had 

constituted another Committee regarding wastage of food.  Food is being wasted.  

So, at these are some of the issues.  So, the issues should be followed up.
