  The  Child  Labour  (Prohibition  and 

Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2012 is one of the most ill prepared Bill that I have 

seen in my seven years in Parliament.  This Bill neither prohibits child labour nor 

does  it  regulate  child  labour.    By  allowing  Clause  5,  the  Government  is  actually 

legitimizing the use of child labour albeit in a manner of family enterprises.   The 

use of 'family' has also been expanded.  By allowing this provision the Government 

have  now  blocked  the  hands  of  civil  society  from  acting  on  saving  children  who 

are  forced  into  labour.    There  is  no  clause  which  regulates  the  working 

environment.  We are saying the family which has been forced to send his children 

to some work needs to be punished.  The fact is that they do not have the money to 

begin  with  and  that  is  the  reason  they  are  forcing  their  children  to  work  whether 

hazardous or not.  If the Government take  fine from them, if you put the father, the 

earning member in jail, the Government think the children will stop working?  Do 

not  be  in  a  hurry  to  pass  this  Bill.  Do  not  reduce  the  list  of  hazardous  industries 

from 83 to 3. Follow the norms of the ILO.  Send this Bill to a Select Committee.  

Let  the  House  examine  it  correctly.  Let  there  be  a  wider  consultation  in  this 

process.
