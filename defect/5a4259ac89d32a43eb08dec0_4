  There  was  an  office  for  data 

collection in Kodarma of Jharkhand which has been shifted to Kolkata recently.  In 

its wake, a number of problems of different sorts have arisen here.  I would like to 

request the hon. Minister to bring this Office again to Jharkhand from Kolkata so 

that whatever inconveniences are there with regard to data, could be solved.
