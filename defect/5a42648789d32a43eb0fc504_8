 Almost all the members are of one opinion to pass 

this Bill.  The availability of wheat, rice, sugar and milk in plenty is only because 

of  this  bio-technology.    No  country  can  survive  without  technology.    If  we 

continue  to  work  on  technology,  we  will  keep  on  producing  more  and  more 

foodgrains,  vegetables,  fruits  and  milk.    If  we  do  not  pay  attention  towards  the 

quality  of  the  production,  we  will  not  be  able  to  do  any  good  to  ourselves  even 

after  the  huge  quantity  of  production.    Uttar  Pradesh  is  the  largest  state  of  the 

country but there is only one park in the name of bio-technology in Lucknow. To 

what extent justice has been done to it?  You are requested to take care of it.  The 

attention  is  required  to  be  paid  to  the  quality  of  education  being  provided  in  the 

private  institutions  of  bio-technology  of  our  country.    We  start  comparing 

everything  to  that  of  China.    But  the  democratic  ideology  does  not  prevail  there.  

India  is  a  democratic  country.    So  we  have  our  limitation  in  this  democratic 

country  as  far as the way  of  our  functioning is  concerned.  We  must  be  proud  of 

our  self-reliance  which  we  have  achieved  in  every  area.    It  is  imperative  to  take 

care  of  the  quality  of  what  we  are  producing  alongwith  the  attainment  of  self-

reliance.    A  good  balance  can  be  achieved  if  we  develop  technology  without 

tinkering with nature.
