  In  the  previous  three  years  a  lot 

has been done regarding research on seeds.  New varieties have been produced for 

paddy as well as Moong Dal.  In all the districts in our State cancer is increasing 

alarmingly,  as  chemical  fertilizers  and  insecticides  are  used  indiscriminately.  

Organic  farming  should  be  promoted  and  there  should  be  research  in  this  regard.  

When  the  new  onion  crops  are  coming  its  rate  has  fallen  to  four  rupees  a  kg.  

Arrangement should be made for storage and purchase of onion.  In my Lok Sabha 

constituency Amla is produced in abundance in Chomu.  A project should be set up 

there to benefit the farmers.  I request the hon. Minister to pay special attention on 

research on indigenous variety as also there should be research on crops requiring 

less irrigation in dry land areas.  I express my immense gratitude to the hon. Prime 

Minister  and  the  hon.  Minister  for  providing  a  budget  regarding  rearing  of 

indigenous cows.
