  The Bill seeks to include Sualgiri and Swalgiri 

castes in the Scheduled Castes List of Odisha.  These communities were found to 

be synonymous with Sabakhia caste which is already included in the List.  Persons 

belong  to  Swalgiri  caste  were  not  getting  benefits  due  to  them  and  the  Odisha 

Government had proposed their inclusion in the Scheduled Caste List.  In India we 

pay  very  little  attention  to  primary  education.    Our  primary  education  system  is 

getting worse.  This is happening despite implementing the Right to Education Act 

and  providing  universal  education  in  the  country.    The  problem  of  enrollment 

might  have  been  solved  but  the  problem  of  bad  quality  of  teaching  remains  and 

plagues  our  society.    I  urge  the  government  to  have  targeted  programmes  to 

improve  the  quality  of  education  given  especially  to  this  section  of  society  i.e. 

SC/STs of them even cannot afford to go to private school.
