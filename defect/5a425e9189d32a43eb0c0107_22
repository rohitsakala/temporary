  In this year's Budget it shows that 176 

per  cent  amount  has  been  increased.    But  in  real  terms,  in  the  case  of  revised 

estimates or actual expenditure, the money has been decreased.   In the year 2009-

10, actual utilization was 68 per cent, in 2010-11, it was 96 per cent and in 2011-12, 

it  was  86  per  cent.    But  in  the  year  2014-15,  the  expenditure  of  the  Ministry  had 

decreased to 45 per cent.  Under the Central Assistance to Rajiv Awas Yojana, it has 

been  shown  that  in  the  case  of  the  North  Eastern  Region  and  also  for  the  Special 

Category  State,  it  is  only  80  per  cent  of  the  project  cost.    My  demand  to  the  hon. 

Minister  is  that  in  the  case  of  the  North  Eastern  Region  and  also  for  the  earlier 

Special  Category  States,  this  ratio  should  be  90:10.    Actual  allocation  under  the 

Prime  Minister  Awas  Yojana  (Urban)  and  the  National  Urban  Livelihood  Mission 

have  decreased.    The  Government  should  release  funds  for  housing  projects  under 

RAY for Kumarghat, Khowai, Sabroom and Amarpur of the State of Tripura.  There 

is a  need  to provide funds  for slum  housing  at  Dharmanagar, Tripura under 10 per 

cent lump sum.  There is also a need to provide funds for Town Halls at Belonia and 

Sonamura, Tripura under 10 per cent lump sum.  There is a need to conform to the 

funding pattern for Smart City Mission as declared by the Finance Ministry Circular 

as 90:10 for North East States in general and for Tripura in particular.
