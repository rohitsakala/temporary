 It is estimated that the country would need 

approximately  2  crore  housing  units  by  the  year  2022.  Approximately  38  per  cent 

people live in slums in the cities with population of 10 lakh and above.  I presume 

that  UPA  Government  also  tried  to  solve  this  problem  but  their  efforts  fetched  no 

result and the schemes could not perform well.  The NDA government is increasing 

allocation for the schemes.  HUDCO and NHB are the nodal agencies.  They have 

entered into MOUs with 177 primary landing institutions but loaning for poor people 

is successively going down as the banks do not advance loans to them.  I request the 

Government  to  include  this  in  the  key  performance  indicators  of  the  banks.    At 

several  places  circle  rates  are  higher  than  market  rates.    This  leads  to  unnecessary 

increase  in  prices.    This  Government  is  concerned  for  the  poor  as  well  as  farmers 

with a holistic approach.  I think all should support the holistic approach.
