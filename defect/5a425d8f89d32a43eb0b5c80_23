  I  rise  to  oppose  this  Bill  for  four  reasons.    The 

first reason is father technical.  On 22nd February, 2017, the amalgamation of all 

the banks has been done by issuing various orders.  This is an infringement on the 

rights of the entire House.  Second is the result amalgamation of all State Banks is 

closing down of branches in the rural as well as the unbanked areas.  For example, 

in  Kerala, the  branches  of  the  State  Bank  of  Travancore  have been  closed  on  the 

basis of this amalgamation.  The second aspect is service charge.  For the purpose 

of increasing profitability, the banks are imposing more service charges.  The other 

aspect  is  about  lending  to  the  primary  sectors,  especially  the  agriculture  sector.  

The  banks  are  not  providing  loans  to  the  farmers.    The  government  has  done  a 

laudable work in terms of social security measures and mudra loans.  But the banks 

are not giving loans to the MUDRA Banks also.
