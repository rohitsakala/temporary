  The children are to be held 

less responsible for crimes and the society is more responsible.  There are several 

reasons for this.  Heinous crimes like rape are not only condemnable but sad and 

very dangerous whatever be the rape of the perpetrator.  Knowledge and culture is 

imparted  by  the  parents.   We  are  not  being  able  to  educate  the  children, they  are 

not being given the light of knowledge, they are in the dark.  If the children remain 

in the dark they will go astray and pick up wrong habits and lead to several sad and 

dangerous  incidents.    Regarding  bad  habits  Gandhi  Ji  said  if  alcohol  is  sold  near 

the  villages  and  around  the  schools  then  the  future  of  the  children  will  not  be 

bright.  Attention also needs to be paid on education, health, disease, exploitation 

and oppression.  Poor should not be subjected to excesses.  The practice of dowry 

and  that  of  child  marriage  should  come  to  an  end.    Due  to  hunger  and  lack  of 

knowledge  children are  going  astray.   We  have  to  pay  attention  to  economic  and 

social well being of the children end, feudal exploitation, police brutality.  Orphans 

should be treated well, they should be provided housing and employment.  We all 

have to work together to make a better India.
