  We  all  know  that  the  prices  of  essential 

commodities,  such  as  rice,  wheat,  pulses,  vegetables,  sugar  etc.  has  skyrocketed.  

According  to  the  latest  study  undertaken  by  ASSOCHAM,  in  the  last  two  years, 

the  prices  of  essential  commodities  have  gone  up  nearly  72  percent  and  on  the 

contrary, the per capita income have gone up by only 38 percent of average Indian 

in metros. 

I  would  like  to  state  that  the  demand  as  well  as  supply,  both  factors 

are responsible for rise in prices of essential commodities.  Apart from increasing 

population  is  itself  a  major  cause  of  rising  demand  and  changing  food  habits  are 

also  responsible  for  increasing  inflation.    Lack  of  warehousing  facilities,  cold 

storage  also  results  in  the  post  harvest  losses  which  also  contribute  to  the  short 

supply of food crops.  Petroleum products, pulses, fertilizers are either imported or 

are  produced  with  imported  intermediate  goods  and  prices  of  such  commodities 

depends  on  the  international  prices.    The  inflation  can  be  controlled  to  a  large 

extent  if  the  government  gives  full  freedom  to  farmers  to  sell  their  agricultural 

produce  anywhere  in  India  without  any  restriction  and  ensure  free  movement 

without taxing the same.  It is my sincere suggestion that the Government should 

focus  upon  comprehensive  reforms,  development  of  agriculture  infrastructure 

reforms,  development  of  agriculture  infrastructure,  elimination  of  hoarders  and 

black  marketers  to  remove  the  artificial  scarcity  plaguing  the  economy  of  the 

country.
