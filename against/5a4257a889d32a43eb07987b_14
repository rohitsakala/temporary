  Today, we are present here to discuss 

the  Factories  Bill,  2016.    On  the  one  hand,  the  Prime  Minister  says  that  the 

Government  will  work  towards  providing  employment  to  more  and  more  young 

people. But here when we are discussing this Bill, we are talking about increasing 

the  overtime.  The  Government  wants  to  increase  the  employment  hours  of  those 

working in the organized sector.  The Government has talked about increasing 50 

hours  duration  to  100  hours  duration  and  has  fixed  the  maximum  period  of 

overtime  to  125  hours.    There  is  no  such  provision  in  the  entire  Bill  which 

indicates  that  the  young  person  doing  overtime  will  get  an  increase in  the  salary.  

The  mention  of  giving  overtime  is  related  to  organized  sector  only  whereas  80% 

people  in  our  country  work  in  the  unorganized  sector.  Factory  Act  applies  to  the 

factory engaging three hundred people. It means that the Government has not made 

any provision of overtime for the factories engaging less people than the figure of 

300.  It is mentioned in the Bill that there was a demand from the industries’ side.  

But  we  do  not  make  any  effort  to  bring  any  Bill  taking  into  consideration  the 

farmers’ demand. Railways never make any provision taking into consideration the 

daily travelers’ demand. The government in a hurry has just carried out the task of 

amending  only  Section  64  and  65  of  the  Factories  Act,  1948.   If  the  government 

goes  on  taking  such  steps,  it  will  lead  to  discouraging  Skill  India  programme, 

MUDRA scheme and other such schemes initiated by the Government.  I oppose 

this Bill and would like to seek clarification from the Hon. Minister in this regard.
