  Through  this  Bill,  definition  of 

custom  area  is  being  extended  in  the  Customs  Act,  1962  wherein  warehouse  is 

being incorporated whereas no custom clearance has been given in this regard.  So, 

there  is  a  need  to  evolve  a  monitoring  mechanism  in  this  regard  otherwise, 

government might suffer.  Secondly, provision of Rs. 100 penalty amount per day 

after  the  lapse  of  30  days  notice  period  has  been  made  in  this  Bill  which  is  very 

less  and  there  is  need  to  increase  it.    I  would  also  like  to  give  suggestion  in  this 

regard that after the receipt of letter, an e-mail should be send after the lapse of 30 

days  and  it  should  also  be  acknowledged.    Provision  have  been  made  in  the 

Custom  Tariffs  Act,  1975  that  levy  might  be  imposed  on  the  imports  to  promote  

and safeguard the indigenous industry which will be against the concept of 'one tax 

one system'.  In addition to that I would also like to request the government to do 

away with the environment tax.
