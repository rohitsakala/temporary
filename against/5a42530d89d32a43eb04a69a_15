 The situation of agriculture in my constituency 

Jaipur, Odisha needs special attention from the Central Government during 2017-

18 and more central allocation is needed for implementation in this district. Farm 

mechanization  needs  more  assistance  in  this  District  so  that  farmers  can  have 

central  subsidy  for  Harvestor  type  machines.  Soil  Test  Centers  need  to  be 

established  in  each  10  block  head  quarters  and  mobile  soil  test  vehicles  should 

reach  far  flung  panchayats  and  tribal/difficult  villages.  Allied  activities  of 

agricultural  sector  need  to  be  boosted  up.  Especially  more  Central  assistance  is 

needed in Fisheries. Central Government should ensure establishment of one cold 

storage  each  in  each  panchayat  head  quarters  so  that  locally  produced  vegetables 

can  be  stored  in  these  for  later  consumption.  Irrigation,  both  surface  and  canal 

irrigation  required  further  central  assistance.  Stress  should  also  be  given  for 

renovation of ponds and traditional water bodies in Jaipur.
