  This  Bill  does  not  take  into  account  the 

demands of Labour Unions. Why the Union Government is resorting to exempting 

clause in the name of uniformity? We donâ€™t want the Government to dictate all the 

State Governments to compel the labourers to work overtime. Prime Minister had 

announced  that    two  Crore people  will  get  jobs  every  year, but  data of  their  own 

department  shows  that  much  less  jobs  have  been  generated  in  the  year  2015. 

Twenty thousand jobs have been lost. The Government must heed to the demands 

of labourers as well  as  industry.
