  The  Bill  is  on  the  lines  of  the  Beijing 

Protocol  and  we  welcome  this  move.    The  Bill  is  laying  more  emphasis  on 

punishing  culprits  and  not  on  prevention  of  crime.    Notwithstanding  having  a 

number of security mechanisms in place we fail to  stop the IC 814 incident.  So, I 

strongly feel that instead of dealing with hijackers and hijack, the Government has 

to  lay  emphasis  on  preventing  hijacking  itself.    Moreover,  I  would  like  to  know 

from the hon. Minister as to what prevented him from including a provision in the 

Bill to shoot down aircraft if it becomes missile heading towards strategic targets 

or  civilian  pockets  or  other 

important  destinations. 

  Finally,  providing 

compensation to all the victims without any discrimination has to be given priority.
