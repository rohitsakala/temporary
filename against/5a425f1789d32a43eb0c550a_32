  A council was set up for GST.  GST has 

been introduced in the House after consensus.  Our Andaman Nicobar islands is 

a consuming state.  We can't contribute anything in GST.  Apart from producing 

Areca nuts  and  spices, we have nothing  any  specific. There is an octroi in our 

Municipal  Council  with  2  per  cent  CST.    One  tax  regime-  GST  has  been 

brought out for the whole country after abolishing corruption.  This is a new law 

for all.  I urge upon the Minister of Finance to say something to compensate the 

deficit  of  Rs.  150  crores  likely  to  accrue  after  implementation  of  GST  to  be 

borne by the Andaman Nicobar Municipal Council, Port Blair.
