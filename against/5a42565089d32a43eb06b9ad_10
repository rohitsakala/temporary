 I think that juveniles need reforms and 

not  prisons  as  has  been  propagated  or  brought  in  the  Bill.    I  would  like  to  touch 

upon  this  Bill  from  two  perspective.    Psychological  and  the  medical  perspectives  

There are several studies where it is mentioned that a child of 16 years of age is not 

capable of comprehending a situation as to what is good or bad for him.  It is very 

much  physiological  and  anatomically  the  child  is  not  developed  enough  to  make 

any judgment for himself to take rational decisions.  Reducing the age from 18 to 

16  years  is  doing  gross  injustice  to  juvenile  population.    It  is  also  against  our 

commitment to UN Convention on child rights.  I oppose this Bill very strongly.  

The discussion was not concluded.
