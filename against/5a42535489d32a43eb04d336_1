  The  point  is,  a  Bill  has  been  passed  by  the  Rajya  Sabha  and 

transmitted to this House and that is pending before this House.  This Bill is titled 

'The  Transgender  Persons  (Protection  of  Rights)  Bill,  2016  and  the  title  of  the 

Private Member Bill is 'The Rights of Transgender Persons, 2014'.  So, these two 

Bills are more or less identical, are of the same nature and of the same character.  

So, that is my formal objection.
