    I  oppose  the  Bill.    There  is  no 

medical  compensation  provided  to  contractual  and  casual  workers  in  factories.  

The amendment should cover the loopholes of the law.  The system of inspectors 

has failed and we need to replace it with a wider civil society  concept.  This is an 

anti  labour  Bill  and  an  industry  friendly  Bill.      Provision  of  safety  for  women 

working at night and canteen facility should be looked after in the factory which is 

the  basic  need  of  the  workers.    The  Government  needs  to  enlarge  the  concept  of 

monitoring and inspection of the system.   I recommend this Bill to be sent to the 

Standing Committee.  A worker who wants to go the court, has to seek permission 

from  the  Government  through  Labour  Commission  which  is  a  very  lengthy 

process.  Is the  Labour Minister thinking anything about it?  The workers' rights 

should not be infringed.
