 Today, we witness such a condition of 

our  Armed  Forces  that  every  Department  has  the  shortage  of  supply  and 

equipment.    The  Defence  Budget  presented  this  year  is  only  2.1  percent  of  the 

GDP.  The rate of farmers' suicide is on the rise year after year.  Aam aadmi is also 

gravely suffering from demonetisation.  A BSF Jawan exposed the quality of food 

and  equipment  given  to  the  Jawans  at  higher  altitudes.    It  seems  that  there  is 

corruption  of  a  very  high  order.    Capital  modernisation  share  was  55  percent  in 

2007-08  and  now  it  is  reduced  to  40  percent  in  the  Budget  of  2017-18.    CAG 

Report clearly mentioned that till 2012, all of 61 Indo-China border roads had to be 

completed  under  the border  road  development  programme, whereas  till  now  only 

22  roads  have  been  completed.    Modernisation  budget  of  Army  and  BRO  is 

reduced.    Where  is  'Make  in  India'?    You  can  see  that  farmers  are  committing 

suicide.  Today the uniformed person gives one proposal and the bureaucrat sitting 

in the office takes another decision.  That is the main reason for our lack of ability 

in Defence.
