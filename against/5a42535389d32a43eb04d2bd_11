  Government  of  India  needs  to  take  some  of 

the important decision in controlling price rise on essential commodities and food 

items.  The  incentives  given  to  exporters  for  exporting  food  items  need  to  be 

completely withdraw and some tax need to be levied. The next thing government 

can  do  is  to  strengthening  PDS  system.  One  of  the  first  decisions  of  the  Hon'ble 

Chief Minister Puratchi Thalaivi Amma on assumption of office in May, 2011 was 

to  announce  and  implement  the  free  supply  of  20  kilograms  of  rice  per  month 

through  the  Public  Distribution  System  to  about  1.83  crore  families  in  the  state. 

Tamil  Nadu's  PDS  is  the  best  functioning  Public  Distribution  System  in  the 

country. Through many such innovative and imaginative schemes, the Government 

of  Tamil  Nadu  under  the  leadership  of  the  Hon'ble  Chief  Minister  Puratchi 

Thalaivi  Amma  has managed to ensure that  the  common  people  in the  state have 

been  protected  against  the  ill-effect  of  price  rise.  At  this  circumstance  what  the 

Government  can  do  now  is  to  import  commodities  from  neighbouring  countries 

and supply through PDS and other distribution system. The people who engaged in 

speculation  and  hoarding  will  immediately  release  the  goods  to  the  market  if  the 

Government remove import duty and reduce domestic taxes.
