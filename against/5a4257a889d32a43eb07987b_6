    This  Bill  will  increase  the  overtime 

hours  in  factories.    Several  Acts  are  passed  but  they  remain  only  in  paper.    In 

several factories extra work is done by the employees but they are not paid for the 

extra  work.    The  decision  of  the  government  regarding  the  working  hours  for 

women  employees  is  welcome.    The  government  should  make  provision  for  PF, 

ESI etc facilities for daily wagers employed in factories.  Interest of employees be 

taken care of putting in extra hours of work regarding their safety, salary and other 

aspects.  There are several factories where employees work for long hours but they 

do not get their agreed salary.  Such companies should be taken to task.   

 

SHRI  MUTHAMSETTI  SRINIVASA  RAO  (AVANTHI):  Indian labour 

laws  are  intrinsically  connected  to  our  freedom  struggle.    The  Factories 

(Amendment)  Bill  is  seen  as  one  of  the  landmark  labour  law  reforms  mooted  by 

the  Government  which  is  keen  to  promote  its  Make  in  India  campaign  to  boost 

domestic  manufacturing.    Manufacturing  is  crucial  for  both  jobs  and  investment 

and  it  is  hamstrung  by  the  archaic  Factories  Act  of  1948.    The  Government 

proposed 54 changes to the Factories Act, 1948, of which the major amendments 

are:-  Provisions  relating  to  imposing  obligation  upon  the  occupier  to  make  a 

provision  of  personal  protective  equipment  for  workers  exposed  to  various 

hazards;  Providing  canteen  facilities  in  factories,  providing  for  shelters  or  rest 

room  and  lunch  rooms  in  respect  of  factories  employing  seventy  five  or  more 

workers  etc.    I  welcome  these  provisions  because  they  are  in  the  interests  of  the 

workers.    The  Andhra  Pradesh  Government,  in  April  2015,  issued  a  Circular 

allowing women to work in factories in night shifts.  I support this Bill.
