  In the  State of Kerala, State  Bank of  Travancore, 

was  performing  well.    But  now  it  has  been  merged.    The  service  of  the  SBI  in 

comparison  to  the  SBT  is  very  poor.    It  is  now  mandatory  for  the  SBI  account 

holders to maintain a balance of Rs. 5,000 in metropolitan areas.  For metro areas, 

if  the  difference  between  the  minimum  balance  and  the  actual  balance  is  50  per 

cent,  then  the  SBI  charges  Rs.  50  plus  service  tax  as  penalty.    If  the  shortfall  is 

more than 75 per cent, the charges are Rs. 100 excluding the  service tax.  People 

with meagre earnings will find it hard to maintain the specified balance.  Thus SBI 

is literally robbing the depositors.  So, I oppose the Bill.
