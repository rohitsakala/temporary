  Let  me  straightaway 

first  preface  by 

acknowledging the fact that the valor and the bravery that have been shown by our 

soldiers  over  the  last  seventy  years  are  next  to  none  in  the  world.    Army  is 

operating with large-scale vintage equipment.  India's Defence budget in 2017-18 

has decreased from 2.4 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 to 2.1 per cent of GDP now.  

The previous Defence Minister's proposal to create a fund which would collect all 

unspent amount from the Defence capital budget from previous years and make a 

corpus  fund  is  an  excellent  idea.    Capital  outlay  used  to  be  33  per  cent  of  the 

Defence  budget  in  earlier  years.    This  has  now  come  down  significantly  to  24 

percent  and that  is  a matter of  great  concern.   Defence  Procurement  Procedure  is 

yet to be given a final shape.  'Make in India' initiative in Defence sector appears to 

have borne no fruit so far at all.  The Minister Shri Jaitely has to unlock the FDI 

logjam in Defence sector.  Regarding OROP I do not understand as to why for nine 

months, only Rs. 3000 crore has been spent.  I would urge the Defence Ministry to 

arm  our  soldiers,  give  them  what  they  need  because  there  is  no  dearth,  of  their 

valour and bravery.
