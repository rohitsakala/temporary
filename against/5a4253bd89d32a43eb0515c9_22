  When  it  comes  to  the  Uttarakhand 

issue,  as  per  the  rules  and  regulations,  if  the  Government  did  not  have  proper 

MLAs, there should have been a floor test.  In the floor test, if it had been proved 

that they were short of MLAs, automatically the Government would have fallen.  I 

do  not  understand  why  BJP  was  in  such  a  hurry  to  impose  President's  Rule  in 

Uttarakhand.  So, unnecessarily using Article 356 is not good for democracy.  We 

have our rules and regulations in the Assemblies as well as in the Parliament.  So, I 

request that the State should be allowed to run properly.
