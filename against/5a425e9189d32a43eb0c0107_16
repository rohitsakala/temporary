  The  Action  Plan  in  this  regard  must  be 

prepared  with  the  active  involvement  of  all  stakeholders.  It  has  been  observed  that 

the  actual  expenditure  by  the  Ministry  has  consistently  been  lower  than  budget 

estimates. Currently, under PMAY, a beneficiary family that will be eligible for the 

central assistance is one that belong to the EWS or LIG category, and does not own 

a pucca house. A household with an income of up to Rs. Three lakh may have two, 

six,  or  even  more  number  of  members.  However,  under  PMAY-U    a  two  member 

household earning Rs. Three lakh annually will be eligible for the same amount of 

subsidy as a six member household earning the same amount. In terms of the size of 

the house, the requirement of a six member household will be higher than that of a 

two    members  household.  However,  they  both  may  end  up  getting  a  house  of  the 

same  size.  The  quality  of  housing  stock  in  slums  is  extremely  poor.  In  order  to 

improve  the  quality  of  life  in  urban  areas,  it  is  of  critical  significance  that  the 

housing  stock  is  improved  through  urban  renewal  in  situ  slum  improvement  and 

development of new housing stock in existing cities as well as new townships.
