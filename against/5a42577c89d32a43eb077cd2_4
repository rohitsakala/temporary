  Hon.  Member  while  opposing  the  introduction  has 

stated  that  the  Factories  (Amendment)  Bill,  2016  is  dependent  on  the  Factories 

(Amendment)  Bill,  2014  which  is  pending  before  the  Lok  Sabha  and  therefore 

cannot be taken up unless the Factories (Amendment) Bill, has received the assent 

of the President.  I may inform the House that only two provisions in the present 

Bill  relating  to  amendment  of  Section  64  and  65  of  the  Factories  Act,  1948  are 

similar to those contained in the Factories (Amendment) Bill, 2014.  However, this 

does  not  make  the  present  Bill  dependent  upon  the  Factories  (Amendment)  Bill, 

2014.    For  being  dependent,  the  Factories  (Amendment)  Bill,  2016  must  contain 

provisions which can be enforced only when the Factories (Amendment) Bill, 2014 

comes  into  operation.  As  the  Factories  (Amendment)  Bill,  2016  can  be  brought 

into  force  without  the  coming  into  force  of  the  2014  Bill,  the  contention  of  Shri 

Sankar Prasad Datta is not valid. 

The Bill was introduced.
