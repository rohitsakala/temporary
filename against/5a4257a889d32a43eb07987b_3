  The  Bill  amends  and  specifies  the 

definitions  of  a  factory,  hazardous  process,  manufacturing  process,  and  also 

hazardous  substance  and  disability.    The  Factories  Act,  1948  permits  the  State 

Governments  to  make  rules  regarding  any  matter.    But,  according  to  the  present 

Bill, the power of the State Governments to make rules will be restricted to matters 

where  the  Central  Government  does  not  have  such  powers.    This  is  really 

unwarranted and the Centre should not interfere in the State Governments' rights as 

it will destroy the federal structure.  The Union Government instead of bringing the 

Bill in a piecemeal form, should discuss with the State Government and seek their 

opinions to bring in an comprehensive Bill.  I would like to know the reasons for 

bringing  the  Bills  in  haste  without  seeking  opinion  from  the  State  Governments.  

Protecting  the  interests  of  every  single  employee  is  the  indispensable  duty  of  the 

employer.
