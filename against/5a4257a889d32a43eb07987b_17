  Ensuring  adequate  safety  measures  to 

the workers is the sole intention of the Factories Act of 1948.  Unfortunately, the 

proposed  amendment  Bill  is  totally  against  the  sole  intention  of  the  original  Act.  

When a comprehensive Bill is pending for consideration of the House, what is the 

emergent  necessity  in  bringing  such  an  amendment  to  Sections  64  and  65?    The 

power  to  frame  rules  is  vested  with  the  State  Government.    By  this  amendment 

arbitrary authority is being conferred upon the Government of India to frame rules.  

According  to  the  original  Act  itself,  it  has  very  far-reaching  consequences.    The 

right  of  the  State  Government  is  being  taken  away  by  the  Central  Government, 

which is against federal character of our Constitution and anti-labour.  I would like 

to  know  whether  this  is  being  done  with  the  concurrence  and  the  consent  of  the 

States.    By  allowing  125  hours  of  overtime  in  three  months,  Government  is 

indirectly banning the recruitment in factories and creating unemployment problem 

in the country.  So, my submission is to withdraw the Bill or refer this Bill also to 

the Standing Committee, which is already pursuing the recommendations.
