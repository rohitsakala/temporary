 The Government should reconsider 

this Bill. Government cannot increase the cess from Rs. 25 to 200 at one go. It is 

eight  times  increase.  This  amount  will  be  extorted  from  public  pockets.  General 

public is suffering from price-rise already and country is facing a drought situation. 

This  cess  will  worsen  the  situation  further.  The  sugar  industry  is  facing  crisis  at 

present. Under F.R.P payments have to be  made to farmers within 14 days. But it 

was  not  done  and  no  action  was  taken  against  erring  directors.  Government  may 

help sugar industry with Sugar Development Fund but not with the funds collected 

from farmers. This Bill will increase more burden on farmers. Government should 

adopt other methods to collect funds like using bio-products to help this industry.
