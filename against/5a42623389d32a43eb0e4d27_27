  Child  labour  is  a  matter  of  serious 

concern  and  it  should  be  eliminated.  The  children  should  get  the  opportunity  for 

education and should have time to play. The major reason for child labour is lack 

of education. Children from poor families take employment due to poverty. It is the 

responsibility of Government to provide facility of education to the children. There 

should be programme for skill development of the children. Suitable amendments 

should  be  made  in  the  existing  Act  and  it  should  be  implemented  across  the 

country to eradicate child labour.
