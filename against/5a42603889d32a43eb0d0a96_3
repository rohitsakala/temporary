    The  behaviour  of  Shri  Adhir  Ranjan  Chowdhury  was 

utterly  improper  and  indisciplined  too.    So,  I  name  him  for  having  disregard  the 

authority  of  the  Chair  in  abuse  of  the  rules  of  the  House  by  willfully  obstructing 

the business of the House in spite of my repeated caution given to him.
