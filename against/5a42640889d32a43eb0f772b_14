  The Creamy Layer issue is a very important one 

and that is something which this particular Bill has not addressed.  Therefore, we 

insist that somehow this cap on Creamy Layer should be raised from Rs. Six lakh 

to  Rs. 10 lakh  or Rs.  15 lakh.   The hon. Minister  must  answer  the  question as to 

what happens to the State Commissions and what would be the powers of the State 

Commissions in future.  The way there is a rise in the number of backward classes 

in  this  country,  this  27  per  cent  reservation  needs  to  be  looked  at  and  raised  in 

future.
