 The development of a country requires 

two  resources  namely  material  and  human  resources.    The  utilization  and 

development of both of these resources are imperative for the development of any 

country.  The material resources such as mines, oil and gas, coal and other mineral 

are  being  looted  by  the  corporate  houses.    At  the  same  time,  providing  them 

concession  means  a  plunder  of  tax  payers  money.      Thus  the  policy  of  the 

government to provide concession to the corporate sector is not going in favour the 

country.  The human resources are in a very pitiable condition.   Today the youths 

are  being  exploited  mentally  and  physically.  Entire  recruitment  in  the  service 

sector is either through contractual system or through outsourcing.  This is a very 

dangerous  proposition  for  our  youth.    This  will  also  not  help  to  bring  back  our 

economy on the tracks.  The standards of education have gone down, education has 

been commercialized and privatized.  Healthcare is also not in good shape as it has 

also  been  privatized.    Allocation  of  funds  under  MPLAD  scheme  should  be 

discontinued  because  this  is  a  paltry  amount  for  a  constituency  comprising  1500 

villages and 10 small & big towns.  Therefore, it should be either discontinued or it 

should be increased to Rs. 20 crore.
