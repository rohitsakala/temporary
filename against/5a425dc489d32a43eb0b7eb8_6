     I  understand  that  the  main  idea  of 

the Government in bringing this Bill is to transfer the captive mining leases granted 

otherwise  through  auction  and  would  facilitate  banks  and  financial  institutions  to 

liquidate  stressed  assets  where  a  company  or  its  captive  mines,  mining  lease  is 

mortgaged.  I  do  understand  that  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Act  is  with  the  Central 

Government.  However,  I  feel  that  before  any  action  is  taken,  the  State 

Governments  should  be  consulted  and  their  permission  should  also  be  taken 

because lands that are there also belong to the State Governments.
