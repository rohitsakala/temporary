  In  the  Business  Advisory  Committee 

meeting  we  agreed  for  listing  it  on  Tuesday.    But  we  said  we  want  to  have  a 

discussion.  But we are not getting opportunity here to discuss it.  Only in a very 

few places there are educational institutions which are doing this charity.  It is all 

right the Bill is being passed without discussion.  But for the benefit of the country 

please do not make any attempt to dilute the Act itself.  Simply because an NGO is 

running a media house and therefore they should be kept beyond the scope of this 

Act is something which we are opposing.
