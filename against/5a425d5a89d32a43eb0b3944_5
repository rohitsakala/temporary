 I do not understand why still the Supreme Court is in 

Delhi, having hearing in Delhi, filing in Delhi, disposing cases in Delhi.  Why the 

Supreme  Court  hesitant  to  move  out  of  Delhi,  at  least  to  have  Circuit  Benches?    

What  about  the  National  Judicial  Appointment  Commission?    Indian  judicial 

system has become costly affair, a rich man's game.   It has become impossible.  It 

is very difficult for a common man to seek justice.  According to the protocol, an 

MP  is  equivalent  to  a  High  Court  Judge.   There  is  no  political  difference  in  this.  

Now, what happens?  They says, they dictate, they legislate, they execute and they 

punish.    What  about  the  Right  to  Information  Act?    MPs  are  subjected  to  RTI.  

Why the courts, why the judiciary is afraid of the Right of Information Act?  You 

should  withdraw  this  Bill  and  it  should  be  given  a  thorough  scrutiny  of  the  Law 

and  Justice  Committee  but  that  would  have  been  much  better.    Why  do  we  not 

have  Indian  Judicial  Service?    It  is  the  judges  who  will  decide  their  successors.  

Before  concluding,  I  want  to  say  this.    Is  there  social  justice  in  judiciary?    How 

many  people  from  SC  and  ST  communities,    OBCs,  minorities  are  there  in 

Judiciary?    How  many  women  have  come  as  Supreme  Court  judges?    I  again 

humbly  request  our  hon.  Sadananda  Gowdaji  to  have  a  rethinking  on  this  Bill.  

Also, we have to legislate a comprehensive legislation on the salaries, allowances, 

pension, appointments, qualifications, etc.,  of  the  judiciary.   The  judiciary  should 

be  accountable  to  the  people.    The  people  of  India  are  supreme.    The  judiciary 

should  also  ensue  that  social  justice  as  enshrined  in  the  Constitution  is  being 

implemented.
