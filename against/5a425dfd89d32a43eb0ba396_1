    Two amendments have been brought 

by  Rajya  Sabha.    The  first  Amendment  is  relating  to  Clause  9.    At  the  time  of 

initiating  the  debate,  I  had  raised  a  point  that  this  is  affecting  the  constitutional 

rights  of  the  tribal  people  provided  under  Article  244,  Scheduled  V  and  VI,  that 

has to be taken care of.  We have also moved amendments but they have not been 

carried out by the Government.  I do appreciate that, at least, in the eldest House, 

the Rajya Sabha, the Government have conceded to the demands of the elders.  My 

submission to the hon. Minister as well as to the Government is that, please conced 

to  the  harmless  amendments  which  are  being  made  from  the  Opposition  side  in 

Lok Sabha.  The second amendment is regarding the District Mineral Foundation.  

Now, in Rajya Sabha, this amendment has been come to Clause 15 of the Bill.  The 

amendment  that  I  am    moving  is  that  the  word  'exclusively'  may  also  be  added 

immediately after 'shall work'.
