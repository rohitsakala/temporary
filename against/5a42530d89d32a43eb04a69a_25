  Agriculture  is  not  a  profitable 

business in India. About 70 per cent of the country's farmers are struggling to make 

ends  meet.  Even  today  60  per  cent  of  agriculture  is  rainfed  and  not  irrigated 

through a network of canals. Farm credit of Rs. 10 lakh crore has been allocated in 

the  Budget,  but  small  farmers  still  have  problem  of  access  to  formal  credit  and 

mostly  borrow  for  consumption  purposes  from  moneylenders  at  exhorbitant 

interest rates. Another trend has been farmers leaving their land to tenants to farm 

and go off to towns. The tenants do not have access to credit. Urgent steps need to 

be taken to bring down the cost of cultivation without affecting the productivity of 

crops.  If  we  want  agriculture  to  survive,  farmers  must  get  a  fair  price  for  their 

crops and good labour to work their fields. Until and unless this is there, it is very 

difficult  and  will  continue  to  be  unviable.  Easy  access  to  credit  and  better  MSPs 

can help.
