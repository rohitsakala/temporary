  It is not appropriate to 

bring  this  legislation  to  amend  only  two  sections  of  the  main  Act  in  the  name  of 

labour reforms as a comprehensive Bill on this subject is already pending.  Despite 

the  fact  that  the  report  presented  by  the  Parliamentary  Standing  Committee  on 

Labour is under examination, I fail to understand the reasons for hurry in amending 

only two sections.  It also goes beyond my understanding how the employment is 

going  to  increase  just  by  increasing  the  working  hours  of  the  existing  workers.  

This  will  only  increase  the  burden  of  the  existing  employees.    You  could  have 

brought  it  in  the  main  Act  itself.   Even  the  powers  of  the  State  Governments  are 

also being taken away through this Bill.  Labour is a subject of Concurrent List and 

hence  the  states  should  also  have  been  consulted  in  this  regard.    The  labourers 

should not be exploited in the name of Make in India, ease of doing business and 

liberalization.  Therefore, I would like to request the hon. Minister to withdraw this 

Amendment Bill and bring a fresh Bill in the next Session.
