  I  have  tremendous  amount  of 

reservations about this Bill, hence I oppose this Bill.  Clause 5(i) of this Bill says 

the Statistics Officer or any person or agencies authorized under this Act shall, for 

statistical purpose, use any information furnished under Section 6 in such manner 

as are prescribed.  Who will prescribe it and how will that data be used?  We do 

not understand how privacy is of utmost importance in a modern world.  Earlier, I 

had  opposed  it  and  even  now  I  oppose  Aadhaar  Card  which  the  Government  is 

dumping  on  the  unknowing  individuals  of  this  country.    I  am  incapable  of 

comprehending  what  kind of data etc.  is being  collected from  all of us  under  the 

guise of Aadhaar.  So, the Government is forcing the citizens to give all the data 

etc.   The Government is pushing Aadhaar in a very arbitrary and illegal manner.  

This Bill 'hands over' all the data to the bureaucracy, who will mis-utilize it against 

the citizens of this country.  

The discussion was not concluded.
