 FDDI institutes should be at par with IITs and 

IIMs  with  specialized  technology  on  footwear  products.   It  is  my  humble  request 

that one campus should be established in all States.  I have been personally trying 

to get one such institute established at Kozhikode, Kerala because Kozhikode has 

the largest footwear industry in the state.  The industry here employs over 15,000 

employees,  earning  over  Rs.1,500  crore  by  exporting  beautiful  products.    The 

Government of Kerala has also agreed to provide the required 20 acres of land in 

Knowledge  Park  at  Calicut.    I  would  also  like  to  make  some  suggestions  on  this 

Bill.  Below clause 4(3)(h), it may be added that a representative from the footwear 

industry  from  within  the  State  should  also  be  members.    It  may  be  added  below 

clause  13(g)  that  a  Member  of  Parliament  from  within  the  State  shall  be  on  the 

Senate.  Also, it may be added below clause 16(1) that the Managing Director shall 

also  be  the  Principal  of  the  Institute.    Similarly,  with  regard  to  clause  17(1), 

Secretary of the Institute shall be appointed by the Central Government for a tenure 

of  'three  years'  instead  of  five  years.    With  regard  to  admission  of  students,  they 

would be admitted on all India basis through a Common Entrance Examination as 

in  the  case  of  IITs  and  IIMs.    Similarly,  with  regard  to  Tribunal's  decision,  the 

aggrieved  should  have  to  right  approach  a  Civil  Court  at  least  at  the  level  of  the 

High Court.
