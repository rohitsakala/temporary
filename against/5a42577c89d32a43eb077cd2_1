  I  fully  accept  the  ruling  of  Madam  Speaker.  But  I  have  other  two 

objections.    The  first  objection  is  that  the  recommendations  of  the  Standing 

Committee  on  Labour  and  Employment  are  under  examination.  This  amendment 

Bill  is  having  far-reaching  consequences  but  it  has  been  brought  to  the  House 

without due consideration of the Standing Committee recommendations.  The rule 

making  provision  is  totally  vested  with  State  Governments.    Now  the  Central 

Government is taking away the rule making power of the State Government. It is 

totally against the federal character of our Constitution.
