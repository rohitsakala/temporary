  There  is  gross  lack  of  awareness  in  this 

regard.  There is no provision in this Bill to spread awareness.  If someone is HIV 

positive, either he or his family faces social boycott.  There should be provision of 

counseling in this regard.  Sometimes blood supplied from the blood banks is also 

infected.    The  blood  is  transfused  to  the  patients  without  testing  it.    We  should 

consider this aspect also.
