  NABARD  is  aimed  at  rural 

development  with  special  focus  on  agriculture,  small  scale,  cottage,  and  village 

industries.    Today,  NABARD  has  become  the  lifeline  of  rural  economy  as  it  is 

actively  engaged 

in  supporting  farmers,  rural 

infrastructure  development 

programmes, empowerment of self-help groups, etc.  NABARD has been playing a 

major role in ensuring the agricultural growth in our country.  Agricultural growth 

in  the  country  during  the  period  of  the  UPA  was  4.3  per  cent.    However,  it  has 

declined  to  2.7  per  cent.    Therefore,  it  is  high  time  that  Government  initiated 

comprehensive measures to revive the agriculture sector in the country.  Therefore, 

the discussion on this  Bill is important  for  the  revival of  agriculture  sector  in  the 

country.  However, I am afraid that the proposed amendments seek to change the 

focus  of  NABARD  from  the  agricultural  and  rural  sector  to  the  corporate  sector.  

The Government, by making this amendment is helping the large corporate groups 

to  get  loans  at  a  lower  interest  rate.  The  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  is  a 

shareholder and is the regulator of NABARD.  I am afraid that the Government's 

move to free NABARD from the control of RBI will eventually lead to functioning 

of  NABARD  in  its  own  way  without  any  norms.    Therefore, I  would  request  the 

Government to kindly retain the control of RBI over NABARD and send this Bill 

to the Parliamentary Standing Committee for a detailed study.
