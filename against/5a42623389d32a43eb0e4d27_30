  The  Bill  intends  to  prohibit  and  regulate  child 

labour, whereas its provisions promote and permit child labour. It would be cruel 

for  us  to  let  them  work  after  school  hours,  children  should  be  encouraged  to  be 

indulged  in  activities  that  promote  learning.  The  Bill  also  proposes  to  allow 

children in the age group of 14 to 18 years to be employed in a profession that is 

not of hazardous nature. I would urge a complete ban on employment of children 

below the age of 18 years except in theatre, drama, films, ads. No nation can claim 

a bigger resource for its future than its children.
