  Finance  Minister  Arun  Jaitely  has 

presented  three  budgets.  He  has  promised  of  doubling  the  farmers'  income  in  the 

next five years. I haven't seen any clear roadmap being laid out in this regard. This 

year  farmers  have  shown  resilience  and  agriculture  growth  is  expected  at  4.1  per 

cent. The  Finance  Minister  has  glossed over the prevailing  crisis by  promising to 

bring in a model law for contract farming. He has also announced the farm credit 

outlay  being  enhanced  to  Rs.  10  lakh  crore.  But  what  is  lesser  known  is  the  fact 

that bulk of the farm credit, for which an interest subvention scheme of 3 per cent 

is provided if paid back in time, is availed by the agriculture business companies. 

There  was  no  acknowledgement  of  the  terrible  agrarian  crisis  that  prevails  in  the 

budget.  Two  years  of  back-to-back  drought  and  the  unannounced  hit  by 

demonetisation has certainly accentuated the farm crisis and needed an immediated 

relief.
