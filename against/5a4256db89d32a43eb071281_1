  I  am  objecting  to  the  introduction  of  the  Inter-State  River  Water 

Disputes  (Amendment)  Bill,  2017.  Do  this  Parliament  and  the  Government  have 

the power to have a law in this manner?  I am not going into the merit of the Bill.  

At this juncture, I am only saying that this is very wrongly drafted Bill.  My only 

request  to  the  Government  is  to  reconsider  introduction  of  this  Bill.    The 

Government may prepare a good draft after consulting the respective provinces and 

come back to this House.
