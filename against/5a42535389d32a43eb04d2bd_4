  The  hon.  Finance  Minister  has  left  us  at  the 

mercy  of  rain  God  as  he  has  said  that  this  year's  monsoon  is  good  and  it  will  be 

helpful in containing the prices of commodities.  The prices of petrol came down 

from 110 dollar per barrel to 30 dollar per barrel but the government did not pass 

on its benefit to consumers.  They talk of infrastructure but its result would come 

on  the  ground  after  10  years  but  meanwhile  the  people  are  reeling  under  soaring 

prices  of  essential  commodities.    The  government  has  not  taken  any  measures  to 

lessen their sufferings.  Maximum number of farmers committed suicide during the 

NDA regime but nobody has shed tears for them.  The hon. Finance Minister has 

not  said  anything  about  as  how  he  would  check  the  rising  prices  instead  he  has 

only  enumerated  the  reasons  that  has  led  to  price  rise.      Management  is  of  two 

types  -  one  is  supply  side  management  and  another  is  demand  side  management.  

Firstly,  supply  will  have  to  be  augmented.    There  should  be  improved 

infrastructure to preserve perishable items like fruits and vegetables.  This calls for 

public  investment  in  agricultural  infrastructure  and  attracting  private  investment.  

If  public  investment  is  not  made  in  villages,  how  will  production  of  pulses 

increase?  How the farmers will be saved from suicide?  Till now, 90 per cent of 

public  investment  in  agriculture  is  made  by  the  state.    The  Centre  has  not  been 

investing in villages, this is a matter of regret.  Due to price rise the real income of 

the people is witnessing an erosion.  So actually people's income is being squeezed 

and the middle class and the lower middle classes are falling in great difficulties.
