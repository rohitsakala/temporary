  India  is  among  the  first 

countries  to  adopt  the  United  Nation's  convention  on  Rights  of  Persons  with 

Disabilities.  But unfortunately we do not have even a single building in States or 

at national level which is disabled friendly.  In fact, the Supreme Court has pointed 

out  that  even  the  private  sector  people  are  doing  better  than  the  Centre  and  the 

States and has directed the Government of India to identify at least 50 buildings to 

make  them  totally  disabled  friendly.    Although  we  are  trying  for  four  per  cent 

reservation for the disabled, we do not have a monitoring mechanism to ensure that 

whatever  percentage  is  earmarked  will  go  to  the  disabled  persons.  This  is  more 

important  than  earmarking  the  percentage  itself.    Moreover,  we  should  have  a 

clear-cut policy for disabled persons who are living in rural areas.  Special schemes 

are  very  much  required  for  social  and  economic  development  of  these  people.    I 

earnestly  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  provide  some  sports  infrastructure  at  the 

district level so that those people can also feel a part of that.
