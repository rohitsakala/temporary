    Under  Article  109  of  the 

Constitution  when  a  Money  Bill  is  transmitted  from  the  Lok  Sabha  to  the  Rajya 

Sabha, it can come back with suggestions and amendments or it can come back as 

it is.  This one has come back with suggestions.  I am not concerned with the issue 

of  privacy  which  is  pending  before  the  Supreme  Court  and  whether  it  is  a 

fundamental  right  or  not,  I  am  assuming  let  it  be  a  fundamental  right.    Under 

Article 21,  a person is entitled to his right of life and  liberty which can be taken 

away  by  a  procedure  established  by  law.      In  1935  the  United  States  started  the 

Social  Security  Number.    Last  80  years  for  each  activity,  you  need  to  give  your 

Social Security Number.  Therefore, every person gets a unique identity.  Can you 

make it compulsory? Does this encroach upon your liberty or your privacy ?  This 

debate has gone on in the United States for 80 years and every court in the world's 

most  liberal  democracy  has  said  that  it  is  a  reasonable  restriction  and  it  does  not 

violate.  So we have tightened the privacy provision.  It cannot be shared even with 

consent.  Therefore,  all  those  countries  which  have  become  a  welfare  State  insist 

that,  to  avail  of  the  welfare,  you  must  give  a  proof  of  identity.      LPG  is  a  living 

example.    We  have  deleted  the  wealthy  and  we  are  giving  it  free  to  the  poor.  In 

fact, national security is a reasonable ground for some sacrifice of privacy.   

The motion was accepted and the amendments were rejected.
