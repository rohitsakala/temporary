  The  steep  rise  of  prices  of  vegetables 

and pulses is a very serious concern in Indian homes in recent months. It has made 

the  life  of  common  people,  poor  and  middle  class  in  particular  miserable.  The 

Hon'ble Prime Minister should intervene and take necessary efforts to have a price 

control  and  regulation  policy  to  put  brakes  to  such  consistent  hike.  The  prices  of 

pulses, vegetables and other essential commodities are not increasing continuously 

due  to  a  poor  harvest  of  due  to  bad  monsoon  there  are  other  man  made  reasons 

which results the rising of prices.  The MSP of wheat, the biggest rabi food grain, 

has been raised by Rs. 75 a quintal, highest increase in recent years. If the money 

we spend on importing pulses reaches our farmers, there won't be any suicides or 

shortage of food grains.   The  Government  of  India  can  bring  down  prices  and 

protect  the  poor  by  subsiding  food  items  including  pulses  and  edible  oil;  rolling 

back the additional excise duty levied on Petrol and Diesel announced earlier this 

year; enabling cheaper movement by rail by reducing the freight rates for essential 

commodities;  reducing  the  toll  fee  collected  particularly  from  freight  vehicles; 

providing adequate input subsidy to farmers to encourage production of pulses and 

oil seeds with assured price and purchase mechanism.
