  The  basic  tenets  of  our 

constitution  is  democracy  but  the  federal  structure  is  under  attack  today  which  is 

very dangerous. We are celebrating 125th Birth anniversary of Baba Saheb but we 

are bulldozing democracy as well. It will be decided on the floor of the respective 

House  as  it  is  ethically  right  or  not.  But,  it  is  dictatorship.  The  decision  taken  in 

hubris and unimaginable boldness may destroy the democracy. This type of attack 

has  been  started  in  all  those  states  where  non-BJP  Government  is  in  power. 

Democracy  in  Uttarakhand  has  been  attacked  and  the  Constitution  has  been  torn 

apart. Therefore, imposition of President rule there is a wrong decision.
