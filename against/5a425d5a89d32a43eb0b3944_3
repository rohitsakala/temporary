  Whatever  the  Supreme  Court  says,  it  becomes 

the law of the land.  The Supreme has already ruled the hiking of the salaries of the 

High Court Judges and also an addition of 10 years' service.  What is left for the 

Parliament  to  approve  this.    We  are  publicly  accountably  every  day.    That 

accountability is missing from the Judiciary.  Whenever a progressive legislation is 

made in this august House, they strike it down on the ground of ultra vires.  We are 

accountable to the people; Judiciary is not accountable.  So many times, they have 

interfered in the functioning of the august House.  The collective will of the people 

is  in  Parliament.    There  are  no  judges  from  SC,  ST  communities  in  the  Supreme 

Court and High Courts.  Let this ten years of service be added in the service of SCs 

and STs also so that they may also get the benefits.  About 352 posts of judges are 

lying vacant in the High Courts and Supreme Court.  I request the hon. Minister to 

make  some  provisions  in  this  Bill  for  SCs  and  STs.    We  have  seen  there  are  so 

many  cases  of  corruption  and  nepotism  in  the  Judiciary.    But  where  are  they 

accountable?  Impeachment is a cumbersome process.  Therefore, there has to be 

some  accountability.    The  salary  hike  in  Judiciary  should  be  linked  to  some 

Commission.  It should not be done by themselves.  They are giving a judgment to 

themselves.
