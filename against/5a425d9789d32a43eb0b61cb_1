  I  have  no  objection 

to 

the 

 

 

 

introduction  of  this  Bill  but  I  object  to  the  reference  that  has  been  made  for 

information  of  a  Joint  Committee  and  this  is  in  sub-section  C  of  this 

Supplementary List of Business which clearly states that it is to be taken up in case 

the  Bill  at  Serial  No.  B  is  introduced.  Therefore,  I  rise  here  to  object  to  the 

formation  of  a  Joint  Parliamentary  Committee.  You  have  a  Joint  Parliamentary 

Committee  where  the  matter  is  very  urgent,  where  there  is  some  dissension 

between  this  House  and  the  other  House.  We  have  a  Standing  Committee  on 

Finance  which  is  empowered  to  go  into  this  Bill.    They  will  deliberate  on  that 

subject  threadbare,  clause  by  clause.    This  is  a  very  important  Bill  and  it  needs 

elaborate  discussion  and  deliberation  in  the  Committee  on  Finance.  This 

Committee  system  is  actually  being  relegated  to  the  background  by  repeatedly 

forming Joint Parliamentary Committees.  I would like to be educated by the hon. 

Minister about the necessity for having a Joint Parliamentary Committee in regard 

to this Bill.
