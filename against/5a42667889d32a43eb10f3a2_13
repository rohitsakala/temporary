  Until  the  education  is  made  employment 

oriented the social and economic backwardness of the disabled persons cannot be 

removed.    The  Government  should  have  proper  monitoring  over  the  activities  of 

those NGOs which are indulging in loot in the name of the disabled persons.  The 

guaranteed  pension  of  at  least  three  or  five  thousand  should  be  provided  to  the 

disabled which will go a long way in ensuring social and economic development of 

these  people.    Besides,  there  is  a  need  to  setup  a  commission  for  them  and  the 

public representatives should be given representation in them at the district level.
