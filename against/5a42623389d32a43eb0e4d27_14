  It  seems  that  this  Bill  will  not  be  able  to 

prohibit child labour.  Number of child labour is more in poor states. This makes it 

clear  that  if  we  want  to  reduce  the  child  labour,  we  will  first  have  to  eradicate 

poverty  from  the  country.    Increasing  population  of  the  country  and  lack  of 

education are  aso major reasons for child labour.  Mostly, the children of the poor 

families are compelled to work as child labour.  Though all the parties want to put 

an end to this problem, the problem of child will always remain there till poverty is 

there  in  the  country.    We  cannot  find  a  lasting  solution  to  this  problem  merely 

bringing in amendments in laws.  Finally, I would like to request the Government 

that it should consider the suggestions given by the Members of Opposition parties 

and try to act upon them.
