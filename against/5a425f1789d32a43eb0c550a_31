   Much has been said about the transparency, 

accountability and about other benefits that will accrue out of GST and all these 

Bills.  My  concern  is  regarding  the  two  clauses  of  the  Central  GST  Bill  that  is 

Clauses 9 and 10 and Clause 6 of the Integrated GST Bill. By these provisions 

of law, the powers vested with the State legislatures and the State Governments 

are being taken away. The GST Council has been empowered with the powers 

to decide the tax rates. The parliamentarians privilege is to deliberate on the tax 

which is going to be levied on the people. That privilege is being taken away by 

this  Act.  According  to  article  253  of  the  Constitution,  it  is  for  the  Central 

Government to make legislations. Without being ratified by the Parliament and 

the State Legislatures, all these Agreements are being implemented. As a result 

of  such  provisions  of  law,  the  poor  farmers,  especially  the  farmers  who  are 

growing  cash  crops  are  affected.  There  is  no  specific  mention  about  the  cash 

crops as to under what category it is being treated. How can we include all these 

items under one slab? This is not clarified. So, I urge upon the Government to 

have a re-look on this. Without even amending article 265 of the Constitution, 

the powers vested on us are being taken away. So, for ensuring the benefit of the 

people,  the  Government  should  have  a  re-look  and  I  hope  there  will  be  some 

amendments on this issue.
