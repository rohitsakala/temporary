 This Bill has been brought to curb the 

nuisance of illegal transactions that have been plaguing our country.  Most of the 

black  money  generated  domestically  is  due  to  real  estate  transactions.    This  Bill 

does not take into account such different cultural compulsions existing in different 

parts of the country.  This Bill has the provision to seize benami property and hand 

it  over  to  the  Central  Government.    This  is  against  the  core  spirit  of  federalism 

since  land  is  a  State  subject.    I  would  like  a  clarification  from  the  Minister  on 

whether  passing  this  Bill  would  lead  to  conflict  with  the  Income  Tax  Act,  1961.  

Black  money  from  abroad  should  be  brought  back  to  stop  benami  transactions 

domestically.  Savings of the poor and sundry should not be taken away by shrewd 

and  fraudulent  persons.    My  party  feels  that  this  is  an  incomplete  and  haphazard 

Bill which needs to be relooked even though the Standing Committee has already 

scrutinized it.
