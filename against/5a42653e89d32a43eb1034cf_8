  There  must  be  some  provisions  to 

compensate  the  States  for  certain  period  for  their  revenue  loss.    There  are  some 

States  having  their  resources,  minerals  etc,  but  they  are  not  the  manufacturing  or 

consuming States.  So, those States would be losing the revenue.  Therefore, all the 

States  should  be looked  after and get the  benefit.    Secondly, it  is proposed in  the 

Bill  about  the  formation  of  a  GST  Council.    This  GST  Council  should  be 

empowered by the legislation.  Unless the States are empowered and benefited; and 

if  the  taxes  and  revenue  would  not  flow  to  the  States,  how  would  the  very 

fundamental  programmes  be  undertaken  by  the  States?    With  regard  to  alcohol, 

there should be some thought given to it whether alcohol and other related products 

should  be  brought  under  the  collective  net.    I  would  recommend  that  this  Bill 

should  be  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee.    The  Finance  Minister  of  that 

particular  State  is  the  Chairman  of  the  empowered  Committee.  This  is  a  good 

gesture.  But there should be some propriety.  So, it should be chaired by someone 

else.    In  the  73rd  and  74th  Amendments,  the  local  bodies  are  empowered  to  raise 

some resources for their development and for other things.  In this Bill, there is no 

clarity on that.  So, I think this issue should be discussed further.
