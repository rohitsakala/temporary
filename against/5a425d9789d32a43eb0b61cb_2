  It  is  normally  the  practice  that  any  legislation 

concerning any Ministry or any Department is automatically referred to a Standing 

Committee.  Unless it is a small amendment or a trivial amendment, any Bill of a 

substantial  nature  is  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee.    As  our  esteemed 

colleague has so eloquently stated that, process should not be given a go-by.  Why 

should that Standing Committee be bypassed or be overridden by the Government's 

desire to bring in a Bill?
