    My  first  submission  is  regarding  the 

Standing Committee.  That Committee has said that the Bill is unconstitutional and 

the Bill has to be reviewed.  The Report shows that most of the provisions of the 

Bill  are  against  the  Fundamental  Rights  under  the  Constitution.    It  is  against  the 

UN Declaration on Rights of the Children, to which India is a signatory from 1992.  

The hon. Speaker has intimated his House that clause 7 is going to be negatived.  It 

is fully welcome.  If this Bill goes to the Court, it will definitely be struck down.  

So, there is a need to review this Bill.
