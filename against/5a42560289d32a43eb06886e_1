 The cess is proposed to be increased from Rs.25/- 

to  Rs.200/-  in  the  amendment  bill.    This  will  adversely  affect  the  financial 

condition  of  the  sugar  mills.    The  sugarcane  growers  are  also  not  going  to  be 

benefited either.  Today, sugar industries are on the verge of closure and hence we 

should try to sort out their problems.  The Government released Rs.6000 crore for 

sugar mills but no mill succeeded to get even a single penny due to the eligibility 

conditions prescribed therefore.  Consequently, no farmer is getting their arrear of 

payment.    If  any  mill  is  paying  their  arrears,  it  is  doing  so  by  disposing  of  its 

assets.    The  levy  of  cess  will  fructify  only  when  the  varieties  of  sugarcanes  are 

improved.    The  efforts  should  be  made  to  revive  the  closed  sugar  mills.    The 

programme chalked out by you is not going to be successful as this has brought the 

farmers  at  the  loser's  end.    Therefore,  the  Government  should  have  a  specific 

policy for sugarcane.
