  The Government talks of reducing the cost of 

litigation.  However, it is my belief that we may not achieve this since there is no 

transparency  in  this  Bill  regarding  fees.    I  am  of  the  view  that  appointments  of 

Judges  for this  purpose  should  be the  same  as their  appointments  in other  courts.  

Such  appointments  can  be  made  by  a  panel  of  commercial  experts.    I  hope  that 

about one crore commercial cases pending in various courts would be disposed of 

quickly.   My  suggestion is that the limit  of  one  crore  rupee should  be  reduced  to 

rupee 25 lakhs.   There should be provision strict implementation of the law.  I am 

of the view that if the Government succeeds in bringing complete transparency in 

this Bill then those who prefer Singapore and London to settle their cases will be 

attracted to India for speedy disposal.
