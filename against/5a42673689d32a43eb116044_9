  At  present,  only  products 

and  systems  come  under  the  ambit  of  standards.    The  Bill  proposes  to  include 

services  besides  articles  and  processes  under  the  standardization  regime.    It  will 

also enable the Government to bring under the mandatory certification regime such 

article,  process  or  service  which  it  considers  necessary  from  the  point  of  view  of 

health,  safety,  environment,  prevention  of  deceptive  practices,  security,  etc.    The 

mandatory certification will help consumers receive ISI certified products and will 

also  help  in  prevention  of  import  of  sub-standard  products.    It  is  being  widely 

reported in the news that dangerous chemicals are used in important food products.  

It is time the country acts against all kinds of adulterated foods in the country.  One 

of  the  reasons  why  India  has  not  captured  export  markets  is  the  quality  issue.  

While  enacting  legislation  with  good  intensions  is  welcome,  what  is  more 

important  is  actually  achieving  the  high  standards.    Otherwise,  all  our  efforts  of 

emerging as a major global player will not bear fruit. 

 

SHRI  AKSHAY  YADAV:  I  would  like  to  thank  the  hon.  Minister  for 

bringing this Bill.  The Bill talks about abolishing inspector raj.  I welcome it but 

whenever  a  stringent  law  is  enacted  there  is  always  a  lingering  fear  whether  that 

particular  law  will  promote  corruption.      I  would  like  to  suggest  to  the  hon. 

Minister  that  consumers  and  consumer  forums  should  also  be  given  a  say  in  the 

matter  of  quality  enhancement  potential.    We  always  talk  about  international 

standards.    The  reason  behind  this  is  that  we  lack  faith  in  Indian  products.    We 

have  restore  this  faith.    I  would  appeal  that  our  natural  products  should  be 

preserved and this Bill be passed unanimously and implemented properly.
