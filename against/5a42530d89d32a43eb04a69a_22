  The  agriculture  sector  of  India  is  struggling  at 

different levels.  We have placed agriculture sector on the backburner in our bid to 

add  much  importance  to  Make  in  India,  Digital  India  and  Startup    India.    The 

Government vehemently says that it will double the income of the farmers but it is 

a matter of sorrow that the incidents of suicides by the farmers are being reported 

almost from  every state.  It is high time that we must think as seriously about the 

agriculture sector and the farmers as the manufacturing units, industries and other 

service sectors.  The total allocation for a very important scheme of the agriculture 

sector namely National Agriculture Development Scheme has been slashed  from 

Rs.9594  crore  in  2013-14  to  Rs.4750  crore  in  2017-18.    The  Government  has 

introduced  organic  value  chain  development  for  North  Eastern  states  and  for  the 

year 2015-16, a sum of Rs.133 crore was provided for it.  This year, this allocation 

has been reduced by Rs.100 crore.  The Government will have to take care of the 

people living in North East states also.   The Government needs to open a National 

Organic  Farming  Institute  and  also  a  veterinary  college  in  Arunachal  Pradesh.  

When the Government says that it will waive off the loans of farmers then I would 

like to ask whether Arunachal Pradesh or North Eastern states or other states of the 

country  are  not  the  part  of  India.    The  Government  should,  therefore,  give  an 

assurance that it will waive off the loans of farmers of these states also this time.
