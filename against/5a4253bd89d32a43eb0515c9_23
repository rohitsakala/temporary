  We  are  opposed  to  the 

imposition of President's Rule in principle because for the first time in the history 

of  Independent  India,  the  Akali  Government  under  the  leadership  of  Gyan  Singh 

Radewala  was  dislodged  by  using  Article  356.    Again  in  1980  the  Badal 

Government  was  dislodged  by  using  the  same  Article.    Today,  the  Congress 

leaders  are  opposing  the  imposition  of  President's  Rule  in  Uttarakhand.    It  is 

because now they have realised what is the pain of using Article 356.  it is true that 

we  have  to  think  about  the  situation  that  has  arisen  in  Uttarakhand  today.    There 

was no other alternative before the Central Government but to impose President's 

Rule there and they have done so out of compulsion.
