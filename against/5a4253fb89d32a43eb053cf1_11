  This  Bill  is  against  the  interests  of  the 

country  as  it  will  badly  affect  the  bordering  States  of  Assam,  Meghalaya,  West 

Bengal  and  Tripura.    There    are  other  ways  of  building  relationship  with 

neighbours.    Giving  away  land  of  States  like  Assam  where  we  lose  lakhs  of 

hectares  every  year  to  erosion  and  flood,  is  not  the  only  way  of  having  good 

friendly  relationship  with  neighbours,  and  this  will  not  solve  the  boundary 

problem.  We feel the boundary problem should be permanently solved by erecting 

a  concrete  wall  between  India  and  Bangladesh.    Our  hon.  Prime  Minister  had 

promised that not even an inch of land will be given to Bangladesh.  I request him 

to keep his promise.
