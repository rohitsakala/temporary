 With great responsibility I want to say that 

if  this  Bill  becomes  a  law  then  certainly  it  would  be  misused  mostly  against  the 

muslim,  adivasi  and  dalit  children.    On  27th  April  CRPF  and  special  task  force 

arrested  3  adivasi  girls  who  were  15  years  old  and  grazing  cattle  in  Komagundai 

village,  Sukma  district,  Chhattisgarh,  these  girls  ran  away  on  seeing  them.    The 

CRPF  and  the  special  task  force  arrested  them  on  the  charge  that  they  had  run 

away on seeing them.   Even now these girl are in jail under the Arms Act.  The 

JJB  will  decide  three  factors  -  sending  a  child  to  adult  criminal  justice  system; 

circumstances  of  an  offence.    The  third  one  is  age  determination  on  the  basis  of 

physical appearance.  Regarding bone ossification test, there is an error margin of 

two years.  The old system as per the JJ Act of 2000 was much better. There was 

an error of only six months.  Clause 16 deals with preliminary assessment by the 

Juvenile Justice Board.  It goes against articles 14 and 21 of our Constitution.  The 

clauses in the present Bill clearly violate UNCRC reform and rehabilitation.  I am 

going  on  record  and  saying  tomorrow  Section  121  (b)  will  be  imposed  on  Dalit, 

Adivasi and Muslim children.  The children are the foundation of our nation.  But 

Bill will make them criminals by sending them to jails.  This will be struck down 

by the Supreme Court.
