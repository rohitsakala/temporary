    The  Bill  seeks  to  repeal  the  Anti-

Hijacking Act of 1982 to give effect to the Hague Convention for the Suppression 

of  Unlawful  Seizure  of  Aircraft,  1970  and  the  Beijing  Convention  of  2010  to 

which the Government of India is a signatory.  I have an objection in the case of 

punishment  clause  particularly  to  death  penalty,  as  we  have  seen  that  race  and 

place  determine  who  lives  and  who  dies.    I  urge  upon  the  Minister  that  death 

penalty  should  not  be  the  and  other  stringent  actions  should  be  there  for  people 

who are involved in cases of hijacking.
