 The Bill is not covering the environmental 

issue.  This Act was necessary for long.  The claim which is required to be decided 

by the High Court by reason of this enactment of the Act, itself has been codified 

under  clause  4.    There  are  certain  vague  provisions  in  the  Bill  as  to  which  High 

Court is having the jurisdiction in the sea itself.  Clarity is not there in this Section.  

There  is  a  need  to  do  away  with  some  contradiction  of  draft  in  matters  of 

jurisdiction.  Now, I am coming to a very important point.  Now you are giving the 

jurisdiction  to  the  High  Courts  to  decide.    How  can  the  High  Courts  take  up  the 

workload of all these things?  Vacancies are not being filled up.  Kindly fill up the 

vacancies first.  Unless you fill up the vacancies, not only this but nothing will be 

done.  The territorial water jurisdiction has to be identified.  Now, it is not much 

difficult because new mechanisms like satellite etc. have come in and they may be 

used to do it.
