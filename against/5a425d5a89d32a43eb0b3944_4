  After  going  through  this  Bill,  I  feel  that  it  is 

not  going  to  be  simplified  but  it  is  further  going  to  be  complicated.    I  think,  the 

hon.  Law  Minister  should  withdraw  this  Amendment  Bill  and  come  with  a 

comprehensive  legislation  with  regard  to  the  salaries  and  allowances  of  both  the 

High  Court  Judges  and  the  Supreme  Court  judges.    There  are  28  Clauses  to  this 

Bill.  I am unable to understand each Clause as a Member of Parliament and also as 

an  advocate  earlier.    It  is  a  fact  that  10  years'  service  as  a  practising  advocate  is 

necessary  to  become  a  High  Court  judge.    Tomorrow  some  judge  who  had  been 

elevated from the bar, after retirement, can say that he practised for 32 years and he 

was elevated to the High Court judge and so, his 32 years' of practising advocate 

service should be counted as his service.  Only for the reason of that judgment, we 

should  not  come  forward  with  amending  the  main  Acts.    I  am  not  against 

increasing their salaries or pension.  I feel that this legislation may not resolve the 

complex issue that is before us.  Hon. Law Minister should withdraw this Bill and 

come with a comprehensive legislation, and that legislation may be referred to the 

Standing Committee on Law and Justice.  After a thorough study we can pass that 

legislation.
