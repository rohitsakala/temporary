  We should always bear in mind that we 

do  not  end  up  reducing  the  importance  of  the  Parliament  in  the  process  of 

passing the legislations having the far reaching or game changing implications 

for the country.  I would also like to say that this is not a new policy.  It is but 

like a stream of policy decisions which has faced hurdles and speed breakers on 

its way and we have successfully overcome those obstacles.  On one hand, it is 

being  propagated  that  our  economic  philosophy  underpinned  by  the  free 

capitalism should be uniform across the world while maintaining an integrated 

market  across  the  globe,  on  the  other  hand  efforts  are  being  made  to  bring 

parochialism into the philosophy based on universal values.  The growth during 

the last 70 years has been city centric, capital centric and factory centric instead 

of being agricultural centric, farmer centric and rural centric.  There should be 

development in our backward areas.  I would like to know whether we are going 

to  include  those  areas  into  our  newly  emerging  India  and  if  the  reply  is 

affirmative  then  how  the  Government  propose  to  do  it.    I  would  like  to  know 

from the government as to what kind of efforts it is going to make to address the 

problem of regional imbalance.  GST is essentially an indirect tax.  On one hand 

the government is making announcement to reduce direct tax while on the other 

it  is  increasing  the  indirect  tax  like  GST  whose  burden  is  to  be  shared  by  all.  

The  divide  between  rich  and  poor  will  go  on  increasing  and  it  won't  reduce.  

The government has included bidi in the list of luxury goods.  There is a need to 

remove it from that list.
