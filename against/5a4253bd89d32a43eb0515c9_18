    As  a  regional  party,  we  are  opposed  to 

President's  rule  under  Article  356  being  imposed  anywhere  in  any  state.    I  had 

expected the present Government to concentrate on development, which they had 

promised,  but  they  have  indulged  in  solid  horse-trading  which  is  unfortunate.    In 

the  15-odd  years  that  Uttarakhand  has  been  a  state,  development  has  not  taken 

place.    What  are  the  basic  facts?    A  Congress  Government  was  there;  nine 

Congress MLAs were supposed to have defected from the Party.  The Budget was 

placed  before  the  Assembly.    The  Speaker  said  that  the  Budget  was  passed  by  a 

voice vote, which was disputed by many people.  One day before the floor test was 

to    take  place,  the  Government  imposed  President's  rule  on  Uttarakhand.    The 

Supreme Court has not given its final view in the matter yet.  In Uttarakhand case 

the  specialty  is  that  the  Governor  did  not  recommend  the  President's  Rule.    The 

Finance  Minister  earlier  said  that  it  was  essential  incumbent  on  the  Central 

Government to have the Appropriation Bill passed.  I feel that there was no such 

hurry.    I  think  the  argument  of  the  Government  in  this  matter  is  fallacious.  

Tomorrow,  let  the  floor  test  take  place.    Let  the  Government  of  India  assure  this 

House that popular Government would be resorted in Uttarakhand at the earlier.
