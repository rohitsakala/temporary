 Agriculture and farmer welfare are very 

important issues.  Farmers face difficulties in settlement of their claims under crop 

insurance scheme.  44 per cent claims in Haryana have been rejected.  If the crops 

of farmers are destroyed due to natural calamities, their insurance claim should be 

settled  immediately.    Horticulture  should  also  be  brought  under  crop  insurance 

scheme.  Soil health records should also be digitized like revenue records.  There is 

a limit under Kishan Credit Card.  Rs. 3 lakh only are given at 4 per cent interest 

for  one  acre  holding.    This  limit  should  be  enhanced  to  Rs.  8  lakh.    To  promote 

new  initiatives  in  agriculture  sector,  loans  upto    Rs.  3  lakh  should  be  advanced 

without  collateral  under  Kishan  Credit  Card.    Enhanced  rate  of  interest  of  7  per 

cent is charged on the loan advanced on Kishan Credit Card after 6 months.  This 

time  limit  of  6  months  should  be  enhanced  to  one  years.    One  bag  of  potato  is 

going for Rs. 50 at present whereas its cost is more than that.  BJP in its election 

manifesto  of  Uttar  Pradesh  had  promised  loan  waiver  of  farmer  whereas  on  the 

contrary  the  central  government  says  that  loans  of  farmers  cannot  be  waived.    I 

request the government to complete the work on Satluj-Yamuna link according to 

the order of hon. Supreme Court at the earliest.
