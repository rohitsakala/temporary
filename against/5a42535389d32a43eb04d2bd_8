  In  the  last  five  years,  the  prices  of  eight 

essential commodities have gone up by nearly 72 per cent and on the contrary the 

per  capita  income  has  gone  up  by  only  38  per  cent  of  average  Indian  in  metros.  

Inflation can be controlled to a large extent if the government gives full freedom to 

farmers to sell their agricultural produce anywhere in India without any restriction 

and  without  taxing  the  same.    All  the  agricultural  produce  is  controlled  by 

hoarders,  black  marketers  and  other  rich  and  traditional  traders.    They  create 

artificial shortage.  The real farmers are getting only one-third of the market price.  

A Comprehensive reforms, development of agriculture, infrastructure, elimination 

of  hoarders  and  black  marketers  etc  is  necessary  to  eliminate  artificial  scarcity 

plaguing the economy.
