 India is on 143rd position in terms of education.  

Investment in education by the government in India is least in world.  About 20000 

teachers have been found to be fake in 608 engineering colleges of Uttar Pradesh.  

Without  strengthening  the  government  system,  imparting  education  to  the 

deprived,  weak,  dalit  and  the  common  people  of  the  society  cannot  be  imagined.  

We have not been able to make fighter jet or even a small items despite giving best 

education in the history of the world to more than 10000 engineers of the world in 

computer science, electronic, mechanical, chemical and electrical engineering etc. 

We are still struggling to send cryogenic  rocket into space.  There is a shortage of 

2700  scientists  in  the  DRDO,  however,  the  promising  youngsters  need  money.  

The  tendency  of  suicide  should  be  checked  which  has  grown  due  to  our  political 

system.  The system of raising fees may be checked.
