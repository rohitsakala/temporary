 Finance Minister in this Budget Session 

declared that farmers' income will be doubled by 2022 but he did not give any road 

map to achieve this. The true picture is actually foggy and uncertain. Farmers are 

migrating to urban area in search of job and food. Farmers decentants are no longer 

interested in farming, they are looking for alternative job, due to gradual decrease 

in  income  and  suicide  by  farmers  are  continuing  to  rise.  Subsidy  in  fertilizer  is 

beneficial mainly for multinationals not for farmers. Banking credit system should 

be different and should be as per requirement.
