 Every section of the society is facing difficulty 

due  to  increase  in  the  prices  of  almost  every  commodity.  It  has  become  very 

difficult  for  a  common  man  to  run  the  family.  The  major  reason  of  price  rise  is 

decrease  in  the  production.  Hoarding  is  also  a  major  reason.  Hoarding  should  be 

checked. A number of measures have been taken by the Government to check the 

price  rise.  Pulses  have  been  imported.  Steps  have  been  taken  to  check  hoarding. 

But  despite  these  efforts,  the  prices  have  not  come  down,  rather  there  has  been 

increase  in  the  price  level.  Consumers  are  also  getting  affected  due  to 

determination  of  prices  on  the  basis  of  forward  market.  Provisions  of  Essential 

Commodities  Act,  1955  should  be  implemented  strictly  in  coordination  between 

the  centre  and  the  states.  The  availability  of  essential  commodities  at  fair  prices 

should  be  ensured  by  strengthening  the  Public  Distribution  System.  I  express  my 

thank  to  the  Government  for  taking  steps  to  check  the  prices  of  essential 

commodities.  

 

DR. RATNA DE (NAG): Prices of essential commodities are skyrocketing 

every given day. There is no stopping of this trend over the decades. If someone is 

affected  the  most,  it  is  the  common  man.  Common  man's  life  has  become 

miserable. It is definitely an alarming and disturbing for the poor and those people 

living below the poverty line or living hand to mouth and find it very difficult to 

make  ends  meet.  How  is  the  Government  going  to  address  this  issue?  It  is  the 

responsibility  system.  It  seems  the  Government  has  failed  to  address  the  rising 

prices of essential commodities. A monitoring cell should be set up at the centre to 

see  that  no  trade  is  hoarding  the  essential  commodities  or  indulging  in  black-

marketing.
