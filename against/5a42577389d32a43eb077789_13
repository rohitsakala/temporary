 Out of approximately 190 institutes funded by 

the Central Government, Mumbai has only 13 Institutes not even 10 per cent.  The 

requirement  is  25  per  cent.    I  would  request  the  HRD  Minister,  through  you,  to 

instruct  the  concerned  authorities  of  the  MTNL,  Mumbai  to  allot  the  CETTM 

campus  for  relocation  of  Mumbai  National  Law  University  as  per  their 

requirement.   SNDT Women's  University  should be granted  the  status of  Central 

University.    This  University  already  has  a  national  presence  and  offers  over  200 

full-fledged  programmes  ranging  from  under-graduate  to  Ph.D.    I  would  request 

the hon. Minister of Human Resource Development to consider granting of Central 

University status to SNDT University and look into the Law University issue and 

the National Institute of Technology in Mumbai.
