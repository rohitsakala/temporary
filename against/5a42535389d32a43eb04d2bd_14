  The  speech  of  the  Hon.  Finance  Minister  was  

very  disappointing  as  he  tried  to  prove,  with  figures  and  reasons,  that  it  is  not 

possible  to  check  the  price-rise.    His  speech  gave  an  impression  that  this 

Government  is  least  bothered  whether  the  prices  go  up  or  come  down.    This 

Government made a promise during the elections that they would bring the prices 

down but it has failed in doing so.  The President of Bhartiya Janta Party termed 

those  promises  as  'Chunavi  Jumla'.    Increased  prices  have  become  curse  to  us. 

Earlier, people used to say that even if they would not be able to do big things, they 

would at least get 'dal-roti'. But, today, even pulses are not affordable to the middle 

class people.  Inflation has reached at 7.88 per cent which is the highest in last 23 

months.   Like pulses, prices of  vegetables  are  also very  high.  Till now, the  high 

prices affected the urban people more.  But now, it is seen that villages are more 

affected  by  high  prices.    The  Government  claims  that  it  is  taking  strict  action 

against hoarders.  But, hoarding goes unabated.  In the end, I would say that if the 

Government is serious to check the price-rise, it will have to take right measures.
