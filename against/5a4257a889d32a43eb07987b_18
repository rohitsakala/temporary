  The Factories Act, 1948 has been enacted after 

the Independence and before the adoption of the Constitution.  By this legislation, 

the safety, health and welfare of the workers of the factories have been taken care 

of.    By  this  amendment,  the  State  has  extended  its  hands  to  the  factories  by 

appointing a welfare officer to ensure safety and welfare of the workers.  But, we 

have been told that our nation is a welfare State.  But if this amendment is passed 

by this House, we can no more say that this is a welfare State.  Our nation should 

not  be  run  by  the  corporates.    But,  our  nation  should  be  run  for  ensuring  the 

welfare of the poor and the down-trodden workers.  The Government is enhancing 

the  overtime  hours.    It  will  impede  employment  opportunities  and  will  affect  the 

very health of the poor workers.  So, I would request the hon. Minister to withdraw 

this amendment.
