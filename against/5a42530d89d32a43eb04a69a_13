  Regarding  my  Parliamentary  Constituency 

Munger, I  would  like  to submit  that  'Mokama-Barahiya-Faluta'  region  covering 9 

districts  of  Bihar  is  distinguished  for  the  production  of  oilseeds  and  pulses.  It  is 

called  Toal  area.  By  virtue  of  its  location  it  is  the  most  suitable  area  for 

development  from  every  point  of  view.  The  Government  should  construct  dams 

and  barrage  in  this  Toal  area  so  that  water  is  properly  managed  there.  By  doing 

this, farmers can grow three crops in a year. I would also like to suggest to allocate 

maximum  funds  for  this  Toal  area  in  the  interest  of  farmers.  In  order  that  water 

reaches  easily  to  thousands  of  acres  of  land  in  Jamalpur  and  Dharhara  circles, 

Dakranala  Irrigation  Pump  Scheme  was  launched  in  Haero  Diyara  panchayat  in 

Munger so that farmers may grow 3 crops a year. But his scheme is lying pending 

for 20 years. I request the Government to take suitable measures in this regard.
