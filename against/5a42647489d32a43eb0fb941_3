    The  year  1925  was  a historical  year 

for  India  because  the  same  year  the  Gurdwara  Act  was  created,  the  Gurdwara 

Prabandhan Committee was born.  The Hindu majority in this country still believes 

that  Sikhs  are  an  integral  part  of  this  country,  they  are  a  brave  race  and  they  ae 

primarily  responsible  for  thwarting  any  kind of  attacks  from  the  marauders, from 

the  foreigners  coming  in  from  Central  Asia  and  many  other  parts  of  the  world. 

They were the bulwark which protected the sanity, the security of the subcontinent 

called  India.     Guru Nanakji  was  a  great devotee of  Lord Jagannath  and  in  many 

Odiya  homes,  you  will  find  pictures  of  Guru  Nanakji;  amongst  Jangannath  and 

other  deities.    So  we  have  a  right  to  speak  here  and  to  support  you.    We  see  a 

situation in  this  country  that  a  mindset is formed  which tries  to take  into  account 

exclusivity.  But people of the country do not support such policies.
