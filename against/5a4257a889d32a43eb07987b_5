  It  is  clear  and  evident  from  the 

clauses of the Bill, possibly the Government is working overtime to infringe upon 

the  autonomy  of  the  State  as  a  whole.    The  hon.  Minister  of  Labour  and 

Employment  has  stated  three  things.    Firstly,  this  amendment  will  boost 

manufacturing.  Secondly, it will improve the ease of doing business and thirdly, it 

will  improve  the  unemployment  problem.    We  are  not  clear  what  prompted  the 

hon. Minister and the Government to come out with this clause and say that it will 

improve  employment  position  but  actually  it  will  deteriorate  unemployment 

position.  Cornell University of USA has done this study all across the globe.  The 

study  says  that  when  the  working  hours,  increase  beyond  60  hours  per  week,  it 

creates  a  huge  work-family  conflict.    More  number  of  working  hours  has  led  to 

consumption of tobacco, consumption of alcohol, obesity of men and depression in 

women.    The  same  study  has  said  that  when  the  working  hours  go  beyond  60 

hours,  there  is  reduction  in  the  performance  to  the  extent  of  25  per  cent.    45  per 

cent of the global deaths in the hazardous industries are happening in India.  Are 

you  going  to  look  at  the  demands  of  the  industry  or  also  going  to  look  at  the 

welfare of the people and welfare of the State as a whole?
