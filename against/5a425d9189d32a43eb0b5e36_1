 The supercilious manner by which the Bill has been 

introduced  is  simply  humiliating  the  Parliamentary  system  of  our  country.  More 

often than not, this Government is trying to hoodwink the Parliamentary system of 

our  country  sometimes  by  resorting  to  ordinances.  Again,  in  a  supercilious  and  a 

cavalier  manner,  the  Government  has  introduced  the  Financial  Resolution  and 

Deposit  Insurance  Bill,  and  I  think  that  this  kind  of  introduction  certainly 

undermines  our  Parliamentary  system.  Therefore,  I  am  opposing  the  introduction 

of the Bill.
