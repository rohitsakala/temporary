 The myth that the big banks are automatically 

strong banks has since broken by experience of failures of many big private banks 

worldwide, including in the USA.  While the SBI as a standalone entity reported a 

profit a Rs. 10,484 crore for the year 2016-17, the new consolidated SBI after the 

merger  of  five  associate  banks  made  a  loss  of  Rs.  390  crore  for  the  same  year.  

There  are  no  short  cuts  to  rehabilitating  banks  except  taking  strong  measures  for 

the  recovery  of  sticky  loans  of  State-owned  banks  and  recapitalization  of 

beleaguered banks.  The public sector banks have to be defended and saved.
