    In  this  Budget,  an  additional 

allocation of Rs.20,000 crore to the long-term irrigation fund set up by the National 

Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) will especially help the 

farmers  in  rainfed  areas,  whose  farming  is  often  a  gamble  on  monsoon.      Again, 

Miniscule Proportion of Capital expenditure is a worrying sign.  More fund should 

be  allocated  for  such  schemes  for  land  development  and  mechanization.    In  this 

budget, decreasing  share  of  Centre's  expenditure  on  agriculture  has  been  noticed.   

I  call  upon  the  Government  to  take  note  of  the  increasing  drought  and  farmer 

suicides  in  the  country.    The  agriculture  sector  in  India  is  characterized  by  low 

productivity  and  incomes  because  Land  inequality  has  been  a  major  issue  since 

independence.  Water is another critical input to agriculture.   Lack of knowledge 

and training on optimum usage of fertilizer and pesticide are also reasons for low 

productivity.    Similarly,  access  to  timely,  institutional  credit  is  very  essential  for 

farmers  to  purchase  quality  inputs.  Also,  MSP  is  limited  to  23  crops  only.    The 

Government  made the  use  of  Aadhaar  mandatory  as proof of identity, in order to 

avail of crop insurance schemes. This is very detrimental in the development of the 

nation  as  a  whole.    In  addition  to  the  above  issues,  certain  factors  also  need 

attention.    I  would  urge  the  government  to  take  cognisance  of  the  issues  with 

respect to the distress faced by farmers in India and take adequate steps to address 

the same.
