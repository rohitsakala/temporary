  The  Government  may  enact  as 

many  legislations  as  it  wants  but  the  nation  will  not  be  prosperous  unless  the 

welfare  of  farmer  community  is  taken  care  of.      The  Government  should  also 

enact such laws that no one is forced to commit suicide due to starvation or debt 

burden.    The  Government  has  promised  to  provide  employment  to  the 

unemployed  but    it  is  not  clear  when  it  is  going  to  fulfill  its  promise.    I  think 

breaking  of  promise  is  also  a  sort  of  corruption.    The  people  have  great 

expectations  from  this  Government  and  I  hope  that  this  Government  would 

provide jobs to all the unemployed youth and would not indulge in any sort of 

discrimination  against  anybody.    It  should  also  bring  its  proposals  for  the 

betterment  of  the  poor,  labourers,  farmers  and  women.    Finally,  I  believe  that 

the Government would fulfill all the promises it has made to the people of the 

country.
