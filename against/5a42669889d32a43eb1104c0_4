 Under the Act, bonus is calculated on the 

basis  of  the  employee's  salary  and  the  profit  of  the  establishment.    If  the 

establishment  says  that  it  has  not  earned  profit,  it  would  decline  to  pay  bonus.  

What  is  the  solution  for  such  type  of  a  situation?    In  Mumbai  and  other  parts  of 

Maharashtra, there is a tendency among the corporate companies to make duplicate 

annual  reports  and  accounts  and  misguide  the  Government  agencies.    The  Act 

provides that the Central Government may make rules to implement its provisions.  

I  am  glad  to  say  that  the  Central  Government  has  accepted  nine  demands  out  of 

twelve  submitted  by  the  trade  unions.    The  hon.  Minister  says  that  the  Bill  will 

come  into  effect  from  1st  April,  2015.    But  recently  we  have  received  the 

amendment. It is made now 2014.  We are going to pass it today.  I do not know 

how it could be given retrospective effect.  The hon. Minister may kindly explain 

this.  I have no hesitation in supporting this Bill.
