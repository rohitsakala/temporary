 It is very good to have autonomy of such 

institutions.  But I am not sure whether total autonomy is very good for any of the 

institutions or a person even.  I would only express some apprehensions about this 

Bill.    First  of  all  is  that  the  formation  of  the  Board  itself  is  fallacious.    So,  how 

come  the  Board  can  appoint  the  persons?    In  case,  some  illegally,  irregularity, 

corruption  or  nepotism  goes  on  in  this  Board,  how  would  the  Board  be 

accountable?    This  is  my  first  apprehension.    How  will  all  these  20  institutes  be 

upgraded  and  taken  as  institutes  of  national  importance?    The  educational  parity 

should  be  there.    How  are  we  going  to  do  it?    I  think,  only  Coordination  forum 

cannot  do  it.    Everybody  has  said  about  the  students'  fees.    That  is  also  my 

apprehension.    Who  is  going  to  decide  the  fee  structures?    The  Bill  says  that  the 

Board will be responsible for the fee structure.  But, the contribution of the Central 

Government or whatever budget is there, that will be decided by the Board.  That 

means, the budget should not be same for all 20 institutes and the fee structure will 

also be different in all these institutes whereas the entrance exam will be same for 

all.  I would like to have some clarification on that.
