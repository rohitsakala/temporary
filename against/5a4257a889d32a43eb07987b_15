  This Bill is not a progressive one 

and rather it is a regressive one.  The Government's intention is not to bring more 

workers  under  the  ambit  of  the  Factories  Act  but  to  remove  them  from  the 

protection of the Factories Act.  This Act really requires substantial amendments in 

this  era    because  first,  outsourcing  is  increasing  in  an  alarming  way;  second, 

privatisation is taking place in a big way; and third, growth of unorganised sector is 

another  big  challenge.    The  priority  in  economic    reforms  is  money  first,  market 

second,  machinery  third  and  man  last.    The  trade  unions  throughout  the  country 

were  demanding  a  comprehensive  improvement  in  the  Factories  Act  giving 

emphasis on health and safety.    In economic reforms also due consideration has 

not been given to the interests of the working classes.   The Government does not 

want the working class to raise its voice and it has not consulted the trade unions. 

This kind of ill- motivated and anti- labour actions will be fought and defeated by 

the working class in our country.
