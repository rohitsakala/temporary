  Education  is  a  tool  to  create  a  new  society.    I  would 

bring it to the notice of the  Minister of HRD that we have given this status to so 

many  institutions.  What  is  the  state  of such  institutions?    In  our  State  there  was 

one Regional Engineering College in Calicut.  The Government changed that REC 

into an NIT.  But the rank of this college has come down because the Government 

of  India  gave  some  assurance  to  give  more  money,  more  faculty  and  more 

technological advancement in such institutions but that did not happen.  How can 

such institutions survive without proper funding at proper time?  As we go through 

the  Budget, we see that  95 per  cent  of  the  money  goes  to these  institutions.   But 

the number of students studying in these elite institutions is very meager.  But the 

majority  of  students  are  studying  in  the  State  Universities  and  other  educational 

institutions.    Some  of  the  State  level  institutions  are  functioning  better  than 

national institutes.  I would request the Minister to look into State level institutions 

also.    The  rate  of  suicides  among  the  students  is  increasing  even  in  higher 

educational institutions in our country.  This is a serious concern.  We should take 

strong action against people concerned.  Mushroom growth of private institutions 

is  very  alarming.    There  is  a  complaint  of  harassment  of  students  in  all  private 

institutions.  So, I would request the hon. Minister to look into this matter and do 

the needful in this regard.
