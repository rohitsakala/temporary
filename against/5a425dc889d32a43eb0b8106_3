 

I  appreciate  the  hon.  Minister  that  he 

essentially  brought    in  the  amendments  proposed  and  passed  by  House  of  Elders 

before the two Houses. Aadhaar is a very essential issue. This shows how we are 

moving from a state of affairs where in most of the cases citizens are required to 

comply voluntarily, we are trying to make it compulsory. Clause 33, only demands 

a  clear  definition  of  national  security.  What  is  the  problem  in  defining  the  word 

'national  security'  or  having  the  words  proposed  'public  emergency'  and    'in  the 

interest  of  the  public  safety' then  what  is the objection?  you  are  saying  to  have  a 

Oversight  Committee,  and  they  have  proposed  for  CVC  and  CAG.    Both  are  the 

Constitutional  Bodies.  This  House  must  agree  with  what  has  been  recommended 

by the Rajya Sabha and we should reject what the hon. Minister is proposing.
