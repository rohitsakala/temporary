    we  have  a  lot  of  institutions  under  the  petroleum ministry  but  the  functioning  of  such  institutions  is  not  good    recently  the ministry  has  appointed  a  permanent  director  in  one  of  the  institutions    it  is  a welcome step  only when we strive to strengthen our own industry we can meet the challenges  the first institute established in this area in 1960 is indian institute of  petroleum  dehradun  uttarakhand  with  technical  support  of  the  csir uttarakhand  the second institute came into being in 2008 in rai bareilly uttar pradesh by an act of parliament  as far as the board of governors is concerned we do not have representation from the ongc oidb and others institutions  the government is looking for the merger of all the oil companies to form a bigger oil company    i  would  request  the  government  to  admit  this  institute  under  the  jv  but recently we have had many complaints about this joint venture  it included incidence  of  bribe  capitation  fee  and  so  on    this  led  to  the  subversion  of  the admission process  i would request the minister to look into this matter personally especially  about  the  rajiv  gandhi  institute    besides  i  would  also  request  the minister to start one such institute in cochin as there are many major institutions like hpcl bpcl and the petronet is also there in cochin
