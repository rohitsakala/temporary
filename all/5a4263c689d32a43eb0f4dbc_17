  i  understand  that  the caste  census  has  been  submitted  to  the  government  but  unfortunately  it  has  not been released  i would request the government to release the caste census at the earliest    my  appeal  to  the  government  is  that  it  should  take  stringent  action against  those  erring  officials  who  take  little  or  no  interest  in  ensuring  that vacancies reserved for obc are duly filled  after setting up of this commission the power of the states is intended to be withdrawn in respect of inclusion of castes in the backward class list  my considered view is that the consent of the states is to be taken on this vital issue  there is an imperative need to include at least one lady  member  on  the  commission    reservation  must  be  made  for  obcs  to  the higher judiciary as also to higher positions in the psus  the government should stipulate  a  time  frame  for  filling  in  the  vacancies  reserved  for  obcs  in  various departments and undertakings  a time frame is to be fixed for filling vacancies in the commission arising due to reasons like retirement death etc  dr  pritam  gopinath  munde  it  is  a  very  important  issue  and hence  i  would  like  to  request  you  to  kindly  allow  me  to  speak  and  give  enough time  first  of  all  i  would  like  to  thank  our  hon  prime  minister  narendra  modi and social justice and empowerment minister shri thanwarchand gehlotji million times for this historic decision of granting the constitutional status to the national commission  for  obcs  my  father  and  other  obc  leaders  fought  for  the  issue                                                             original in marathi related  to  the  obcs  relentlessly  throughout  their  lives  and  it  is  because  of  them that  today  government  is  taking  this  historic  decision  today  we  have  been discussing the pros and cons of the possible impact of this decision some people have apprehensions that it would not be beneficial for our federal structure and the states rights would get affected but i dont think so on the contrary we can see that  in  some  states  some  castes  and  identified  as  obcs  but  the  same  castes  are notified  as  scs    sts  in  some  other  states  the  kalelkar  committee  and  mandal commission  were  the  foundation  stones  for  granting  constitutional  status  to  the ncbc  we  should  also  go  for  caste  based  census  if  we  do  not  know  about  the exact figures and data reservation for obcs in not a mercy but it is our right so it is requested to collect the necessary data regarding obcs at last i would like to congratulate  the  thank  government  of  maharashtra  for  creating  a  special  obc department for the development and upliftment of obcs
