  today biotechnology  is not  a  success story  in the field  of agriculture  alone but  it is playing a  big  role  whether  it  is the field of medicine clean energy or any other field  i hope that by establishing this regional centre in our country especially in my state haryana which will be one of the largest in asia our scientist will be able to take the research to that level where even the foreign scientist would be eager to participate in it  the provision of the bill  reveals  that  only  an  allocation  of  rs  25  crore  annually  will  be  made  for  the centre  i would like to know from the hon minister whether this money would be given  solely  out  of  the  consolidated  fund  of  india  or  unesco  is  also  going  to contribute to the funding and if so what will be its contribution  if no contribution is being made from unesco then there is a need to enhance the allocation atleast upto rs 100 crore because the fund is totally dependent on the contribution from the  consolidated  fund  of  india    i  hope  that  all  the  research  content  and  product coming  out  of  the  regional  center  should  be  patented  in  our  country    as  far  as students  undertaking  research  at  the  center  are  concerned  there  should  be  a provision to the effect that they should be bound to work for the country for at least 10 years and they should not join the services of any foreign company during this period  i would urge that an amendment should be brought to include at least two members from lok sabha and one from rajya sabha in the governing body of this center because it would ensure that public representatives are there to monitor the spending of funds from the public exchequer
