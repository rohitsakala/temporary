 the main objective of this bill is to declare  the  indian  institutes  of  management  to  be  the  institutes  of  national importance  the other objective is to give the power to these institutions to award mba  and  phd  degrees  instead  of  post  graduate  diploma  in  management  and fellow programmes  another objective is to give autonomy to these institutions    this  is  really  a  very  welcome  step    in  last  three  years  of  nda  rule  the government of india has taken a decision to set up seven iims  the sixth iim is being  established  at  visakhapatnam  in  the  state  of  andhra  pradesh  in  my constituency  as  per  the  andhra  pradesh  reorganization  act  the  board  of governors are being independent and five members of the board of governors are going to be alumnimembers  i think this is one of the very good initiatives taken as far as the formation of the board of governors is concerned  social inclusion is also  taken  care  of  as  scst  faculty  members  are  being  included  in  the  board  of governors  similarly women members are also included  i would like to foresee an anomaly  in addition to iims which are being formed as societies which are giving only diplomas there are private institutes in the country like the prestigious isb  hyderabad  xlri  mdi  spjmr  imt  and  kg  somaiya  institute  of management    they  also  give  only  diplomas    when  iims  start  giving  degrees what will happen to these institutions  we should be able to remove this anomaly  i  would  like  to  suggest  that  every  iim  should  have  an  incubation  centre  to encourage  the  students  coming  up  with  bright  ideas  to  become  entrepreneurs    after  the  bifurcation  of  andhra  pradesh  the  ministry  of  hrd  was  very  kind enough to already sanction five institutes  still there are two institutions to come up as per the andhra pradesh reorganization act namely establishment of tribal university  and  establishment  of  central  university  that  are  pending    i  would request the hon minister to take the decision at the earliest
