  since  the  nabard  has been created by an act of parliament further increase on the capital can be done with the consultation of rbi or it has to come to the parliament  that is my first question  government wants to have more employment particularly in rural areas  we  should  really  encourage  the  rural  industries  by  infusing  more  funds  to nabard  now the development is entirely lopsided  so therefore to bridge the gap  between  these  urban  and  rural  areas  more  funds  may  be  given  to  the nabard  besides nabard bank may come forward to develop the backward areas  of  venkatagiri    we  have  only  one  important  lifeline  ie  telugue  ganga which is really starved of the funds  perhaps the nabard bank could give more loans for this particular project of telugue ganga  presently rural infrastructure particularly  roads  drainages  and  community  halls  etc    are  grossly  inadequate  similarly  i  would  request  the  government  to  give  a  roadmap  so  that  they  could improve  the  agricultural  income  yearbyyear    the  government  of  india  should come  forward  to  give  more  funds  to  nabard  so  that  connectivity  and  internet services  could  be  given  more  in  the  villages  i  would  also  suggest  that  the nabard should come in a big way so that the cooperative banks and the central cooperative banks could be protected  as i was telling earlier the loan pattern is lopsided  i would suggest that since it is a national wealth it could be distributed amongst all sections of the people as per the pro rata of the population
