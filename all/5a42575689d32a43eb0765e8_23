  as  many  as  22  hon members  have  put  forth  their  very  good      view  points  on the future of  20  indian institutes  of  management    i  really  thank  them  all  for  supporting  this  bill  members of all the parties have spoken in favour of autonomy of  these institutes  this  clearly  indicates  that our  country  has  been progressing  and  this also  sends  a clear message to our countrymen in this regard  now the world could see that we have taken an initiative for providing autonomy to these institutes in real sense  as i said earlier we must trust our best brains and our best institutes  these institutes have proved time and against that they are the institutes of excellence  when they are institutes of excellence we must accord them the status of institutes of national importance    as  i  said  there  will  be  a  parliamentary  accountability    setting  the system  is  the  issue    we  must  set  the  system  in  order  and  then  things  roll  out automatically    today  other  universities  have  become  famous  because  they  are independent  and  autonomous  and  that  is  the  basic  strength  of  our  educational institutes  to  survive  and  flourish    i  am  very  sure  with  this  historic  decision  we will  really  make  a  change  and  our  iims  will  go  to  the  next  level  and  the  whole education sector will aspire to be more quality oriented  regarding research what was happening earlier  it is because the fellowships of iims were not regarded by many as phds and that was the problem and therefore there were less students for phds  to  become  fellows    now  the  research  will  be  here    the  research management  is  very  important  because  it  is  changing  world  and  we  will  get  that research now based in india done in india and used in india and world over also  that  is  the  basic  thing    and  this  is  the  vision  of  prime  minister    he  wants  to make  a  difference  and  give  real  autonomy  to  the  higher  educational  quality institutes so that they flourish and reach to their optimum  now i will come to the other  issues    as  for  higher  education  finance  agency  hefa  it  has  started functioning  higher education finance agency will put in nearly three billion dollars in the  next  three  years  into  the  higher  education  sector  to  essentially  upgrade  and create  new  world  class  research  infrastructure    that  is  the  aim  with  which  the higher  education  finance  agency  will  be  working    rs  2  crore  is  given  under rusa to good colleges and rs20 crore to good universities  the government has invested  in  rusa  more  than  rs4000  crore  and  it  has  resulted  in  good development  of  infrastructure   technical  education  quality  improvement programme  has  three  phases    the  third  phase  is  all  about  hilly  states  northeastern  states  andaman  and  the  socalled  earlier  bimaru  states  odisha jharkhand madhya pradesh rajasthan uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal  it is a rs2800 crore worth programme  imprint is a research initiative in which we  ask  proposals  in  10  domain  areas  from  all  the  professionals  working  people students  teachers  and  faculties  from  everywhere    the  government  has  received 1500    proposals  and  out  of  which  200  have  been  finalized    the  government  is going to give rs600 crore and it has already started rolling out and the research is on  uchhatar avishkar yojana is relating to industryacademia interaction  many people  talked  about  incubation  centres    incubation  centres  are  there  in  the  iims iits and in all these higher learning institutes  we have also started one proposal of gyan where 600 professors from 58 countries had come last year and each one conducted  a  course  here  by  remaining  here  for  23  weeks    that  has  benefited hugely  the  students  and  the  teachers  this  year  800  foreign  professors  from  60 counties  are  coming  here    this  type  of  exchange  was  needed  and  that  is happening  we  are  recording  it  also    these  courses  will  be  available  on swayam also  so there are many number of initiatives of quality improvement  the  cabinet  will  soon  take  a  decision  about  the  world  class  universities    10 institutes in public sector and 10 in private sector will be today called as institutes of eminence but after certain time we aspire that in a decade they will acquire the ranking of the first 200 and then they will also go up in the first 100  to address the issue of faculty we have to imbibe and inculcate the teachership    through  variable  packages  we  want  to  attract  the  good  faculties    we  are also  attracting  best  of  the  indian  researchers  who  are  doing  research  work  in foreign countries  as there will be more and more people returning to the country there  will  be  more  and  more  people  available  as  faculties    this  is  how  we  are going ahead and the faculty issue will be done away with  regarding the issue of expenditure i would like to inform that in 201314 it was rs284 crore in 201415 it was rs320 crore in 201516 it was rs460 crore in 201617 it was rs722 crore and in 201718 it is going to be rs1030 crore this is the progression of the expenditure   the  hon member  also  mentioned that  there  are 14  institutes  which do  not  have  directors  posted    however  there  are  only  four  institutes  where  the post  is  vacant    so  far  as  fees  is  concerned  let  me  be  very  clear  that  no  merit student  or  a  student  who  is  eligible  for  admission  will  be  denied  education anywhere    that  is  the  affirmative  action  which  the  government  has  promised  for  this  scholarship  meritcummeans  scholarship  and  earn  while  you  learn schemes are also there  we will ensure that no genuine student loses the chance of getting higher education because he does not have money  in terms of reservation it  is  available  for  student    for  faculty  reservation  the  government  has  issued specific  direction  that  we  must  make  positive  and  affirmative  action  to  fill  up scst and other reserved vacancies of faculties    with regard to board of governors there will be no role of government in selection of board of governors   it has tenure of four years and only two terms  the issue of mother tongue has come up which is quite important  this is possible but the material and conditions will have to be prepared  i feel that management institutes can understand the market forces    the bill as amended was passed
