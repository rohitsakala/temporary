   i  rise  to  support  the  atomic  energy amendment  bill  2015    i  am  of  the  view  that  this  bill  will  go  a  long  way  in making  big  contribution  in  the  field  of  nuclear  power  generation  in  the  country  when we talk about energy then we have to take rapid stride in the field of power generation  from  whatever  source  we  get  scope  to  produce  it  whether  it  is hydropower green energy like solar power or whether it is through uranium  the people  who  have  been  displaced  due  to  setting  up  of  the  tarapur  nuclear  power plant have still been suffering a lot  those people should be given accommodation facility and they should be given compensation for their land  the field of power generation  also  assumes  great  importance  from  the  view  point  of  providing employment  to  our  youth    therefore  we  have  to  work  very  fast  in  the  field  of power generation
