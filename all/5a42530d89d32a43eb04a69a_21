 the farmers who feed 125 crore people of  this  country  are  themselves  now  reeling  under  crisis    i  am  grateful  to  the government  of  india  for  allocating  rs  10  lakh  crore  for  the  farmers  for  the  first time in history  a provision of rs one lakh crore has also been made for micro irrigation  but all the amount is likely to be disbursed to these farmers in the form of loans  it seems to me that these schemes are going to further increase the loan burden of the farmers who are already badly burdened with loans  it is a matter of shame  that  a  total  number  of  12602  farmers  and  agriculture  labourers  have committed suicide even during the regime of this government  if the policies and schemes  of  subsidies  implemented  by  spending  lakhs  of  crores  of  rupees  for farmers  come  to  a  naught  in  addressing  their  problems  they  are  required  to  be changed  i think that providing crop insurance cover is more important than that of crop  loan  waiver    about  14  crore  farmers  fail  to  avail  of  the  benefits  of  new pradhan  mantri  fasal  bima  yojana  every  year  for  one  or  the  other  reason    this problem  can  be  sorted  out  by  providing  loans  to  them  at  five  per  cent  rate  of interest  and  providing hundred per cent insurance cover to all their crops instead of providing them loan interest waiver  a number of such issues can be addressed to  if  msp    is  decided  to  the  tune  of  fifty  per  cent  of  the  production  cost    more attention is required to be paid to export also as a number of schemes like make in india  startup  india  skill  india  digital  india  are  being  implemented  and  we  are about to launch several policies in order to boost the industry  the sugar industry of maharashtra is undergoing a difficult phase and hence its loan is also required to be  restructured    i  would  like  to  make  one  important  suggestion  that  if  milk banana  eggs  jaggery  and  peanuts  are  served  under  midday  meal  scheme  then not  only  14  crore  children  will  be  benefitted  but  the  farmers  will  also  get remunerative  prices  for  their  produces    moreover    interest  free  education  loan should be provided to the children of the farmers  broadly speaking if the farmers of  the  country  are  to  be  saved  their  loans  have  to  be  waived  off  completely  special attention is required to be paid to maharashtra as most of the incidents of suicides ie 4000 out of 12000 have taken place in maharashtra only
