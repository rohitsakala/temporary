     i  understand  that  the  main  idea  of the government in bringing this bill is to transfer the captive mining leases granted otherwise  through  auction  and  would  facilitate  banks  and  financial  institutions  to liquidate  stressed  assets  where  a  company  or  its  captive  mines  mining  lease  is mortgaged  i  do  understand  that  the  mines  and  minerals  act  is  with  the  central government  however  i  feel  that  before  any  action  is  taken  the  state governments  should  be  consulted  and  their  permission  should  also  be  taken because lands that are there also belong to the state governments
