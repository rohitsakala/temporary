  i  congratulate  the  hon  minister for bringing this legislation  bonus was once treated as charity or ex gratia  now it is legally having that status  minimum bonus is 833 per cent and the maximum is limited to 20 per cent  i would suggest that this maximum limit of 20 per cent should  be  substantially  increased    unfortunately human  capital  is  not  taken into consideration  properly  in  this  bill    similarly  in  our  present  payment  of  bonus act there are seven categories which are excluded from the purview of the act  i would  request  the  hon  minister  to  reexamine  that  aspect  also    at  present workers  are  dismissed  from  service  on  the  ground  of  misconduct  and  as  a  result they  are  disqualified  from  getting  bonus    so  that  clause  may  also  be  amended  moreover structural changes are needed in this regard
