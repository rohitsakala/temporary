  i  would  like  to  congratulate  the  hon minister  for  making  good  suggestions  on this  bill  and  introducing  good  schemes therein  and  for  taking  care  of  the  rural  people    but  i  think  something  more  is required to be done in this direction so that banks can be useful instruments for the large number of farmers  when the rural people approach the banks of nabard they are harassed and not treated properly because of being uneducated by the bank officials    hence  the  very  objectives  of  setting  up  such  banks  stand  defeated    i hope that such issues will be properly looked into by the government  i would like to extend thanks to the hon prime minister for providing a package of rs250300 crore to assam  but this amount is very scant  farms and land are devastated by the  flood  and land  erosion  so the  farmers should be provided  interest  free  loan and the same should also be waived off if such a situation arises
