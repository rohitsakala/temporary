  this  bill  had  been  brought  earlier  by  the upa  government  but  because  it lapsed it  has to  be  reintroduced today  both  in rajya  sabha  and  in  lok  sabha    today  the  question  arises  as  to  why  are  we supporting this bill  the earlier 1988 act had a blanket prohibition that this is a benami  transaction  defined  hereunder  and  this  cannot  be  allowed  and  this  is banned   but there  was no  detailed  legislation we  did not  know  who is going  to investigate  who is going to go after a benami transaction  so i appreciate the move  of  the  government   now we  have  proper  authorities proper investigating officers  in  initiating  investigations  the  approving  authority  an  administrator  and the adjudicating authority  few issues that i feel have created some confusion in my mind is that in section 531 which says that any person who is in violation of provisions  of  this  law  shall  be  prosecuted  with  rigorous  punishment  etc    when you say any persons the question that arises is who is that person  i hope the hon finance minister would elaborate on that  secondly and most significantly where this  government  is  consistently  talked  about  cooperative  federalism  i  do  not somehow understand why one the property is confiscated why should it vest in the central  government  and  not  in  the  respective  state  governments  where  those properties are today situated
