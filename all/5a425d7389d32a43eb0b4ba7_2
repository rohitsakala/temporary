 i would thank the hon minister for bringing this bill    the  government  has  overhauled  the  entire  procedure  and  bring  in  great amount of transparency therein  the government has made a provision to ensure that no assets can be transferred without auction  the government has also made a provision  that  if  the  tribals  are  impacted  adversely  then  they  will  be  given  all possible  help    this  will  no  more  happen  that  their  lands  are  acquired  and  they have  to  leave  the  forests    i  would  like  to  place  a  very  practically  point    after floods  the  land  of  farmer  is  filled  with  sand  and  the  land  does  not  remain cultivable  nor  can  the  farmer  clean  his  land  by  removing  that  sand    the government  should  made  a  provision  that  the  farmer  should  have  right  on  that sand filled land for 13 years till the land becomes cultivable again  as of now if the farmer takes out even a pan of sand  from his field then the process of mining sets in  the local officers also start exploiting him  the government should think over this issue
