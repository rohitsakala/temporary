 i must admit with great pride that this is one bill that our state maharashtra is fully prepared for  we have trained a lot of  people  and  our  software  is  ready    my  first  pointed  question  to  the  hon finance  minister  is  everywhere  data  proves  that  wherever  gst  has  been implemented there have been hiccups  presently as the sectorwise growth rate is  declining  so  how  is  this  going  to  hit  our  gdp  at  this  stage    the  second question is about fdis  i would like to ask what would be the repercussions on fdis    parliamentary  powers  are  being  given  to  the  council    it  was  quite  a worrisome  situation  that  first of  all  parliament  is  the  supreme  authority  in  this country  to  make  legislations    these  are  constitution  amendments  that  we  are making  has  really  the  government  thought  it  through    the  second  most important  point  is  the  data  privacy    crores  of  data  is  going  to  be  generated every day  what precautionary measure is the government taking so that none of this data will ever be leaked  next is compensation to states  if there is an economic  crisis  are  the  luxury  items  going  to  be  good  enough  to  pay  for  the compensation  but in the bill there is no clarification as to what the roadmap is  going  to  be      another  problem  that  is  going  to  come  through  with  gst  is compliance  there are 36 registrations that people will have to go through  if i am doing business in maharashtra punjab and karnataka i will have to register in three different places  the soul of the bill is to make things simplified  i am more worried about it because more and more automotive machines are going to come    what  is  going  to  happen  to  the  jobs    there  is  going  to  be  a  serious crisis    as  far  rules  and  regulations  are  concerned    i  would  urge  him  that  he could  get  these  rules  and  regulations  quickly  because  still  there  is  no  clarity about  gst  in  people    there  have  been  a  lot  of  changes  through  the  council which  are  not  in  the  public  domain    the  other  very  important  point  is  about gst composition levy because the benefits of this composition levy have not been extended to the small service providers  i urge the government to look at the gst composition levy  i would also urge the hon minister to look at the taxation  of  work  contract  and  rethink  of  it    now  i  would  come  to  input  tax credit availability  so why the government is not giving this input tax credit  this directly affects the telecommunication towers and the pipeline  if this tax benefit  is  not  going  to  go  to  these  common  people  then  what  is  the  point  of having all these great programmes like digital india ujwal india and all these infrastructure  projects    in  that  case  the  cost  of  all  this  will  be  given  to  the consumers  this is also a very important point which is going to hurt the poor people of this country
