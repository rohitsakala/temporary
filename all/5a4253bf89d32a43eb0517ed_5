  i  would  like  to  place  on  record certain factual things so far as the ministry of external affairs is concerned  it is time for sincere appreciation for the hon minister of external affairs for handling various  issues  concerning  the  ministry  of  external  affairs    i  would  also  like  to place  on  record  that  the  hon  prime  minister  saw  that  the  agreement  which  was signed  between  the  two  heads  of  the  states  need  to  be  respected  and  honoured this  will    definitely  send  a  very  positive  signal  not  only  to  the  people  of  our country but also the people of world at large  the bill is going to serve a lot in the national interest  let me come to some of the critical observation which we must be extremely cautious about it  the first issue is the security issue  i am a victim in  my  constituency  because  of  certain  illegal  immigrants  by  bangladeshi    this needs to be taken into account  unless we look at the security issue we may be a victim tomorrow  i urge the hon minister to look into it  another important factor which i would like to urge upon is the very bonafideness of the bangladesh people who will take citizenship of india  it is extremely possible that there will be a lot of claimants who are not bonafide  so we have to have checks and balance in the system  to  ensure  that  the  bonafideness  of  the  people  of  bangladesh  so  that  india does  not  face  problems  tomorrow  we  have  to  prepare  a  blue  print  for  a  timebound development of all the enclaves which come to our fold
