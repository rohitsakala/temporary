  the  majority  of  tax  payers  are  senior citizens in the income slab of rs 5 to 10 lakh  the rate of income tax is 20 per cent  in  this  slab    this  should  be  reduced    a  large  number  of  notices  were  sent after  demonetization    i  want  to  know  from  the  hon  minister  about  the  total number of notices sent after demonetization and the number of notices cleared out of them and the time by which the pending notices are likely to be cleared because there  is  acute  shortage  of  manpower in our  income  tax department   the  revenue secretary of the government himself was of the view that by slashing the corporate tax from 30  to 25  the government is likely to incur a loss of about rs 95000 crore  annually  as  a  result    how  the  government  is  going  to  make  up  this  loss  when we talk of waiving of farmers loan then the hon minister himself gives in writing  that  they  asked  the  rbi  about  the  same  but  the  rbi  is  not  in  favour  of waiving of these loans  the government says that after the gst comes in force a major portion of the revenue receives from it would be provided to the states who are likely to suffer losses as a result  today haryana has a debt burden of more than  rs  80000  crore  on  it    whether  the  government  would  provide  any alternative benefit to our state  no funds has been provided in the budget for the construction of the sutlejyamuna link  whereas the supreme court has given a ruling  that  the  central  government  should  complete  its  construction  work  therefore  the  government  should  provide  funds  in  the  budget  so  that  the construction work completes by the end of 2017  the credit card limit at the rate of 4 per cent is rs 3 lakh  the government should increase it to rs 3 lakh without collateral guarantee and rs 8 lakh at the rate of 4 per cent in order to strengthen the economic condition of our farmers  shrimati hemamalini  the efforts which our government has been making to prevent tax evasion and black money would be before us in the coming years    the  public  of  entire  country  has  extended  their  support  to  the demonetization move of the government  the digital financial transaction is fast becoming  the  part  of  the  life  of  our  people    so  far  191crore  people  have downloaded  the  bhim  app  for  the  purpose    i  am  a  member  of  parliament  from mathura  i want special fund for the development of my constituency  mathura is the city of lord krishna  devotees from within the country and abroad visit there in large numbers   the  ambience  around mathura  city  is not very  pleasing so  we need  funds  for  beautification  of  the  city    places  like  84  kosh  parikrama  and goverdhana parikrama are there  we need to beautify these places so that people could  feel  the  touch  of  spirituality  there  and  for  this  we  need  a  huge  amount  of money  we need to set up solid waste management plants in the religious cities to keep them neat and clean  we need to provide wifi facility in some major temples complexes  there    there  should  be  deployment  of  religious  tourism  police  force there  besides  the  normal  police  force    i  want  to  set  up  a  krishna  theme  park  in mathura  and  for  this  i  need  funds  and  i  hope  that  the  finance  ministry  would provide  me  the  same  for  the  purpose    we  need  set  up  a  kendriya  vidyalaya  in mathura for the education of girl child  a large number of personnel paramilitary forces like bsf and crpf are posted in mathura  i therefore demand for setting up  three  kendriya  vidyalayas  in  mathura  for  the  children  of  these  people  similarly we need to set up primary health centres in each and every village there  the unemployment problem is very alarming in mathura  so there is a need to set up  nonpolluting  industries  there    the  condition  of  roads  and  power  is  also  not very satisfactory so i need funds to improve the situation  similarly fund should also be provided for the cleansing  of the river yamuna the agricultural sector is very important for the nations growth  i would request the hon finance minister to revisit the definition of agricultural income under the income tax act as a few agricultural  activities  are  not  covered  under  this  definition    i  belong  to  film industry    it  gives  me  immense  pleasure  to  know  that  the  bollywood  is  doing  so well    all  over  the  world  people  are  so  crazy  about  our  hindi  films  as  also  the artists  it is so wonderful to know that the government also earns crores of rupees from this industry  but there are some sad scenarios also  we need to think about those  actors  who  have  lost  their  stardom    i  am  talking  about  technicians  like camera  man  light  man  sound  assistant  dress  assistant  etc    who  work  for  24 hours  behind  the  camera    their  worklife  is  very  limited    these  people  need social  security  and  benefits  in  the  form  of  government  aid  to  help  them  so  that they  can  live  with dignity   so i  would request the  government  to do  something about  it    my  humble  suggestion  is  that  the  government  should  give  the  film industry the status of industry  lastly i want to talk about the performing artists  these performing artists are actually the brand ambassadors of our indian art and culture worldwide  but these treasurers of our culture receive no benefit from the government for their dedication towards spreading art and culture  i would once again  humbly  request  the  government  not  to  levy  taxes  on  the  income  of  these performing  artists  with  the  kind  of  taxes  that  are  levied  on  other  business  and financial  institutions   these  artists  live  a  very  humble  life  and  their  earnings  are not as high as the bollywood artists  so for them art is just a sadhana
