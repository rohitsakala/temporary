  the  condition  of  small  banks  has deteriorated  due  to  the  npas    in  the  process  to  bring  about  improvement  five subsidiary  banks  of  the  state  bank  ie  state  bank  of  hyderabad  state  bank  of bikaner and jaipur state bank of mysore state bank of patiala and state bank of travancore have  been  merged into the  state  bank of  india   it  is  my  request that the government may endeavour to set up the branches of the state bank in those rural  areas  where  its  branches  are  not  available    with  regard  to  the  charges imposed by the sbi i would request the government that it should be waived for the  common  man    i  believe  that  if  the  smaller  banks  are  merged  npas  will certainly  be  reduced  and  we  will  get  success  in  recovering      the  money  from  the big industrialists who are loan defaulters and who have fled the country
