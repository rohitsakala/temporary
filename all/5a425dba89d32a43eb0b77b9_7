  when  this  bill  was sent  to  the  rajya  sabha  after  having  been  passed  from  this  lok  sabha  rajya sabha considered it for a very long time and subsequently rajya sabha decided to refer it to the select committee  the select committee took a very little time and discussed  it  comprehensively  and  submitted  its  report  within  7  days  to  the  rajya sabha    i  am  happy  to  note  that  the  select  committee  has  also  suggested  certain amendments after considering the bill  the government has also agreed to those amendments  because  all  of  them  are  good  provisions  and  the  government  was neither reluctant to accept them in the past nor is a government hesitant to accept them  today    today  one  of  the  hon  member  has  suggested  an  amendment    i would like to urge the hon member that only the addition of the word exclusive is  not  going  to  make  a  significance  difference  to  the  bill    the  original  intent  of that word is fully contained in the provisions of the bill  law has its own place but the  willpower  of  the  government  in  implementing  the  law  placed  even  a  greater role    this  government  wants  to  empower  the  state  governments  further  and  it wants that the latter should function with rising accountability  if we have created a  district  mineral  foundation  for  spending  the  money  for  the  welfare  of  the persons displaced due to mining and for the mining area as a whole then we have to show our faith in the state governments  the guidelines required to be given to the state governments have found place in the provisions of the bill and the state governments will be further requested if the need arises  therefore i would like to say  that  the hon member  that the  original  intent of  his  amendment  is very  much contained  in  the  provisions  of  the  bill    therefore  he  should  withdraw  his amendment  i would request the house that this amendment bill which has arrived in modified form after having been amended by the rajya sabha is certainly going to  bring  radical  changes  in  the  field  of  mining  encourage  the  sector  create employment opportunity in the country increase the investment put an end to the corruption    in  the  allocation  of  mining  and  increase  the  transparency    i  would request the house that these amendments find the consent of all the members   the motion was adopted and the amendments were agreed to
