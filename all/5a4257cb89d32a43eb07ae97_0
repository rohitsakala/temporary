  the  rationale  for  this  legislation  is  the  ever increasing  number  of  commercial  disputes  that  crop  up  as  a  result  of  increasing economic activity in the country  it is a fact that there is a huge pendency of high value  commercial  disputes  the  reduction  of  which  is  necessary  to  make  india  a desired  a  more  attractive  and  a  more  favoured  destination  for  investors  to  do business  in    the  quick  adjudication  of  commercial  disputes  would  faster  the growth of trade and commerce   it is a regrettable that some ouf our laws remain archaic  the civil procedure code is of the year 1908  the need of the laws is to evolve with the changing times  the subordinate judiciary is burdened with about three crore pending cases  the main aim of creating the commercial courts is not only reduction of the pendency of suits already filed but also to quickly dispose of the new cases that would be filed  our party has reservations on two points in the bill   one  is  with  regard  to the  specified  value  as defined  under  section 2  1i for  a  commercial  dispute  as  per  this  section  is  rs  1  crore    we  want  that  to  be enhanced to rs 10 crore at the least  under the provisions of sections 19 and 20 of  the  bill  cast  an  obligation  on  the  state  government  to  provide  infrastructural facilities    the  centre  should  provide  substantial  funds  for  the  establishment  of these infrastructural facilities  in order to fulfill the objective of quick disposal of pending cases the vacancies in the judiciary at all levels should be filled up  the quality of the legal education imparted in india is a matter of grave concern   the mushroom growth of substandard law colleges should be curbed
