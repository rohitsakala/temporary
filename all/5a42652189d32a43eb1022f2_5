  the  gst  is  definitely  a  progressive  tax  regime and everybody is enthusiastically waiting for it  we have been talking about one tax  one  nation    but  i  would  like  to  ask  as  to  why  not  one  administration  instead of having two administrations it is time to have a  federal gst service on the lines of the all india services  the entire success of gst depends on the gst network  this is entirely dependent on the software  hence i would like to know as  to  what  is  the  preparedness  of  the  government  to  launch  the  software  and hardware    while  changing  the  name  of  central  board  of  excise  and  customs  to the  central  board  of  indirect  taxes  and  customs  an  arbitrary  decision  regarding tax base of above rs 15 crore and below 15 crore has been taken  a lot of tax base  has  been  shifted  to  the  states    i  feel  the  cbec  officers  who  are  recruited through upsc are on par with ias ifs and ips in competence but they are now rendered unemployed or rather underemployed  so this will be a callous misuse of manpower  another interesting point is regarding vigilance  cbi and cvc will have  jurisdiction  if  any  malpractice  is  perpetrated    but  the  state  governments will resist the entry of the cbi and cvc into their jurisdiction  if we take care of human  manpower  one  tax  one  nation  one  administration  some  vigilance mechanism  gst  preparedness  arbitrariness  of  the  tax  base  of  rs  15  crore between  the  centre  and  states  i  feel  this  will  be  a  smooth  unfolding  in  future  otherwise  unnecessary  problems  will  be  created  between  the  centre  and  states which  we  would  not  be  able  to  solve  very  easily    even  the  gst  council  also cannot address all these problems    dr  a  sampath  as  regards  the  taxation  laws  amendment  bill 2017 first i would be referring to the last pages of the bill and then i will come to the initial pages  i have certain reservations about the delegation of powers as it is not of a normal character  the delegated powers are unchecked powers and if this august  house  does  not  take  cognizance  of  the  matter  then  it  will  be  a  financial frankenstein    along  with  other states  my  state  of  kerala  is  also  suffering  in  the name of international treaties  if we are talking about cooperative federalism the government  of  india  should  take  into  confidence  all  the  state  governments  having  compared  the  international  prices  of  crude  oil  to  the  prices  of  domestic lpg cylinder the consumers are bound to feel that they are being pickpocketed  apart  from  addressing  to  these  issues  the  government  of  india  should  take initiatives to fill up around one million vacancies including two lakhs of vacancies in the railways also  if the industries are having a free say and if the cess levied on the consumption of water is being withdrawn the people will be at the mercy of the corporates  moreover magic should be included in the list of performing arts and taxexemption should also be given to it  lastly i would beg the government to give adequate loans to the traditional sector for their sustenance and livelihood
