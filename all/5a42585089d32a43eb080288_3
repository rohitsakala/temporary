    hon  members  would  recall  that  during  the  last  year when  similar  objections  were  raised  at  the  time  of  consideration  of  the  finance bill 2016 i had observed that as per rule 219 the primary object of a finance bill is  to  give  effect  to  the  financial  proposals  of  the  government  there  is  no  doubt about it  at the same time this rule does not rule out the possibility of inclusion of nontaxation proposals  therefore i have accepted this  the finance bill may contain nontaxation proposals also    now  another  thing  is  no  doubt  every  effort should  be  made  to  separate  taxation  measures  from  other  matters    it  should  be done  but as has been very widely explained by the finance minister i did not say the  thing  again  and  again    so  incidental  provisions  can  be  made  that  is  why keeping  in  view  that  rule  219  does  not  specifically  bar  inclusion  of  nontaxation proposals in a finance bill i rule out the point of order
