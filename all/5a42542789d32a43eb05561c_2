  it  is  a  good  step  but  i agree with an earlier speaker who was telling that it is a colonial decision which we have  taken    definitely  it  reduces  the  burden  of  the  high  court  and  the  litigants will also benefit enormously from the point of view of distance from the point of view  of  fees  and  all  other  points  of  view    but  in  the  long  run  the  power  of  the original jurisdiction of the civil cases may be taken away from the high court and given to the district courts so that the high court could focus on the appeals and writ  jurisdiction    the  pecuniary  jurisdiction  should  be  uniform  throughout  the country    while  the  property  appreciation  and  currency  devaluation  is  uniform throughout  the  country  raising  it  in  the  case  of  delhi  high  court  only  would  be unfair
