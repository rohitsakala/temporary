 our parliament is the symbol of unity in diversity    the  new  law  gst  is  also  the  symbol  of  unity  in  diversity    the historic goods and services tax bill 2017 has been introduced  we welcome and  support  this  bill    under  the  central  gst  we  have  made  slabs  for  each commodity with varying rates but the central gst would still levy one per cent more tax and the burden will be automatically transferred to the consumer  the government  should  explore  some  alternative  and  amend  this  in  this  regard  what are the reasons for not bringing the consumable alcohol under the gst petroleum products have also not been covered under the gst  but this is good a proposal
