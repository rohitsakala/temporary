  i  support  this  legislation    i  wish  to  place  on record the following suggestions  there should be a district level forum which will help  small  and  midlevel  allottees    the  constitution  of  the  appellate  tribunal under  chapter  vii  should  compulsorily  have  one  technical  member    the promoters  should  ensure  that  no  substandard  materials  are  used  as  against  high quality  materials  and  the  promoters  should  be  liable  to  pay  compensation  regarding  noncompletion  if  the  promoters  are  unable  to  give  possession  of  the apartmentflatbuilding  within  the  contractual  period  the  promoter  should  be blacklisted   the  compensation should be  at least 10  per  cent  over  and  above  the housing  loans  of  banks  and  financial  institutions    there  should  be  a  proper garbage disposal and waste management option within the housing complex  floor or roof heights are decreasing day by day  such kind of a low height is not healthy in terms of air circulation and other issues  there should be a minimum height of at least 1213 feet  my humble submission is that the proposed law much strike a balance so that it does not kill the investment in this sector
