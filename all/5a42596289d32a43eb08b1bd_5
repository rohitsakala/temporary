  on  behalf  of  telugu  desam  party  we wholeheartedly support this bill and congratulate the minister for bringing forward a lot of historical bills like the ones on mental healthcare etc  before aids there is  another  condition  which  is  called  hiv  positive    once  a  person  is  tested  hiv positive  for  him  to  develop  aids  it  may  take  10  years  to  20  years  and  in  some cases he may not even get aids  most of the patients of aids suffer from chronic malnutrition  and  under  nutrition    most  of  the  symptoms  and  signs  of  aids  just mimic tuberculosis  a big debate is going on whether aids is a separate disorder as  district  from  tuberculosis  or  it  has  only  to  do  with  the  sexually  transmitted diseases    if  that  is  so  let  us  call  it  sexually  transmitted  diseases  why  do  we label it separately as aids and make the patients suffer from stigma  i definitely support this bill which has excellent provisions
