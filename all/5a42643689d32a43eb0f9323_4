 i would say that the right of children to  free  and  compulsory  education  act  2009  provides  a  justifiable  legal framework  that  entitles  all  children  between  the  age  of  six  and  fourteen  free  and compulsory  education    when  you  are  talking  about  right  to  education  is  there  a separate budget for right to education  if we have a separate budget for rte it will  be  easier  for  government  to  monitor  the  progress  of  sarva  siksha  abhiyan the  bill  of  course  deals  with  only  one  aspect  and  that  aspect  is  relating  to shortage of qualified teachers but i have full faith in the minister he has picked up one aspect which has been pending for last so many years which should have been  completed  by  2013    the  hrd  ministry  must  be  given  due  credit  for  an excellent  decision  that  they  have  taken  very  recently    the  national  council  of educational  research  and  training  ncert  is  going  to  organize  a  national achievement survey in september this year  this is a very welcome step under the present law the states do not have adequate teachers the provision to possess minimum qualification was relaxed till march 31st 2015  that date has passed two years ago  still we have an immense problem of getting hold of qualified teachers for imparting free education quality education therefore my amendment is that it cannot  control  all  these  things  at  the  union  government  level    so  allow  the respective states to take decision especially this is the right based law
