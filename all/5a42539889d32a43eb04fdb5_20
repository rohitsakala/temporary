  in  uttarakhand  by  the  undemocratic way the government has been dismantled  now the nda is committing the same sins that were started by the congress party in 1959 when they dismissed a popular government  in  kerala    in  the  sr  bommais  judgement  of  the  supreme  court court said issues of majority or minority are not matters to be determined by the government  or  for  that  matter  anywhere  else  except  the  floor  of  the  house  therefore let the floor test be conducted in the uttarakhand assembly and popular government  be  installed  there    it  is  a  shameless  assault  on  democracy  and    a blatant  violation  of  constitutional  norms    therefore  i  oppose  this  appropriation bill
