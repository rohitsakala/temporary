      there  are  some  issues which i would like to bring before the notice of the hon minister sir now more penalties have been proposed but there is every possibility that whenever there is more  proposed  penalties  in  india  it  leads  to  rentseeking  behaving  of  the  bribes therefore this point needs to be addressed auctioning will be successful only if adequate quantity and quality of the mines and minerals available is assessed sir rehabilitation and resettlement is almost worst in india particularly in the mining sector similarly about the  royalty only  onethird  is being  collected there  is no reason why only onethird of the royalty is being collected this point may also be looked into presently the coal and lignite lease holders will be depositing 25 per cent  of  their  profit  after  tax  that  is  missing  here  it  is  a  gross  injustice  to  the concerned state whatever they are supposed to deposit they should also deposit it with the state government while auctioning if the quality and quantity as i was suggesting  is  not  assessed  and  undervalued  the  state  governments  will  be  at  a loss  because  the  revenues  will  come  down  if  it  is  overvalued  the  leaseholders will  be  badly  affected  so  this  also  needs  to  be  considered  the  interest  of  the leaseholders is not at all considered when you want to bring in more investment when you want to bring in  more technology a  minimum guarantee of returns for the investors needs to be considered therefore the balancing has to be done
