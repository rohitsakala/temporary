  i  express  my  gratitude  to  the  hon minister  for  bringing  such  a  laudable  bill    large  number  of  members  have demanded the inclusion of more castes in the scheduled castes list   however first the  government  should  increase  the  reservation  quota  for  the  scheduled  castes  out  of  22  per  cent  reservation  scheduled  castes  are  getting  only  19  per  cent  similar is the case with the backward castes  out of 27 per cent reservation they are getting only 5 per cent  the congress party was in power for 5055 years but did not install a single statue of baba saheb anywhere in the country  if any party did  this  it  is  the  bjp    the  hon  prime  minister  called  a  special  session  of  lok sabha  68  years  after  independence  in  honour  of  baba  saheb  dr  bhim  rao ambedkarji  if any party has honoured scheduled castes it is the bjp  the uttar pradesh government is committing atrocities on scheduled castes
