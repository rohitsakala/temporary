 people are saying that gst will be a  game  changer  and  will  bring  immense  benefit  to  manufacturers  traders exporters  and  others  but  we  the  biju  janata  dal  on  this  side  believe  that  it would be illusory to expect too much from it   the basic advantage comes from an  amalgamation  of  nearly  oneandahalf  dozen  central  and  state  taxes    but yet  again  i  will  like  to  remind  this  house  not  to  expect  too  much  from  gst because it all depends on the revenue neutral rate that is fixed  it is now fixed at zero per cent five per cent 12 per cent 18 per cent and 28 per cent and above  it  will  be  known  only  after  the  first  year  whether  it  is  revenue  neutral  or  not  the  claim  that  the  consumer  will  benefit  due  to  less  tax  burden  is  also  very illusory  will the prices come down after implementation of this law  that is the  basic  thing  which  our  people  wanted  to  know   distinction  between  goods and  services  will  not  go  since  a  separate  rate  for  service  tax  is  also  being introduced    under  clause  1712  the  central  government  may  constitute  an authority  or  empower  existing  authority  constituted  under  any  law  as  an  antiprofiteering  measure    but  we  have  a  competition  law  and  why  should  the government  have  a  provision  in  this  bill  which  empowers  the  government  to constitute  an  antiprofiteering  authority    this  is  a  very  retrograde  step  the competition  act  of  2002  provides  for  action  against  abuse  of  dominant position   no  other  antiprofiteering  law  is  necessary   on  the  gst compensation  bill  i  have  moved  two  amendments  these  are  our  states concerns  on our persistent raising the issue of compensation this government has  come  up  with  this  bill    still  there  is  a  little  bit  of  concern    in  council odishas  case  was  not  considered  in  full  detail    odisha  brought  to  the  gst council  the  issue  relating  to  entry  tax  which  will  impact  the  amount  of compensation    dealers  in  odisha  had  challenged  the  validity  of  odisha  entry tax act 1999 in hon supreme court and dealers have been paying only 50 per cent of entry tax  as a result we have been restrained to collect the full amount  therefore it was proposed by odisha that such revenue on account of the year 201516 should  either  be  included  in  the base  year  of  201516  calculated  or  it should  be  excluded  from  calculating  the  actual  revenue  for  the  concerned subsequent  year  or  years    otherwise  the  amount  of  compensation  will  be unfairly reduced  however this proposal was not accepted in the gst council  hence justice was not done  in the near future we are expected to receive the balance  entry  tax    is  the  government  going  to  calculate  that    therefore  i would appeal  to the finance  minister to  take up this  case on our  behalf in  the council  we had also moved an amendment relating to the clean environment cess  odisha had also raised this in the council  odisha is a coalbearing state and  a  cess  is  being  collected    while  the  rates  of  royalty  have  remained unrevised the union government has enhanced the levy of clean environment cess  to  rs  400  per  tonne  in  the  union  budget  in  201617    it  has  been suggested  by  our  state  that  this  cess  should  be  renamed  as  environment  and rehabilitation cess and at least 60 per cent of such funds should be shared with the  coalbearing  states    the  remaining  40  per  cent  of  the  cess  may  go  to  the gst  compensation  fund    however  the  gst  council  has  decided  that  the entire  proceeds  of  clean  environment  cess  would  be  used  for  gst compensation    that  is  our  concern    as  far  as  the  issue  of  parliamentary oversight is concerned such oversight collapses once the power under igst is delegated to the states  this grant of power is without any accountability this is  constitutionally  not  permissible    there  would  be  multiple  registrations  for service  providers  and  that  goes  against  the  idea  of  one  nation  one  tax    this does not seem to be in the spirit of ease of doing business  west bengal has a tenancy act  now the owner of the land will come under gst  there is a case where in a roundabout way  you are bringing agriculturist into tax net  shared cropping  is  now  going  to  be  taxed  under  this  bill    punjab  had  vehemently objected to bringing agriculturist within this bill and imposing tax on him but this  objection  was not  accepted   haryana also objected  to it    items  like dairy farming  and  poultry  have  not  been  included  in  the  definition  of  agriculture  what about the land laws of west bengal odisha jharkhand punjab haryana and what about their farmers  i am not going to challenge the decision or the wisdom of the council  but it will be challenged at some point of time unless a consensus  builds  up    it  is  because  a  large  section  of  society  is  going  to  get affected when you are defining the agriculturists and bringing them under gst
