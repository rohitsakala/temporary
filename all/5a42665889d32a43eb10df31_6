 this is a welcome bill  our party supports it  i think most of us here support it  i see one significant flaw in this bill that is the sharp cutoff of rs 21000  if a person is actually having rs 21000 salary and an employer wants to punish him he can give an increment of rs 500  with the result he goes outside the slab and actually he will have a loss of  rs  20000  to  his  annual  income    i  think  the  better  proposition  is  that  if  we have  slab  on  a  sliding  scale  declining  up  to  rs  42000    so  at  a  salary  of  rs 21000 we can  have 833 percent at rs 25000 it can be seven percent and at rs 42000 it can be zero  so this will make everyone happy and there is no loss to anyone  the maximum limit that is prescribed is 20 percent  why can this not be enhanced to at least 40 percent  a lot of injustice is being done to the contract and outsourcing  employees      so  i  would  request  the  hon  minister  to  look  into  this issue
