  i  wholeheartedly  support  this  bill  to  facilitate  the setting  up  of  new  iits  and  making  them  as  institutions  of  national  importance  i would like to thank the government for fulfilling the long pending demand of the people  of  kerala  for  setting  up  an  iit  in  my  constituency  palakkad  the  most urgent need of the hour is to make iits more inclusive what are the challenges in making iits more inclusive the first one is fee hike now the iit education has become  costlier  than  education  from  some  private  institutions  so  we  need  to seriously think about this indiscriminate fee hike the second most important issue as a challenge in making iits more inclusive is the flawed reservation policy the government should ensure that the reservation policy will be strictly implemented both  in  admission  and  in  recruitment  of  faculties  in  iits  there  is  a  need  to implement  the  recommendations  of  anil  kakodkar  committee  for  improving  the quality and standard of the iits the government needs to seriously ponder over the steps to check the braindrain of iit educated students from the country
