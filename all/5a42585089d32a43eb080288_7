 this finance bill when it was presented on 1st february 2017 had 150 clauses and seven schedules  but strangely enough the finance  minister  in  his  series  of  amendments  added  33  new  clauses  and  two schedules  i do not understand why in a finance bill which is supposed to detail the  taxation  proposals  of  the  government  they  have  brought  in  the  abolition  or uniformisation  of  the  tribunals  which  have  no  relation  to  taxation  proposals directly    there  has  been  no  significant  effort  to  lower  the  taxation  rates  so  that collections could be improved  in case of income tax the government is giving up  rs15000  crore  with  small  income  tax  payers  getting  rs12500  and  it  is gaining  rs2700  crore  by  taxing  the  bracket  between  rs50  lakh  and  rs1  crore  with  regard  to  the  corporate  tax  for  companies  having  turnover  up  to  rs50 crore the tax has been reduced to 25 per cent  due to this the total tax given up is rs7200  crore    the  total  reduction  in  taxes    to  the  government  comes  to rs20000  crore    there  are  otherwise  no  major  changes  in  the  tax  rates  in  the budget    government has  given  tax  concession  with  regard  to affordable housing having  carpet  area of  30  to  60  square  meters   completion  period of  housing  has also  been  extended  from  three  to  five  years    the  other  thing  is  that  there  is  tax relief in partial withdrawal from the national pension system  this is a welcome step in the sense that those who are saving through national pension scheme will get this benefit  another good step is that the chief ministers relief fund has been exempted  from  taxes      the  government  has  given  a  long  list  of  concessions  on customs duty  some concessions relate to proposals involving change in customs duty for incentivizing value addition make in india  the government has formed this budget with the expectation that the gst would give rise to better collection  the government has increased the money for infrastructure etc  now where will the  money  come  from    the  funding  of  such  expenditure  seems  to  be  left  to  the mercy of implementation of the gst which is likely to bring in more taxes to the centre  and  states  as  also  transfer  of  resources  from  the  tax  evaders  to  the government through  demonetization   however  gst is likely to  have contractionary  effects  in  the  shortterm  particularly  in  the  year  of  imposition  thus the tax revenue is likely to fall this year  the peoples expectation was that the  income  tax  exemption  limit  would  be  raised  to  rs5  lakh  but  only  a  small concession  has  been  given  on  income  tax  the  government  has  not  given  farm loan  waiver    demonetization  did  not  turn  out  to  be  a  bonanza  as  roughly  rs15 lakh crore was demonetized and almost rs15 lakh crore has been deposited  for remonetization  the  cost  is  as  per  my  estimate  rs20000  crore    rs6500  crore extra  tax  was  generated  through  demonetization    so  demonetization  has  been  a total loss  demonetization crushed the small farmer the artisan the daily labourer and  one  day  the  government  will  have  to  pay  the  price    the  gst  is  to  be implemented  from  1st  july  2017  if  the  initial  year  of  gst  is  poor  in  revenue accruals then where will the government get the money from  the budget has a long  list  of  giveaways  and  government  programmes  in  the  context  of demonetization  hurting  the  economy  but  little  in  the  way  of  jobcreating  reform  india needs reforms to create jobs by opening itself up to global supply chains to incentivize  firms  to  grow  so  that  they  can  compete  globally  and  work  harder  to teach  skills  to  young  people    one  million  people  are  joining  the  job  market  in india  every  year    in  2015  only  135000  new  jobs  were  created  in  this  country  every year we are creating an army of the unemployed   the budget encourages companies  to  remain  small  because  they  are  giving  concessions  to  smaller companies but not to bigger companies  the budget india needed to do something to  revise  investment  since  private  investment  showed  no  signs  of  recovery    the government  is  going  for  privatization    today  the  finance  minister  announced that  he  is  going  to  disinvest  bridge  and  roof  kolkata  bharat  pumps  scooters india hindustan newsprints and eight more companies  they are destroying the basis  of  the  public  sector    i  totally  oppose  these  disinvestment  proposals  of  the government    this  budget  does  not  tell  us  how  much  black  money  government has  recovered  so  far    this  finance  bill  does  not  show  a  way    the  finance minister  has  not  laid  down  a  roadmap  by  which  he  will  be  able  to  mop  up  more resources  from  the  rich  and  give  more  relief  to  the  poor  so  that  the  economy improves
