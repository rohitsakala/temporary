 it is a reality of our country that we have so far not  been  able  to  address  the  problem  of  child  labour  properly    we  will  have  to think differently to tackle this problem because we cannot  tackle this problem by merely  enacting  legislations  we  will have  to construct  big bal  bhavans  in  each and  every  state  for  orphaned  hapless  and  destitute  children    we  should  provide them  education  in  these  bhavans  besides  imparting  them  skill  development training  this way these children will not become a burden on our country rather they could prove invaluable assets for our country in future
