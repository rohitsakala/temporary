  contribution  of  nuclear  energy  is very  less in  the  total  production of  power  in  the  country     one  of  the  reasons of adopting atomic energy is that it is cheaper  many hon members have supported nuclear power projects but many others have expressed that nuclear power can be dangerous  to  human  life    many  foreign  companies  are  likely  to  enter  into  joint venture  in  nuclear  power  projects  but  unfortunately  many  foreign  companies  are there on which question marks have been put  the french company namely areva is  a  blacklisted  company    wherever  did  this  company  work  there  were  safety issues  we are not opposed to the nuclear power project at jaitapur per se but we definitely are opposed to the location of the plant and the company through which it is proposed to be established  jaitapur falls in seismic zoneiv  the atomic fuel of  the  project  would  be  disposed  into  the  sea  which  would  result  in  increase  of marine  temperature    this  will  adversely  affect  the  marine  life    what  provisions has  the  government  made  for  the  lakhs  of  fishermen    many  scientists  have submitted a report on jaitapur project to the government  the government should consider  this  report  because  establishment  of  atomic  energy  project  at  such  a vulnerable location is not safe
