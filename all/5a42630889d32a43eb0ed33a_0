 india  has  been  recognized  world  over  as  the  it  soft  power  to  promote  this  it industry  we  provided  iiits  in  government  sector    later  on  it  was  felt  that  there should be publicprivate partnership and 20 such iiits with publicprivate partnership were  mooted  in 2010   now nearly  15 iiits  are  already  operational  in the  country  this year their students will be graduating for the first time and iiit bill provides for granting  degrees  to  their  students    but  iiit  publicprivate  partnership  mode  is  a different  mode  because  there  are  different  stakeholders    in  iiits  it  is  only  the central  government  but  in  iiitppp  it  is  the  central  government  the  state government and the private sector  so instead of amending the law we have brought this bill and i believe that this bill will be passed unanimously  we will consider all the good suggestions made in this regard
