    the gst being a consumptionbased tax  states  with  higher  consumption  of  goods  and  services  will  have  better revenues so the cooperation from state governments would be one of the key factors  for  the  successful  implementation  of  gst  one  of  the  most  significant challenges  for  successful  implementation  of  gst  is  to  have  good  it infrastructure  in  the  country  so  the  government  needs  to  work  on  that problem there is no special provision for northeastern states in spite of the fact  that  the  constitution  one  hundred  and  first  amendment  act  empowers gst council to make special provision for northeastern states there should have been a  mechanism  of  seamless  flow of  credit of  all the  taxes paid in  any state it was expected that the government will take measures to educate trade and  industries not  only  in  towns  and  cities  but  even in  far  flung  areas  of  rural india  this  has  not  been  done  any  person  doing  interstate  sales  will  not  be entitled  for  composition  scheme  in  the  northeastern  states  a  lot  of  trade happen interstate and they will be deprived of opting for composition scheme thereby a lot of hardship will faced by them they will not be able to compete with  dealers  around  the  country  antiprofiteering  clause  will  be  used  for harassment  of  trade  and  industries  there  is  no  mechanism  to  prevent  any harassment   there  are  many  objections  from  trade  associations  the government needs to redress their concerns and problems i would request the hon minister to remove the anomalies in the present bill and adopt a simplified and more beneficial law
