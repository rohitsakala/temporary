  today  we  are  discussing the astronomical rise in price of essential commodities an issue which touches all citizens  and  deeply  affects  the  weaker  and  vulnerable  sections  of  society  during the last two years the prices of all essential commodities have shot up and some of the  pulses  have  vanished  from  the  market  consequent  to  the  largescale  hoarding and  black  marketing  by  unscrupulous  profiteers  pulses  are  the  main  source  of protein and nutrition for the common man the jump in price has put pulses out of reach for the poor it is not only the pulses  the price of cereals vegetables fruits salt  sugar  dairy  products  and  every  other  item  in  the  essential  food  basket  has exorbitantly  risen  the  middleclass  in  forced  to  cut  their  daily  budget  due  to  this unprecedented jump in price the government says it is due to the adverse weather condition that such a calamitous situation has arisen and therefore the sharp decline in agriculture production that being the case what contingent measures have been taken  by  the  government  to  meet  such  an  eventuality  what  is  required  is  to enhance  investment  in  agriculture  to  extend  easy  farm  loans  to  agriculturists  at low interest and to make available quality seeds and fertilizers at reasonable cost crop  insurance  and  minimum  support  price  for  agriculture  produce  are  other important  requirements  for  stepping  up  agriculture  production  another  reason assigned  by  the  government  for  the  price  rise  is  the  escalation  in  transport  cost the  cost of  petroleum  product  was  104 dollars  per barrel it  is  now  at  40  dollar per barrel why the benefit of this sharp fall in price has not reached the masses the  government  has  taken  the  meeting  of  the  state  food  ministers  in  delhi  to evolve concrete strategy to stabilize price unless we streamline and strengthen the public distribution system across the country we will not be able to  provide man at affordable prices it is a tragedy that this government miserably failed to contain the  price  of  essential  commodities  as  to  check  food  inflation  the  food  security that we have attained over the years is facing grave threats we have had enough of rhetoric    what  we  want  is  holistic  approach  towards  agriculture  growth  and welfare of farmers inflation trajectory will depend upon how well the food supply is managed by the government in the coming months complacency will lead the farmers and the public to peril it is time to act
