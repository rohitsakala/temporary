 i have got only three quick points to mention   i would like to say that in a state like meghalaya only 30 per cent of the population has been enrolled and has been issued aadhaar cards  it is therefore not possible to  make  the  aadhaar  number  mandatory  for  meghalaya    i  would  like  to  request the minister to look into this matter and issue a separate notification for meghalaya on this issue  secondly there is a proposal for merging seven tribunals  i would request the minister to explain as to why this has been done and that too at the last moment    more  than  10000  fcras  have  been  cancelled  by  the  government  many of thes ngos belong to christian minority  i would request the minister to look into this matter and not to harass all these people for small mistakes  there is a provision of search and seizure  this provision is very dangerous in terms of tax men who have a free will to go wherever they want without any accountability
