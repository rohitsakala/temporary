  i come from mumbai and the real estate has been functioning in mumbai widely and a large population is affected by this trade  my  main  suggestion  is  that  real  estate  may  be  considered  as  an  industry  by  the government  and  it  may  be  given  the  status  of  an  industry  as  the  real  estate contributes  63  per  cent  of  indian  gdp    while  rera  will  only  regulate developers  it  should  also  be  an  authority  which  can  grant  approvals  for  projects and monitor compliance
