  i  rise  here  to  support  the  bill    the  second point  in  the  bill  is  with  respect  to  pensions  to  the  high  court  and  the  supreme court  judges  because  the  high  court  and  the  supreme  court  judges  are  coming from two streams  one is coming from the state judicial services and the other is coming  from  the  bar    the  judges  who  are  coming  from  the  bar  are  not  in  a beneficial  position  because  their  experience  at  bar  is  not  being  taken  into consideration  while  calculating  the  pension    it  took  too  long  to  correct  this anomaly  this bill is need of the hour and disparity in pension is being removed altogether    apart  from  pension  the  judges  should  enjoy  benefits  that  are  higher than  in  other  branches  of  the  government  both  due  to  the  position  of  the  office they occupy as well as to ensure their independence and fair judgment  the first principle of democracy is accountability  but it is the judiciary alone which is not accountable either to the parliament or to the executive  its accountability should be ensured  article 124 2 specifically provides that once the president appoints the executive is accountable to parliament  on the basis of that if the high court and supreme court judges are appointed then indirectly they are accountable to the public  at large   in  so  far  as  article  1242  and  article  1244  are  concerned these are the only two provisions where the constitutional provision has been made with respect to appointment and with respect to removal of the judges  but those provisions are also subject to article 368 of the constitution of india because the parliament is supreme  people of india have given this power and the parliament can  amend  it    it  cannot  be  interfered  by  the  judiciary  in  the  functioning  of  the parliament    i  would  also  request  the  hon  law  minister  to  bring  a  suitable amendment  in  the  legal  services  authority  act  because  under  this  act  this executive  function  is  being  assigned  to  the  judiciary    now  the  judiciary  is exercising  dual  function    one  is  the  judicial  function  and  the  other  one  is  the executive  function    so  this  is  high  time  we  brought  a  suitable  legislation  with respect  to  either  restoring  the  mandate  of  article  1252  by  way  of  defining  the word  consultation  or  bringing  some  suitable  amendment  like  national  judicial commission  we should being a suitable legislation by exercising the power under article 360a and amending the constitution to say that once a judge is retired there would be no reemployment either in a tribunal or anywhere
