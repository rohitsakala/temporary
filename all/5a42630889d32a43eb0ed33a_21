    i  would  like  to  thank  the  government for  envisaging  the  setting  up  of  20  iits  on  ppp  mode  keeping  in  view  the  national requirements  and  also  the  prevailing  circumstances  at  the  national  and  international level  i find that there is a great disparity between the requirement of the industry and our educational system  this bill is going to fill this gap  i would certainly like to say  that  such  institutes  will  certainly  be  able  to  churn  out  the  technicians  in  both qualitative and quantitative terms to match the pace and requirement of the progress being made in the country under the make in india programme  it is for the first time that  15  such  institutes  are  being  set  up  in  the  country  today  our  institutes  are  not research  oriented  and  if  we  make  them  research  oriented  then  certainly  it  will  be  a useful step for the country  i would like  the government to make a provision under which it is made obligatory upon the iitians  to serve for atleast 1015 years in the country before migrate to foreign countries and a bond to this effect could be made to sign  by  them    the  existing  24  institutes  should  be  linked  to  the  institutions  like drdo  isro  etc  to  benefit  these  institutes    there  is  a  need  to  establish  defence institutes in ujjain also
