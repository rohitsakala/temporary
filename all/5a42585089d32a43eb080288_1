  my  serious  objection  to  the finance  bill  2017  is  under  article  110 and  117  and  rule  2191  of  the  rules  of procedure  and  conduct  of  business  in  lok  sabha    once  we  have  agitated  this matter in detail during the introduction of the finance bill 2015  i am forced to repeat the arguments once again   rule 2191 is distinct and separate and it is only to give effect to the finance proposals for the year or for the following year that is for a particular period and not of a permanent nature  article 1101 of the constitution of india also elaborately discusses  for the purposes of this chapter a bill shall be deemed to be a money bill if it contains only provisions dealing with all  or  any  of  the  following  matters  clauses  a  to  f  which  deals  with  taxation proposals recovery of money regulation of the borrowing of money custody with the  consolidated  fund  and  the  contingency  fund  of  india  and  appropriation  of money under the consolidated fund of india and so on  how an issuance of the electoral  rolls  fall  within  the  taxation  proposals  over  matters  incidental  to  the taxation proposal  that is the question which i would like to know  just now we have  received  the  list  of  amendments    40  existing  acts  are  proposed  to  be amended by means of this finance bill when the original bill was presented on 1st february  2017  only  8  to  10  acts  were  proposed  to  be  amended    these amendments are pushed through this house by suspending rule 80i of the rules of  procedure  and  conduct  of  business  in  lok  sabha    i  would  like  to  know whether it is right because rule 80i is very specific and says that an amendment should  be  related  to  the  matter  which  is  connected  with  the  facts  of  the  original bill  unfortunately these things are not connected with the original bill and these amendments are now being pushed through or they are being bulldozed just a few minutes before  there is the ruling which was given in the year 1956 and in 1970 also the same ruling was given  madam you also gave ruling on 3042015  this was the ruling which you had given when the finance bill of 2015 was brought in this house when a point of order had been raised by myself and prof saugata roy  my point is that it is absolutely a backdoor legislation  it cannot be allowed under the pretext of a finance bill  i strongly oppose the move to suspend the rules of procedure  so  as  to  bring  very  cardinal  structural  amendments  to  the  existing  30 acts  it is the legitimate democratic and supreme right of the parliament which is being taken away  so i strongly oppose moving of this bill for consideration and passing  i am seeking a ruling from you once again on this aspect
