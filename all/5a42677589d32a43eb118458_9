 the reason as to why i appreciate the bill  is  that  the  amendment  has  been  proposed  to  increase  the  authorized  capital from rs5000 crore to rs30000 crore  if we see the crises and the demand from the farmers community the proposed amount is not adequate the present scenario is  that  credit  from  nationalized  banks  and  from  financial  institutions  is  not available    that  is  why  there  is  a  crisis  in  the  agrarian  economy    so  nabard should  come  forward  with  new  credit  and  interest  policy  so  that  more  farmers could  avail of  the  loan   even  though  nabard  has  a  mechanism  for  disbursing loan yet  a  major  portion of  the  loan is  flowing  to  urban  areas   there  are  hardly any rural bank branches in northeastern states even though there are regulations in  this  regard    even  in  my  own  state  of  tripura  i  have  seen  that  though  some loans are disbursed for building bridges and creating infrastructure but loan is not forthcoming  for  the  small  and  marginal  farmers  of  the  state  through  cooperative societies the intention or the aim with which nabard has been created has not been  fulfilled  as  it  is  not  reaching  out  to  the  farflung  areas    that  is  why  the coverage of nabard and its access to the real masses or the poor people should be further expanded
