  our  country consists  of  various  communities  and  castes  and  there  was  a  great  need  to  bring about equity harmony and equality among them for which efforts were also made  however this effort needs to be expedited even now  our thinking has started to be confined to ourselves our family and our community instead of  going for the uplift  of  all    we  need  to  widen  our  thinking    there  might  be  truth  in  what  the opposition leader said that addition and deletion of castes is thought over at present on the basis of politics and pressure  there is a need to make such an atmosphere that such a thing is not being done under any political or any other type of pressure keeping  in  view  some  profit  or  loss  and  such  proposals  should  be  made  on  the basis of meting out justice to all the castes and communities and the poor  effort has been made to make the law stringent in order to provide justice and economic assistance  to  the  family  of  the  victim  in  case  injustice  atrocity  and  criminal incidents  take  place  against  the  people  belonging  to  the  sc  category    the government  has  formulated  various  types  of  schemes  for  their  social  economic educational  and  political  empowerment    and  we  are  implemented  these  schemes  this  government  of  the  bjp  the  nda  is  in  favour  and  will  remain  in  favour  of reservation  which  has  been  provided  in  the  constitution  till  the  inequalities continue  on  the  basis  of  which  these  have  been  provided  for    we  endeavour  to ensure  quality  education  to  the  people  of  these  communities  also    we  provide scholarship for it  we give the facility of coaching as well  if someone wishes to go abroad for studies we provide such facilities to himher also  our government has taken a decision that if any ngo or social organization registered institutions organize  the  birth  or  death  anniversary  of  baba  saheb  ambedkar  jyotiba  phule ravidas  kabirdas  etc  an  assistance  of  upto  5  lakh  will  be  provided    dr ambedkar saheb had made efforts to kindle the sense of patriotism and we too are trying  to  create  the  same  ambience  for  the  emergence  of  a  sense  of  patriotism  hon  prime  minister  asked  me  to  declare  the  places  of  respect  related  to ambedkarji a place of pilgrimage  acting upon the suggestions of the hon prime minister  we  converted  the  name  of  his  birth  place  mau  in  indore  district  into ambedkar  nagar      at  the  same  time  his  birth  place  was  declared  as  a  place  of pilgrimage    he  was  initiated  in  nagpur  and  at  that  place  of  his  initiation  a committee had constructed a monument  now the government of maharashtra is working out an action plan to expand the land of initiation with about an outlay of rs275    crore    26  alipur  road  a  place  where  ambedkarji  breathed  his  last  was also  declared  to  be  a  national  memorial  and  a  magnificent  monument  has  been decided to be built there  one more magnificent monument has been decided to be built with the expenditure of about rs350 crore at  chaitya bhumi where the last rituals  of  ambedkar  saheb  was  performed    it  has  been  decided  to  set  up  the ambedkar international study center with the cost of rs192 crore at 15 janapath so that people may be able to understand his ideology  most of the people were of the  opinion  that  ambedkarji  was  not  a  patriot  but  i  would  like  to  assert  he  was patriot because he studied in britain and america and in addition to it he had more than 24  degrees  of higher  education   he could have  opted  to get  a  job there  and live a luxurious life with his family but he came back to india with a resolution to sort  out  the  problems  of  inequality  among  people  and  made  efforts  in  this direction  he was of the opinion that the solution to this problem does not lie in the creation of separate things  simultaneously he believes that the temple of god and the natural ponds are meant for everybody and everybody is entitled to avail of the  benefits  of  all  these  things      in  fact  he  has  taken  the  sense  of  vasudev kutumbkam in the right spirit and tried to create an ambience on that ground  as per  as  the  problem  of  dhankar  caste  is  concerned  no  proposal  to  this  effect  has been received from the state government  similarly i would like to  say to those who  have  raised  the  issue  of  inclusion  of  a  caste  into  the  list  that  no  proposals have  been  received  from  their  respective  states  in  this  respect    everybody  wants that the percentage of reservation be raised but we cannot provide reservation more than 50 per cent as there is a ruling of the supreme court in this regard  about the subplan and the rules and regulations related thereto i can say this much that no government  has  ever  released  more  than  15  per  cent  fund    the  budgetary provision for subplan has never exceeded from 9 to 95 per cent during the upa regime    now  this  is  a  matter  of  happiness  that  more  than  rs52  thousand  crore has been given under this plan which shows an increase of 30 per cent as compared to the previous time  our prime minister has started to provide 42 per cent of fund to  the  states  which  was  earlier  32  per  cent  in  order  to  strengthen  the  federal structure  and  to  shore  up  the  economic  condition  of  the  states    moreover  5  per cent more fund has been given to the urban bodies and 2 per cent for pachayati raj system  and  also  2  per  cent  more  as  an  expenditure  to  be  incurred  on  the implementation of these schemes  we provide overseas scholarship to the students going  abroad  for  studies    in  addition  we  provide  fund  under  the  fellowship scheme to the students aspiring to get any special degree or phd  we have started direct  benefit  transfer  scheme  which  plugged  the  leakage    after  all  we  have formulated  a  number  of  schemes  in  order  to  usher  in  overall  development    i  am happy that we have been successful in protecting the interests of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes  we will try to create an atmosphere of equality harmony and  dialogue      the  cooperation  of  all  of  you  is  also  solicited  in  realizing  these objectives    we  are  allocating  fund  for  sc  subplan  according  to  the  rules  and regulations  made  therefore  by  the  previous  government    we  have  given  three times more funds  an hon member has quoted karnataka as an example in this respect i would like to say that there are a number of states like madhya pradesh chhattisgarh himachal pradesh etc  which provide more budgetary allocation for the  welfare  of  these  classes  as  compared  to  that  of  karnataka    the  erstwhile government  declared  aligarh  muslim  university  and  jamiya  miliya  islamiya university  as  minority  educational  institutions  despite  their  being  in  the  list  of central  universities    as  a  result  the  students  from  scheduled  castes  and scheduled tribes community were deprived of the benefit of reservation  i would like to know from the congress party if it will support the initiatives to be taken to restore  the  facility  of  reservation  to  the  students  of  scheduled  castes  and scheduled tribes in both of these universities  the bill was passed
