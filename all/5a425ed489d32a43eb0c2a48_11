  the  gst  bill  will undoubtedly have lots of benefits like concrete tax structure broadening of tax base simplifying tax procedures avoiding duplication and cascading effects and creating a single common market  i just want to ask the government if there are any future plans to bring the alcohol and petroleum products within the gambit of  gst    at  present  the  central  government  has  agreed  to  compensate  the states for five years  i think that the government would also continue it even after five years if the loss continues  one challenge that is still there before the government is of categorization of commodities as well as of companies  the government  should  have  brought  this  bill  after  resorting  to  these  important issues    it  is  good  to  charge  alcoholic  beverages    the  government  should reconsider  putting  additional  cess  on  aerated  drinks  particularly  nonalcoholic beverages  because  the  common  man  are  also  taking  them  in  big  quantities  when it comes to the offshore jurisdiction earlier it was vested with the central government    now  they  are  giving  the  power  upto  12  nautical  miles  to  the states  if the sea is shared by two states every time there will be a big problem for  the  fishermen  of  both  the  states  which  needs  to  be  resolved    the government  is  putting  additional  cess  whenever  there  is  a  loss  of  revenue  by the  states  on  consumer  durables  which  also  include  a  small  refrigerator  airconditioner and all that  so i think this issue should be relooked at presently the tax base is shared by the government of india and state governments in the ratio of 5050 but now with the advent of gst the entire base is likely to go to the  government  of  india  in  the  long  run  the  concept  of  federalism  may disappear as far as financial matters are concerned  so at least the companies which have the gst turnover of less than rs15  crore should be given to the state government  besides stiff rules are required for tax defaulters
