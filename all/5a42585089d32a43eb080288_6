 this is a good budget  my request to the hon minister  is  that  the  education  cess  collected  through  various  states  should  be given  back  to  the  concerned  states  for  the  development  of  education  and educational infrastructure in those states  the government should reduce the rate of income tax for the elderly people of above 60 years in the country to a flat 10 per  cent   there  is  a need  to promote  affordable  housing  and  real  estate  sector in tier  ii  and  tier  iii  cities  in  the  country  particularly  in  tamil  nadu    in  order  to provide cashless economy and transparency it is proposed to amend section 80g so as to provide that no deduction shall be allowed under section 80g in respect of donation  of  any  sum  exceeding  rs  2000  unless  such  sum  is  paid  by  any  mode other than cash  this will be a landmark decision  the gsts effect on the entire indian  economy  will  have to be scrutinized in totality  to reach  a  widely  accepted conclusion  until then manufacturing states like tamil nadu should be adequately compensated  and  their  losses  for  accepting  and  implementing  gst  should  be repaid then and there till the moment of break even is reached the large drop in tamil  nadus  share  in  the  divisible  pool  is  barely  compensated    in  the  last  two union budgets many new cesses and surcharges have been levied which reduces the  shareable  pool  of  central  tax  receipts  and  thereby  the  devolution  to  states  many schemes have been delinked from central assistance
