 this bill gives me the conviction that it will perhaps put an end to brain drain which has been a problem in our country for a  while    in  this  bill  particular  stress  has  been  laid  on  three  words  namely education  training  and  research  in  the  field  of  biotechnology    the  setting  up  of this  center  would  give  a  fillip  to  these  activities    i  would  like  to  add  one  more thing that this country badly needs the process of owning patents  it has been our misfortune  that  we  have  been  lacking  in  having  a  process  or  institution  which could establish that a particular research is owned by us  if we are not having any biodiversity and if we ignore the deep value offered by it then we will not be able to move  much ahead in terms of biotechnology  we need to identify those areas and the extent to which the knowledge of biotechnology will be used in them  the creation of only biological names of the medicinal plants will not suffice  we need to be aware of and codify local names of those plants also for the simple purpose of strengthening our case in case of any patent fight  had we been able to record the local names of those plants we would have scarcely lost our battle for patents  we  do  not  lack  intellectual  property  and  capability    it  is  already  with  us  however  we  need  to  have  resources  for  patenting  that  knowledge  and  this precisely is the purpose of this bill also
