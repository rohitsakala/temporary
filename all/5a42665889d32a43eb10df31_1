  i am really happy that i am  speaking  on  a  bill  which  is  really  for  the  benefit  of  a  vast  majority  of  poor workers  of  our  country    bonus  in  the  employees  life  is  very  important  because those who get bonus are poor people  i would like to know whether it should be increased  to  rs  25000  or  it  should  be  according  to  the  inflation    it  has  been mentioned  seven  thousand  rupees  or  the  minimum  wages    it  is  also  said  that where the employees pay is more than rs 3500 they are also be in the rs 3500 bracket    my  question  is  this  if  somebody  is  getting  a  payment  of  rs  2000  or 2400 what will be the amount they will get  according to another amendment the  government  may  come  out  with  some  rules  or  regulations  regarding  these things   but  it  is not clearly  mentioned in the  bill  as  to  what  sort  of  government regulations will be there
