 all the hon members have supported the bill with certain observations  we are also trying to see that all the obsolete laws should be repealed as early as possible  for repealing an act the administrative  ministry  has  to  be  consulted   similarly on  certain subjects  which are in the concurrent list we have to write to the state governments to get their opinion    i  can  assure  the  hon  members  that  certainly  all  the  1863  acts  which have been identified as obsolete and redundant we would take care of such laws as soon  as  we  get  the  concurrence  from  the  state  government  and  ministries concerned    we  are  already  working  on  automatic  repeal  clause    this  year onwards  there  will  be  a  sunset  clause  in  all  the  appropriation  bills    automatic repeal clause is the need of the hour  but we need to study further as to how it can be  done  because  it  should  not  have  any  impact  in  subsequent  days    dead  laws create confusion with the living laws this is the observation made by the supreme court  this is the fourth repealing and amending bill that i have placed before this  house  in  short  span  of  six  months    i  will  see  that  all  1863  obsolete  laws would be repealed the bill as amended was passed
