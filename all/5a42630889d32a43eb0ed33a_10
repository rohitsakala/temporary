  in  principle  i  oppose  this  concept  of having  public  private  partnership  in  higher  education  sector    i  fully  agree  with  the hon  minister  that  it  is  a  necessity  and  urgency    we  have  already  commenced  15 iiits    to  confer  the  statutory  status  to  these  educational  institutions  is  need  of  the hour    but  the  only  point  is  that  this  iiit  should  give  access  to  the  poor  children belonging to bpl and the common people of this country  in clause 3 subclause b the board in relation to any institute means the board of governors referred to in  subsection1  of  section  14    this  is  not  a  pure  and  clear  definition  in  clause  my  next  point  is  this    this  is  a  selffinancing  institute    i  agree  with  this  503515 ratio  but the capital expenditure will be borne by the government of india for five years    subsequent  to  the  said  five  years  who  will  finance  these  institutes  definitely it will be a selffinancing institute  what is the fate of the selffinancing institute    i  can  share  my  experience  in  my  state    we  have  started  selffinancing colleges  and  engineering  colleges  are  started  like  anything    now  the  hon  high court has come to a verdict that most of the colleges have a result of less than 10 per cent and the entire higher education scenario is in peril  resources have to be found within the organization  that means the fees will be very high and the poor children or the poor students will not be able to afford the fee structure
