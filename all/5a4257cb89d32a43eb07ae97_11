  the government talks of reducing the cost of litigation  however it is my belief that we may not achieve this since there is no transparency  in  this  bill  regarding  fees    i  am  of  the  view  that  appointments  of judges  for this  purpose  should  be the  same  as their  appointments  in other  courts  such  appointments  can  be  made  by  a  panel  of  commercial  experts    i  hope  that about one crore commercial cases pending in various courts would be disposed of quickly   my  suggestion is that the limit  of  one  crore  rupee should  be  reduced  to rupee 25 lakhs   there should be provision strict implementation of the law  i am of the view that if the government succeeds in bringing complete transparency in this bill then those who prefer singapore and london to settle their cases will be attracted to india for speedy disposal
