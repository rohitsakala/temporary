  the  bill  is  good  and  i  support  it except  for  a  few  clarifications  that  are  required    there  is  this  point  about compensation    it  has  not  been  left  to  the  judiciary  but  to  the  executive    death penalty  has  been  stressed  upon  in  this  amended  bill  but  i  do  not  know  whether death penalty alone will be a proper deterrent  the cisf is a force that is guarding all our  airports   the  airports  are very  hitech  establishments  and the  cisf is  not trained  or  not  equipped  to  handle  the  exigencies  that  might  arise  at  any  time    i believe  that  it  is  time  we  developed  a  special  force  exclusively  meant  for  airport security  everyone including vips should go through the same scrutiny  the third point i would like to mention is that there are these hoax calls and fake hijacking  we must not allow hijacking to happen and to stop that you have to make things better which you are not doing  you must have no vip treatment for anybody
