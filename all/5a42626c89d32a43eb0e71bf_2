 a bill at the stage of introduction can be opposed only  on  two  grounds    one  is  the  legislative  competency  of  parliament  and  the other  is  whether  a  bill  is  violative  of  fundamental  rights    now  both  those objections have not been raised and therefore the limited jurisdiction at the stage of introduction of bill that it can be opposed on two considerations does not arise at  this  stage    the  detailed  finance  memorandum  clearly  mentions  that  there  are certain  categories  of  expenditure  which  cannot  be  estimated  at  this  stage  secondly the bill has already been circulated two days in advance and therefore adequate time has been given  again it is an essential part of legislative drafting that some provisions can be amended by  the schedules  the schedules will also be considered by this parliament and therefore the rights of parliament are not in any way being taken away by this bill at all   the bill was introduced
