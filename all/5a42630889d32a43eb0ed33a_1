 i am glad to speak on this  bill  as  i  started  my  professional  career  as  software  engineer    i  would  like  to know  from  the  hon  minister  of  human  resource  development  about  the  two  iiit projects one of which was already set up in amethi and the other was to be set up in sonepat  what are the reasons for closing down iiit amethi and it being shifted to allahabad  alongwith  its  students    the  proposed  iiit  sonepat  lies  in  my parliamentary  constituency  whose  foundation  was  laid  by  pallam  raju  ji  and choudhary bhupinder singh hooda ji in 2003  even the work thereon was started  but  the  work  was  stopped  just  after  the  change  in  the  government    i  am  talking about  the  two  lok  sabha  parliamentary  constituency  where  the  members  of parliament  are  from  the opposition   i  would  like  to  request the  minister  of  human resource  development  to  tell  about  the  reasons  for  the  works  not  being  started  for these  two  iiits  and  their  campuses  were  not  set  up  whereas  the  work  on  the remaining iiits is going on  it sector is a very crucial sector  but over a period of time  the  capacity  of  this  sector  to  provide  employment  has  waned    the  economic slowdown as well as the increasing protectionist policy of the countries like usa are responsible for this situation  the restrictions imposed by the usa on its h1b visa policy are specially responsible for this  the prime minister himself should come forward to clarify if he has taken up the matter with the usa during his recent visit to relax  the  restrictions  placed  on  h1b  visa  policy    if  this  is  not  done  the  it professionals  of  india  will  have  to  face  many  difficulties  to  work  in  the  usa    i would also like to suggest that this bill does not provide for the establishment of the extension centres of iiits  hence such provisions should be incorporated in this bill enabling  the  establishment  of  extension  centres  of  the  flagship  iiits  like  iiit bengaluru  and  iiit  hyderabad  so  that  the  students  of  this  area  may  also  get admission  therein    the  most  significant  feature  of  the  it  sector  is  that  it  does  not require  big  infrastructure  for  its  establishment    india  dominates  56  per  cent  of  it trade  in  the  world  due  to  our  silicon  valley  as  compared  to  the  usa    the  prime minister should say that if the silicon valley of california is showing the path to the world then the bengaluru has gone a little ahead of it  at this point in time things appear  to  have  been  left  on  their  own  in  the  it  sector  due  to  which  the  situation  is going from bad to worse  so this needs to be changed
