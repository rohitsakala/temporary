  i  think  the  government  is  definitely  and befittingly  grating  autonomy to these institutions thereby  decreasing the government  interference  and  increasing  the  autonomy  of  the  institutions    our state  andhra  pradesh  has  unfortunately  got  bifurcated    of  course  it  was  very scientifically  done    as  far  as  central  universities  are  concerned  we  feel  very lucky  that  they  are  coming  in  andhra  pradesh    but  iim  visakhapatnam  is working  like  a  surrogate  institute  because  there  is  no  fund    therefore  you  are requested  to  allocated  more  funds    apart  from  this  abc  iim  ahmedabad  iim bangalore and iim calcutta which are wellknown to provide autonomy to other institutes is also a very good step  but out of the total number of faculties which are  233  or  something  only  two  or  three  are  from  the  scheduled  castes  and scheduled  tribes  category  under the  reservation  policy   this type  of representation  of  scs  and  sts  in  our  higher  institutes  like  iims  and  iits  is  most unfortunate   iims being the beacons  of knowledge are the  ones  who can create prosperity through  business trading  manufacturing  and  enough  financial activities    these  are  the  people  who  are  heading  the  international  institutes  also  for example indra nooyi is from an iim and she is heading pepsico  therefore these iims definitely need to be boosted and more quality faculty need to be also given  regarding accountability there is some problem  also please see to it that they do not enhance the fees on account of their capacity to award degrees
