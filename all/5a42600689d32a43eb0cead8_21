 i would want this house to carefully ponder over the  question  as  to  what  is  merit    i  pose  this  question  because  i  feel  that  in  our country there is a grave danger of passing of accumulated caste privilege as merit  if there are huge sections of our people who have suffered historic injustice then we should be very careful not to lable them as people who lack merit  iit act wad passed in 1961  but 225 per cent reservation were extended to the iits in 1973  that was done under the prime ministership of shrimati indira gandhi  the obc reservations were not extended until as late as 2006  in iit chennai 464 faculty members  were  in  the  general  category  59  in  the  obc  category  only  11  in  the scheduled caste category in 2015  these numbers cannot be explained by merit alone    we  have  now  given  some  accessibility  to  our  iits  and  to  our  central universities to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes  but the question is have we  given  them  the  feeling  of  equal  citizenship  inside  the  portals  of  our  great institutions  of  higher  learning    we  should  make  sure  that  we  have  the  human resources  to  staff  the  new  institutes    meghnad  saha  had  suggested  that  even nuclear physics research should take place in our finest universities  i would like to  urge  this  government  while  building  on  the  achievements  of  the  past  to  also show a new direction of policy for the future so that the iits which are very good teaching institutions also become the venues for cutting edge research
