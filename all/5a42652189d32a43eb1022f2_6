 todays bill is consequential to the goods and services tax compensation to the states bill  our party our nation and this parliament took a great leap of faith in our government  we hope that this will lead our country to a new era of taxcompliance  we also have faith in  the  gst  council    literally  the  government  gave  lot  of  powers  to  the  gst council    but  passing  the  bill  is  one  thing  implementation  is  yet  another  thing  nevertheless  we  wish  the  government  well  to  implement  the  bill  with  as  much zeal as it did with passing the bill
