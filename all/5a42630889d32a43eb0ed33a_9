  we  are  talking  about  these  institutions  at  a  time when  this  industry  is  going  through  a  major  crisis    everywhere  there  are retrenchments  in  the  it  industry    i  doubt  whether  these  indian  institutes  of information technology which are intended for it will have any future because the content  of information  technology  always  has a  short shelf life    therefore i  am  of the  strong opinion there should be an intensive training on  the  robotics  or  artificial intelligence    these  are  the  ones  which  definitely  have  an  edge  over  the  routine information  technology  therefore  robotics  artificial  intelligence  divergent  and unconventional things of it industry should also be a part of this curriculum  instead of  making it  industry  a  job  seeker let  us  make  it as entrepreneurs so that  they  can provide jobs to the youth  we should always remember it industry as a revolution  in kakinada an iiit was inaugurated five year back  it has just stopped there only  i would  request  the  hon  minister  to  look  into  the  matter  as  to  why  this  has  been stopped and request him to rejuvenate it  i would request him to give top priority to new things allotted to andhra pradesh and give some academic importance to andhra pradesh on the indian map
