    despite the  member  of  parliament of kanpur rural i am directly related to the city and its development and i have got an opportunity to see its miseries very closely  migration from villages to cities due to geographical social and economic reasons is breaking the backbone of cities  in such a scenario it was necessary that in one side large scale migration from villages must be stopped and on the other side infrastructure of city should be strengthened  it  is  painful  to  note  that  kanpur  has  not  been  included  in  the  list  of  smart  city despite  having  many  qualities    this  city  has  lost  its  place  due  to  negligence  of previous governments and almost all industries have migrated from here and lack of infrastructure  facilities  business  is  also  losing  its  grip    it  is  very  unfortunate  that previous  up  governments  also  did  not  do  any  justice  to  this  city    there  is  acute shortage  of  drinking  water  in  the  city  due  to  leakage  at  more  than  90  locations  funds  allocated  under  jnnurm  scheme  is  being  highly  misappropriated    every work executed under the said scheme must be probed  i would like to urge upon the govt to develop such a monitoring mechanism so that at least basic facilities must be made available to the people living in the city  i would like to request the honble minister to include kanpur city in the list of smart city
