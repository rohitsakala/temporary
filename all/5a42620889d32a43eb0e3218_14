  it  seems  that  this  bill  will  not  be  able  to prohibit child labour  number of child labour is more in poor states this makes it clear  that  if  we  want  to  reduce  the  child  labour  we  will  first  have  to  eradicate poverty  from  the  country    increasing  population  of  the  country  and  lack  of education are  aso major reasons for child labour  mostly the children of the poor families are compelled to work as child labour  though all the parties want to put an end to this problem the problem of child will always remain there till poverty is there  in  the  country    we  cannot  find  a  lasting  solution  to  this  problem  merely bringing in amendments in laws  finally i would like to request the government that it should consider the suggestions given by the members of opposition parties and try to act upon them
