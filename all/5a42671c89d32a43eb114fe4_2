  sale  of  precious  spurious  and substandard articles is an alarming issue  it concerns the safety and the health of the consumers at large  so we should ensure standardization to be mandatory for each and every item sold  nonstandard electrical and electronic items stresses the need for a comprehensive legislation  in europe there is 100 per cent compliance for  standards    i  hope  that  india  will  gradually  move  towards  that  direction  without  having  a  certificate  or  license  from  the  bureau  of  indian  standards  no person can make a public claim through advertisements of his goods conforming to an  indian  standard    any  person  who  contravenes  this  provision  shall  be punishable  with  imprisonment    section  18  makes  obligatory  provision  for  the license holder to display the making and labelling requirements of the product  to ensure  quality  and  safety  to  the  consumers  our  policies  are  wellformulated  in painstaking  detail  and  wellintentioned    therefore the  bis  should  do  away  with the  voluntary  scheme  and  make  it  mandatory  for  all  the  products  to  conform  to basic  quality  standards  international  trade  rules  stipulate  that  standards  for imported goods need  to be  the  same  as  those  for local  manufacturers   there  is  a need  to  have  standardisation  of  service  sector    the  current  legislation  also  has provisions  to  provide  recall  including  liability  of  products  bearing  the  standard mark  but  not  conforming  to  relevant  indian  standards    filing  and  pursuing  a single complaint case under bis act costs about rupees one lakh and about two to three  years  litigation    undoubtedly  the  bis  act  lacks  teeth    enforcement machinery of bis is not very satisfactory  hence bis should be given complete prosecution  powers  to  act  on  every  item    i  hope  the  bill  when  enacted  will definitely  promote  harmonious  development  of  the  activities  of  standardization making and quality certification of goods and services
