  i  believe  that  proposed bill will definitely bring out good legal reforms in india  we also strongly believe that  justice  delayed  is  justice  is  denied    therefore  just  as  the  hon  minister  has suggested  the  timeframe  in  the  arbitration  and  reconciliation  act  perhaps  the timeframe should also be put in respect of some of the cases particularly the cases of  commercial  nature    we  all  know  that  there  is  a  huge  backlog  and  a  large number of vacancies in courts  unless that is taken care of any number of creating additional  machineries  may  not  solve  the  problem  of  the  accumulation  of  cases  while  the  power  has  been  given  for  the  chief  justice  of  the  respective  courts  to nominate the judges as far as the special courts are concerned i would request the hon  minister  that  a  special  mechanism  could  be  evolved  where  trained  efficient and  honest  judges  could  be  considered    now  we  are  evolving  the  multiple systems    so  we  should  ensure  that  the  multiple  bodies  should  not  affect  the existing legal system  again threefourths of the undertrials are coming from the minorities dalits  and  tribals   the  hon minister  may  kindly  look  into  this  aspect and  try  to help the  weaker  sections of society   it is  the need of  the hour that  the government takes up steps to establish the indian judicial services as well so that they  are  accountable  and  answerable  like  all  other  civil  servants    i  would  also request  the  hon  minister  to  kindly  consider  the  various  aspect  of  the  summary judgment without recording the oral evidences and see how it could be effectively implemented
