  first  of  all  on  behalf  of  the people  of  telangana  i  would  like  to  congratulate  shri  yogi  aditya  nath  for becoming  the  chief  minister  of  uttar  pradesh  the  union  government  has  not given much to our state telangana  of course advancing the budget by one month is a significant change enabling states to start their work right from the first week of  april    i  would  like  to  appreciate  the  budget  where  generous  increase  can  be seen  particularly  the  higher  education  sector  has  seen  an  increase  of    122  per cent  it has been increased from rs 29703 crore to rs33300 crore  i would like to  mention  the  national  nutrition  mission  for  which  budgetary  provision  of  rs 175  crore  has  been  increased  to  rs1500  crore    the  maternity  benefits programme  which only  used  to  get  rs634  core now  gets  rs2700  crore   under pradhan  mantri  grameen  awas  yojana  the  central  government  decided  that  it will  build  36  million  houses  in  this  year  whereas  the  state  governments  have stated  that  they  are  going  to  build  only  241  million  houses  this  year    the government  will  have  to  think  once  again  as  to  how  it  is  going  to  meet  this difference of the target  moreover there has been  just rs300 crore increase in the allocation of the midday meal scheme  i hope it will be revised soon  i would like  to  demand  from  the  government  that  the  pension  amount  of  rs200  for  the widows  should  be  increased  to  rs500  because  there  are  a  number  of  states  like telangana who have to pay rs1000 as pension to widows and the old age persons and  rs1500  to  the  differently  abled  persons    according  to  the  information available on the website of the reserve bank of india the overall credit for priority sector lending has fallen by 106 per cent as compared to the last year   if priority sector  lending  is  not  increased  we  will  not  be  able  to  create  employment    the minimum  target  should  be  to  give  away  rs  12  lakh  crore  to  farmers  as  loans instead  of  rs10  lakh  crore    the  finance  minister  wants  to  take  india  from informal  economy  to  a  formal  economy  where  he  would  like  to  encourage  more and  more  digital  transactions    but  unless  and  until  safety  is  there  and  the transaction becomes more viable and cheaper i do not believe people will go for digital transaction  so i request the hon finance minister to look into this issue  i would like to make a point about my state  the installment of rs400 crore which has been pending should be released  the pending amount of rs450 crore for our backward  districts  should  also  be  released    moreover  the  status  of  national project should be accorded to the koleshwaram project of our state
