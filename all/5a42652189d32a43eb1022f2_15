 todays moment is a historical moment  today  commitment  and  determination  of  enforcing  goods  and  service tax  gst  is  proving  to  be  a  milestone  for  securing  financial  freedom  for  every citizen  of  the  country  whereas  this  move  reflects  the  original  spirit  of  our constitution on the other hand it will create new history by making the tax regime both at central and state level transparent and effective through collection of high revenue  this  amendment  is  the  most  important  revolutionary  reformist  and historical step of this decade i recall bharat ratna atal bihari vajpayee who had envisaged gst in the year 2003 he therefore constituted kelkar committee for this kelkar ji stated in that committee that integrated tax system is of paramount importance as a result thereof indias tax structure being one of the poorest tax structures  in  the  world  was  turned  into  an  excellent  tax  structure  in  the  world  i think that  this bill  has  been  the  most  discussed  bill  after  independence  history  of the nation there will be good coordination among states due to input tax credit in gst  collection  obviously  inflation  increases  when  tax  is  imposed  one  after  the other  but  now  it  will  come  down  i  think  that  whereas  single  market  system  will become certainty on the other hand accountability and monitoring will increase and black money will be checked most important thing is that information technology will  be  used  which  will  not  only  stop  theft  but  also  increase  the  tax  collection  inspector  regime  will  totally  disappear  by  registering  all  products  manufactured from  raw  materials  in  computers  it  will  simplify  the  indirect  taxes  excise  and service  tax  would  be  cheaper  implementing  gst  certainly  boosts  the  samradh bharat and shreshtha bharat make in india skill india digital india missions of our  prime  minister  shri  narendra modi  ji the  gdp is likely  to  increase  by  two percent  as  a  result  thereof  complication  of  tax  would  be  diminished  from integrated system i also like to state that we will go ahead in the world we can trust  that  our  growth  rate  would  cross  two  digit  in  forthcoming  years  foreign investment  would  definitely  increase  because  today  around  one  hundred  fifty countries have gst investors go to other countries like china thailand vietnam due  to  our  complicated  tax  system  at  the  end  i  would  like  to  say  that  for clarifying  doubts  if  any  council  has  been  constituted  and  states  have  got  66 percent  representations  therein    finance  minister  has  already  said  about compensation  and  provision  of  around  rs  34  thousand  crores  has  been  made  i would  like  to  request  only  one  thing  that  there  should  be  proper  monitoring  on border areas
