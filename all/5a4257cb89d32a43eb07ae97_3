  at the  outset  i  oppose this commercial courts commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts bill 2015 which seems to have been drafted in a halfhearted manner  a  this  juncture  i  would  suggest  that  the  bill  be  referred  to  the  standing committee more so since it has not gone through the scrutiny  i begin to point out a  few  mistakes  that  i  have  noticed  in  this  bill    i  refer  to  chapter  13  clause  12 which  very  clearly  states  that  cases  only  above  rs  1  crore  would  be  handled  by commercial courts  how would this change in law affect the work of judges or the courts  is  something  that  is  to  be  considered    it  seems  that  the  government  is actually creating this provision only to help big business  this specific sum of rs 1 crore seems a little dicey to me  the government is not interested in solving the problems of those companies which have disputes of value lesser than rs 1 crore  section  4  states  that  the  judges  for  these  courts  will  be  appointed  by  the  chief justice of respective state high courts  why not involve the state governments also    what  will  be  the  criteria  for  allotment  of  judges  to  a  particular  case    we need more transparency in this matter in order to ensure that justice is served not only served but it should also seem to be served which is of very vital importance in  india  today    suppose  it  falls  through  in  lok  sabha  or  let  us  assume  it  falls through  in  rajya  sabha    then  your  ordinance  would  also  lapse    some  people who  have  jumped  into  the  net  which  you  created  to  protect  them  from  23rd october 2015 till the beginning of this session which was 26th of november what happens  to  them    will  they  get  your  benefit  or  will  they  be  deprived  of  the benefit  who are the companies
