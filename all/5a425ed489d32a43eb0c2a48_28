  we are having discussion on gst from  2005  onwards    we  know  that  it  is  a  paradigm  shift  in  the  interest  tax regime  this is a structural change in the indirect tax system  it is a significant improvement  in  the  indirect  tax  reforms  also    we  hope  that  it  will  definitely benefit  the  national  economy    it  will  also  be  benefitting  in  the  case  of  tax compliance  we are all hopeful that the countrys indirect tax collection will be benefitted    my  apprehension  is  regarding  the  federal  structure  of  the  indian constitution   the  states  have  the  freedom  to  pursue  their  own  fiscal  policies  if the state government wants to raise the rate of tax the state government has to approach the gst  council for getting the rate of tax increased  that means the  fiscal  autonomy  of  the  states  have  been  abrogated  by    means  of  gst legislation    federal  character  is  the  basic  structure  of  the  indian  constitution   clause  9  of  the  central  gst  bill  stipulates  that  the  central  government  shall levy and impose tax at a rate not exceeding 20 per cent and this will be notified by  the  government  on  the  advice  of  the  gst  council    the  legislative supremacy  of  parliament  is  being  taken  away  by  the  gst  council  and  the government will notify the rate of tax    that is against the basic principle of our  constitution    gst  council  is  getting  arbitrary  discretionary  authority  to impose  cess  on  any  item   i  hope that it will benefit the nation  as a  whole but unfortunately the central government is benefitted more than the states
