  it seems that the gst bill is in the interest of  poor  states  however  the  government  has  made  no  provision  of  special exemption  in  the  interest  of  backward  states  like  bihar    hence  the government  should  consider  on  this  subject    the  government  should  make provision of giving incentive in the gst so that industries could be set up there also   i  demand  this  from  the  government    gst  is  a  positive  taxation  system which  will  lead  the  country  towards  development    after  implementation  of gst the revenue of government would increase and it will reduce tax evasion also  according to the economists it is estimated that there will be 1 to 2 rise in  gdp  in  the  next  34  years  my  suggestion  is  that  there  should  be  an autonomous  monitoring  mechanism  in  the  gst  council    the  government should  adopt  lenient  attitude  and  first  all  the  proposals  of  the  gst  council should  be  discussed  in  the  house  and  then  it  should  be  implemented    hence the  gst  council  should  be  completely  made  an  autonomous  body    provision should also be made for conducting audit through cag  i would like to request the  government  that  tax  should  not  be  levied  on  all  kinds  of  food  items necessary  and life  saving  drugs  and on  movement  of small  vehicles   it  would provide a great relief to the common people who are facing inflation
