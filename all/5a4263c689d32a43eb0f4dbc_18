  providing  constitutional  status  to  the national commission for backward classes is the need of the hour  every state is having a commission for the backward classes  now who is a backward class is being determined by the state   so i would like to urge upon the government that the consent of the state should be taken in order to determine a particular society or  a  particular  class  as  backward  class    there  are  also  economically  backward people among the forward castes  but only because of the reason that they belong to the forward castes they are being denied of all the privileges  the people who are economically backward but belong to forward classes of the society should also be  provided  with  some  privileges  so  as  to  have  the  better  living  standard  in  our country  the socioeconomic and caste census should be published
