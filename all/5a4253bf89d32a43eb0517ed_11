  this  bill  is  against  the  interests  of  the country  as  it  will  badly  affect  the  bordering  states  of  assam  meghalaya  west bengal  and  tripura    there    are  other  ways  of  building  relationship  with neighbours    giving  away  land  of  states  like  assam  where  we  lose  lakhs  of hectares  every  year  to  erosion  and  flood  is  not  the  only  way  of  having  good friendly  relationship  with  neighbours  and  this  will  not  solve  the  boundary problem  we feel the boundary problem should be permanently solved by erecting a  concrete  wall  between  india  and  bangladesh    our  hon  prime  minister  had promised that not even an inch of land will be given to bangladesh  i request him to keep his promise
