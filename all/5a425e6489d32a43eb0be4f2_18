 the development of a country requires two  resources  namely  material  and  human  resources    the  utilization  and development of both of these resources are imperative for the development of any country  the material resources such as mines oil and gas coal and other mineral are  being  looted  by  the  corporate  houses    at  the  same  time  providing  them concession  means  a  plunder  of  tax  payers  money      thus  the  policy  of  the government to provide concession to the corporate sector is not going in favour the country  the human resources are in a very pitiable condition   today the youths are  being  exploited  mentally  and  physically  entire  recruitment  in  the  service sector is either through contractual system or through outsourcing  this is a very dangerous  proposition  for  our  youth    this  will  also  not  help  to  bring  back  our economy on the tracks  the standards of education have gone down education has been commercialized and privatized  healthcare is also not in good shape as it has also  been  privatized    allocation  of  funds  under  mplad  scheme  should  be discontinued  because  this  is  a  paltry  amount  for  a  constituency  comprising  1500 villages and 10 small  big towns  therefore it should be either discontinued or it should be increased to rs 20 crore
