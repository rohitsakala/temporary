 rich walk to digest food and poor walk to earn their  livelihood    this  is  the  level  of  disparity  prevailing  in  our  country    undp says  that  the  number  of  poor  is  increasing  along  with  increase  in  the  number  of millionaires    about  80  percent  population  of  the  country  is  sustaining  on  the income of one dollar per day  but i am in support of this bill  i would like to say that it should be a balanced one  if the workers are given due share of their labour and quality then there would be no need at all to give them any bonus
