  hon  minister  has categorically clarified two points that it will have public sector undertakings which have not less than 51 per cent investment  a company may have 51 per cent alone or jointly  the government has also made a rule that it will have the right to give or cancel the licence which is a welcome step  we all know that when a company is  formed  it  gets  directors  and  they  have  certain  rights    there  should  be  a provision in the rules that if some international agreement is signed then it should be immediately brought into the notice of the house or the government  we have not given permission to any private company  i had said that atomic energy is not meant  for  producing  electricity  alone  it  has  wider  implications  for  our  security institutes medical system agriculture and even in the preservation and protection of seeds  i would like to say with all humility that if any company of tamil nadu which has got 51 per cent shares can become the partner if it wishes so  however the  circumstances  took  such  a  turn  that  in  the  year  2003  a  good  project  like bhawani states that since they did not have raw material they incurred losses and could not produce power  our two plants are lying half constructed at the border of tamil nadu and andhra pradesh even today  despite that the government did not  wake  up  from  their  slumber  for  10  to  12  years    i  had  stated  that  there  is  no scarcity  of  raw  material    i  can  claim  that  india  has  got  so  much  of  quantity  of thorium that it can feed half of the world  still if it is stated in the report of 200304  that  there  was  a shortage of raw  material  for  production  of power  in  bhawani then  it  could  be  an  outcome  of  wrong  policies    i  would  like  to  congratulate  the government for keeping the right to accord and cancel the licence
