  i  think  this  bill  will  have  farreaching  implication  in  the field  of  higher  education  particularly  the  engineering  education  in  our  country    i strongly object to the reduction in the number of reserved seats in these institutions  a recent report which appeared in the newspaper said that in 2017 itself nine per cent drop out has happened in iiits  they are mainly from the reserved categories  the vacancies  reserved  for  teaching  faculty  in  the  iiits  are  still  not  filled  up    the government  is  going  to  move  their  control  completely  and  hand  over  these institutions to the private market  that will not help our future generation  i request the  government  to  rethink  and  reframe  the  entire  bill  and  give  adequate representation in teaching faculty and student seats in these institutions so that we can create  more  engineering  students  and  more  responsible  persons  in  the  engineering filed in the future  we produce more than eight lakh engineering students every year but  the  unemployment  in  the  engineering  sector  is  60  per  cent    i  request  the government to give utmost importance to creating jobs
