 i would like to congratulate the minister  for  bringing  this  bill    one  of  the  objectives  of  this  bill  is  to  provide manpower  of  global  standards    though  our  it  professionals  are  highly  paid  still they  are  relatively  paid less  compared  to  their  western  counterparts   if  there  is  any stress  in  the  industry  and  layoffs  then  the  first  victims  are  the  indian  it professionals    it  is  because  mechanical  engineers  work  in  the  field  of  mechanical engineering  electrical  engineers  work  in  the  field  of  electrical  engineering  civil engineers  work  in  the  field  of  construction  but  it  engineers  and  it  professionals work  in  different  fields    therefore  there  is  a  need  for  not  just  exposure  to programming but a need for social science liberal arts performing arts and all these other  arts    many  members  have  said  that  we  should  introduce  robotics  artificial intelligence and other new technologies but more important than that is to introduce social sciences in the iiits
