  the  recent  price  rise  in  the essential  commodities  has  hurt  the  common  man  the  prices  of  pulses  which  is nearly a staple diet for most of the country has risen to a large extent from the last 2 years there is no supportive government policy which could have helped india to  raise  the  pulses  production  by  giving  more  incentives  to  the  farmers  growing pulses the prices of onion has risen nearly 300 or more in the last month the common  plea  given  by  the  government  to  the  people  of  india  during  every  rate increase is rising international crude prices but they should first answer why there is double taxation by center and state on sale of petrol and diesel my first question to the respective governments is why cannot these duties be reduced so that atleast the transportation cost for the common commodities is reduced now let us come to  the  contentious  issue  which  is  common  to  all  the  commodities  price  rise  and bone of contention between the government and opposition parties that is forward trading  my  only  point  is  why  do  you  need  speculative  trading  on  the  essential commodities the ever increasing cost of living has once again proven the age old theory  of  survival  of  the  fittest  when  the  prices  get  hiked  substantial  control measures have to be employed to check it paradoxically government has seldom made efforts to curb it as it considers hike a part of the game black markets also contribute  massively  to  hike  sugar  prices  prove  to  be  a  fitting  example  the profits  of  33  sugar  companies  have  rocketed  by  2900  to  rs  900  crores alongwith  a gigantic increase  in  the sugar  prices the  reason  being  crop  shortage which  was  in  turn  created  due  to  uncontrolled  exports  last  year  we  could  have built buffer stocks when we had the bumper crop but we didnt this facilitated a rise in profits of all the export and import companies while consumers were forced to pay much more than what they need to pay for sugar politicians have been procommercial rather than propeople for they have eased this hike with their malign usage of political influence in economic interests the need to the hour is to set up specifically dedicated departments to study the trends in economy which analyse the  exports imports and  domestic  agriculture  condition and propose new policies to check the price hike in our country
