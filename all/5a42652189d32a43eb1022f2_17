  there  are  two  problems  with the one per cent additional tax since the states are anyway to be compensated for their losses there is really no rational explanation for why the one per cent tax had to be introduced secondly the tax may not end at the end of two years since the bill  says  that  the  period  can  be  extended  by  the  gst  council  since  the  real benefits of the gst will flow only once tax rates get lowered the presence of the one per cent tax will only add to the overall costs according to section 18 of the bill  one  per  cent  tax  is  to  apply  to  all  supply  of  goods  and  not  sales  in  other words  if  there  are  branchstock  transfers  within  a  company  across  state boundaries the tax will be applicable to this given the large number of interstate transfers within firms this could raise the tax level to as high as five per cent an equally  big  problem  is  relating  to  real  estate  since  this  has  been  kept  out  of  the gst this means that there will be input tax credit on items like cement and steel that are used in the construction sector given how construction capital expenditure is around 3540 of all capital investment in the country this is a very big area that is being kept out until all the economy is covered by the gst and this will take years the 2 per cent benefit being talked about is not going to materialize and the 1 per cent type taxes will only add to the delay i do not know why this government is hell bent upon not sending the legislative document to the standing committee for the scrutiny i would like to share the concern of the state governments the telangana  finance  minster  has  told  the  central  government  that  it  must  pay compensation  to  states  for  the  abolition  of  central  sales  tax  before  going  ahead with the goods and services tax odisha government has demanded the centre to release central sales tax loss amount of rs 3255 crore before implementation of the  proposed  goods  and  services  tax  in  the  country  haryana  and  punjab  are opposed to the proposal to subsume purchase tax in gst arguing that it will lead to  revenue  losses  maharashtra  and  gujarat  are  for  levying  an  additional  tax  on production beyond two years and have also demanded that this tax be increased to two per cent mizoram tamil nadu and west bengal have demanded that they be allowed to levy higher taxes on tobacco and tobacco products similar to the central government  tamil  nadu  said  that  the  centre  should  evolve  a  consensus  on various  aspects  of  gst  like  taxes  before  pushing  the  constitution  amendment bill  the  bjp  government  both    at  the  centre  and  in  states  had  vehemently opposed the gst announced by the upa government and is now for its passage in this house
