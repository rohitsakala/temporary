    article  356  from  the  time  of  its inception  has  been  an  unpopular  provision  a  state  assembly  is  elected  for  the powers that the state assembly has the parliament is elected for the jurisdiction that  the  centre  has   this  is  the  essence  of  federalism    as  far  as  uttarakhand  is concerned  i  will  only  point  out  three  materials  on  the  27th  midnight  when  the council of ministers met and decided to advise the president 27 mlas asked for a division  and the  speaker  refused  to give a  division  secondly  you  have  a  video clipping which is true as per the forensic examination  it shows the chief minister indulging in horsetrading  thirdly the 28th march was three days away from 1st april the speaker had not certified the appropriation bill and the governor had not  given  his  assent  on  the  1st  april  the  state  would  have  been  plunged  into  a constitutional  crisis  where  there  was  no  budget    now  the  material  is  when presidents  rule  is  imposed  when  the  majority  was  saying  that  they  failed  the budget horsetrading was going on you have a state without a budget and within 72  hours  it  would  have  plunged  into  a  constitutional  crisis  the  certificate  of  the speaker  comes  much  later  till  today  the  governor  has  not  given  his  assent democracy and federalism are the essence of the indian constitution democracy means  rule  by  majority  if  the  majority  fails  the  budget  can  a  government continue even for a minute  the mlas may be disqualified  the answer to the tenth  schedule  is  the  mlas  will  be  disqualified  and  the  government  has  to resign  because  it  has  lost  the  budget  both  things  have  to  follow    the  rule  by majority  is  defied  because  a  failed  budget  was  declared  passed  the  speaker refused to have a division he refused to test the floor  the questions which have to be answered is what if the speaker refuses to have a floor test  second is the speaker wrongly manipulates the floor by wrongly counting  the third situation is that the speaker adjourns the house and then changes the character of the floor and asks for a floor test under a new floor    one of the cardinal principles of judicial independence  is  that  courts  should  never  follow  the  ballot  box    the  bommai judgment  in  its  application  raises  questions    irrespective  of  whichever  way  the courts  decide  whether  they  revive  one  government  or  they  create  a  new government  or  they  extend  presidents  rule  continues  the  appropriation ordinance has to be made into an act because there is a cloud on what happened on the  18th of  march  and therefore expenditure  from  1st  april  has  to be  ratified that is a necessity and that is why we have sought that appropriation for a period of four months that is a constitutional necessity   the discussion was concluded all the demands for grants on account uttarakhand were voted in full
