  i strongly oppose the move to withdraw the bill but i fully support the  contents  of  the  bill    the  government  is  trying  to  withdraw  the  bill  on  the ground that they want to replace the ordinance by a bill by means of a piece of legislation  as per rule 110 b there is no provision to withdraw such a bill  the rule  110  says  that  the  member  in  charge of  a  bill  may at  any  stage of  the  bill move  for  leave  to  withdraw  the  bill  on  the  ground  that  the  legislative  proposal contained  in  the  bill  is  to  be  dropped    the  government  is  not  dropping  the legislative process of this bill  they are pursuing with the bill  so that provision is not applicable  rule 110 2 says that the bill is to be replaced subsequently by a new bill which substantially alters the provisions contained therein  this is the provision  by  which  the  government  is  going  to  withdraw  the  bill    my  point  is there  is  no  material  change  or  substantial  alternation  between  the  payment  of wages  amendment  bill  2016  which  was  introduced  on  15th  december  2016 and  the  proposed  bill  the  government  want  to  introduce  now      the  only  new clause which has been introduced in the new bill is clause 3 which gives effect to the  actions  taken  by  the  government  in  pursuance  of  the  implementation  of  the ordinance  i do agree with it and fully support it  my point is according to rule 1102 the government is not empowered to withdraw a bill which is not having substantial alternations in the provisions of the bill  mere repeal  of ordinance is not a material substantial alternation of the provisions of the bill
