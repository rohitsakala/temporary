  actually right  to  education  is  the dream of  dr  baba  saheb  ambedkar    so  i  think  we  are  all  taking  his  dream  forward  everybody  has  talked  about  qualified teachers   maharashtra definitely  does have qualified  teachers  but  i  think  we  need  to  take  our  teachers  in  maharashtra  to  the next level which is not just about giving them degrees of qualification but bringing in  awareness  for  the  teachers  of  different  challenges  that  todays  students  are having  just giving the teachers a degree is not good enough  sensitizing them is more  important    the  whole  message  of  sarva  shiksha  abhiyan  is  to  make  it  an inclusive education to all  the government has to bring in one more amendment in the right to education act to extend it from 614 years to 618 years  the laws are made but not implemented properly  skilling has to be genuinely inclusive a child  who  may  be  weak  in  english  may  be  weak  in  maths  or  may  be  weak  in science  but  it  is  the  teacher  who  has  to  understand  what  the  child  is  good  at  or what his or her  strengths  and  weaknesses  are   that really  makes  a good teacher  the quality of teachers training is very important because that is what really builds the true nation
