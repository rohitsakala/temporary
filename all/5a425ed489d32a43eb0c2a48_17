  all  the  four  bills  of  the gst are game changers  this will give maximum benefit to honest traders and manufacturers    they  had  to  go  for  separate  registration  for  excise  sales  tax service tax and inspectors of every department would visit them  which will be discontinued now  the gst council has also given benefit to the small traders  if  the  sale  is  upto  rs20  lakh  and  the  receipt  is  generated  gst  will  not  be applicable on that  this is a very commendable step  this will bring down tax evasion because the whole chain will be linked  i urge upon the government to solve  the  problems  arising  in  the  wake  of  the  implementation  of  this  new  tax regime  at  the  earliest  because  there  are  a  number  of  provisions  in  the  new  tax which is beyond the comprehension of any one  i wish that the honest tax payer may  not  face  any  difficulty    even  if  a  trader  has  to  file  37  returns  all  these returns will be ereturns  as such he will not require much time in filing them  however attention must be paid to the related infrastructure  textile industry is the  second  most  employment  giving  industry  in  india  as  of  now    tax  is imposed presently on readymade garment  besides textile fibre or yarn is taxed which is just 12 per cent  it is my request that if the present rate of taxation on anything comes to 23 per cent that should not be included in the 5 per cent slab and be kept in the zero per cent category  as 90 per cent people purchase cloth so tax calculation should not be done on cloth as per the readymade garment
