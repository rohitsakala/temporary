    i  fully  support  this  election  laws amendment bill 2016  it is very interesting to note that 14864 persons living in erstwhile  bangladesh  enclaves  now  amalgamated  to  indian  territory  opted  to acquire indian citizenship and 987 people out of 39 176 persons living in indian enclaves transferred to bangladesh territory opted to retain indian citizenship and settled in india in cooch behar district of west bengal  the point which i would like  to  highlight  is  the  inordinate  delay  cause  by  the  government  of  indian  in having such enabling provision empowering the election commission to have this delimitation this legislation has to be passed  otherwise these people who have opted  for  indian  citizenship  will  be  denied  the  right  to  vote    there  is  inordinate delay on the part of the government in bringing such a legislation so that political rights  of  these  persons  are  recognized    the  second  point  is  with  regard  to  the urgency  of  passing  the  bill    why  is  the  bill  not  specifying  the  date  of commencement  on  1st  september  or  with  immediate  effect    by  going  for  a gazette notification by the government of india so that the bill has to come into effect delay may take place  kindly look into this fact  another point is regarding clause 2 of the bill  i would like to know what is meant by the relevant areas  whatever  areas  are  included  and  whatever  is  excluded  definitely  all  the  areas which  have  been  ceded  to  our  country  and  which  have  been  detached  from  the country  should  come    so  the  world    relevant  is  making  some  suspicion  or confusion  so kindly clarify on that point
