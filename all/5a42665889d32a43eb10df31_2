 i feel that we all respect the labour of the  workers  and  we  see  them  closely    the  last  amendment  was  in  2007    i congratulate the government for taking this commendable step or at least doubling the amount  the ceiling should be minimum so that less than a certain would not be given  my suggestion to that government is to consider this as to why repeated amendments need to be brought in the house  while congratulating the minister i also request that if a ceiling is to be set then it should be a minimum ceiling  do not be much concerned about the maximum ceiling  for this a mechanism can be worked  out    through  you  i  would  like  to  give  suggestion  to  the  government  to find out  a  way  corelate the bonus  with the  pay  commission  recommendation   it would  be  much  better  i  think  if  it  is  also  link  with  the  industrial  development index  the profitability of any industry cannot be the basis for bonus  decisions regarding  industrial  sector  should  be  separate  from  that  of  agriculture  sector    i support this bill and conclude
