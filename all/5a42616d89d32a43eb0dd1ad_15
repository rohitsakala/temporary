  i  think  this  is  a  matter  of  great satisfaction that the nuclear programme has progressively been on the ascent  we have to  a  large  extent succeeded  in  achieving  the goals  that  we  have  set  out  for ourselves  in the last 17 or 18 months under the leadership of the present prime minister  there  have  been  a  number  of  agreements  and  mous  with  a  number  of countries  in fact whichever he has visited abroad he has always come back with something related to nuclear energy so much so that even day before yesterday on the 12th when the japanese prime minister was here there was an mou signed in atomic energy  india is the major storehouse of thorium today  in fact it is the worlds  biggest  storehouse  of  thorium    i  would  also  agree  with  you  that  we  still need to exploit the fullest potential of thorium in india  we are certainly moving in  that  direction    hon  members  mentioned  about  the  apprehensions  about  the accidents  but we in india under the leadership of eminent scientists have taken care of this part also  most of our plants are located or set up after taking care of all  these  possible  risk  factors    also  the  seismic  zone  close  to  india  is  located  in indonesia which is more than about 300 kms away   so we do not actually suffer that  kind  of  a  risk  magnitude    the  civil  nuclear  liability  damage  act  of  2010 was mentioned by on hon member  but let me use this opportunity to share with this august house that there are three or four major points which would sum up all the  concerns  as  far  as  this  act  is  concerned    first  there  is  absolutely  no compromise  on  the  priority  given  to  the  victim    second  the  liability  of  the operator to the supplier has been kept intact so that the operator can also claim it  three we have now instituted the national nuclear pool which was coming in the way  of  companion    the  disposal  of  spent  fuel  was  referred  to  of  course it  is  a major concern  but in the area of atomic energy that is something which is done in a very scientific way  there is a proper scientific methodology of dealing with the spent fuel  nuclear power corporation of india limited is under the purview of rti all the data is also put on the website  atomic energy regulatory board has been given full autonomy  all the autonomous units in the country have  to draw their salary from some exchequer therefore it does not necessarily mean that they are subjected to the governments whims and fancies  a reactor is designed after full technical and cost viability tests  over the last 60 years not a single scientist has  been  affected  by  nuclear  radiation    there  have  been  hardly  about  20  odd unnatural  deaths  but  none  of  them  due  to  nuclear  radiation    in  fact  in  some foreign  countries  nowadays  they  have  got  into  the  practice  of  bringing  up nuclear  plants  even  in  the  residential  areas    jaitpur  plant  does  not  fall  in  the seismic  zone    after  all  the  tests  the  conclusion  was  that  the  site  is  safe    so apprehensions  sometimes  occurring  spontaneously  and  sometimes  motivated  by extraneous considerations can be overcome by the collective effort of all of us as far as entry of the private sector or foreign company is concerned that has not yet been granted for reasons known to all of us  we have regular import of uranium happening from a number of countries including canada kazakhastan and russia  there is certainly no fdi clause included in this amendment  by 2020 we would be having as much as 13500 mw of nuclear power  i must admit that of course tamil  nadu  is  one  of  our  most  precious  storehouses  of  nuclear  programme kudankulam phase i will certainly start by january and second unit of phase ii by march or  april  2016   that  is  another  issue  which  is  bothering  many  of  the hon members  cause  the  policy  as  it  exists  enables  us  to  allow  50  per  cent  of  the energy share for the state tamil nadu is asking for a larger share  it is the power ministry actually which is determining how much share to go somewhere and we follow the same   as far as expertise is concerned npcil will make up for that  for example if npcil is a partner for maruti or any other concern then npcil will be the main leader  regarding gorakhpur the work has already started   the bill was passed
