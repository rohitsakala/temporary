  for  the  first  time  the agriculture  sector  itself  contributed  significantly  in  the  economic  growth  of  the country  i commend the steps being taken by the government  but if we want to implement the fasal bima yojana in a comprehensive manner we need automatic weather  stations  in  every  village    similarly  the  most  important  aspect  of  crop insurance  is  very  very  tragic   so we  need  to  start  differentiating insurance  for  a single  crop  farmer  and  for  a  three  crop  wealthy  farmer    we  need  to  change  the crop  insurance  policy  accordingly    we  have  seen  that  in  every  budget  the agricultural  credit  has  been  rising  continuously    but  the  important  question  is where this credit is going according to the report of the rbi committee the small farmer gets his 60 per cent credit from moneylenders shopkeepers and traders and only  27  per  cent  from  banks  whereas  the  rick  farmer  gets  64  per  cent  from  the banks and only 20 per cent from shopkeepers traders and moneylenders  we also review  the  district  credit  plan  and    i  was  shocked  when  i  reviewed  the  district credit  plan    for  farmers  and  agriculture  they  were  supposed  to  give  rs  2800 crore but they gave only rs700 crore  so if this situation is in my district i am sure this situation is similar all over the country  similarly we are not able to avail of  nabard  loans  properly    the  nabard  loans  to  the  farmers  or  to  the irrigation projects should be exempted from the frbm  another important thing is  agricultural  commodity  prices    it  is  decided  by  the  market  forces  and  the government  interventions   i  would  like  to  know  how  does  the  government  deal with it  we need to look at a new system and promote futures market  probably with  all  these  aadhaar  card  and  jan  dhan  yojana  instead  of  giving  subsidized rice and public distribution w can give free food coupons or direct cash transfers so that the poor can proudly buy at market prices in any store
