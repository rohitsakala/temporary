 i would like to extend special thanks to  the  hon minister  for  bringing  a  bill  for  taking  care of  such  persons  that  have none to take care of them  the number of persons suffering from mental disorders is  increasing  day  by  day  the  increasing  number  of  mental  patients  can  be attributed  to  a  number  of  factors  but  the  facility  of  mobile  and  internet  is  also responsible  for  the  situation    moreover  no  criminal  cases  should  be  registered against those who attempts to commit suicide due to mental tension  i would like to  request  the  minister  to  set  up  hospitals  in  every  state  and  doctors  should  be deployed  therein    the  facility  of  insurance  cover  should  also  be  provided  to  the mental patients so that there may be an improvement in their lives
