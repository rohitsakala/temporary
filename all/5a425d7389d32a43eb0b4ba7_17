 such a big merger is being carried out but  is  our  ministry  fully  prepared  with  the  equipments  to  run  such  an infrastructure  we are taking this step to fight in a global environment and i have an apprehension that such a big merger may turn out too big to handle are we not going to make a good bank bad by consolidating the bad banks  the rural areas in india do not have the facility of the banking sector  wherever there is overlapping of  bank  branches  they  will  be  closed  down  and  only  one  branch  of  a  bank  will remain  i think that as a result of this merger the private banks be it hdfc icici or  any  other  bank  will  have  the  benefit    it  is  necessary  that  such  a  big infrastructure  be  set  up  by  the  government  to  be  competitive  for  global environment so that in the times to come the state bank of india might be able to extend  financial  support  wherever  required  in  a  global  environment    the government must keep a vigil that banks may not fail due to this too big to handle merger  i support this bill
