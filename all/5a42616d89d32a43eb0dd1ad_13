    i  would  like  the  hon  minister  to clarify on two points  is nuclear power safe and is it cost effective  when we talk about safety we have to look into the fact that we should not set up nuclear power plants  in  those  areas  which  are  heavily  populated  and  those  which  are  prone  to natural disaster   the  nuclear  power plant  of  at village  gorakhpur is  lying  within the radius of 100 kilometers of one of the most earthquake prone belt of kangra  i would  request the hon minister that  he should  conduct  a  study  as  to  whether  the proposed plant in that area will be safe or not  we should deploy the professional people of indian origin for taking care of the safety aspect of nuclear power plants  thorium  is  found  in  abundance  in  our  country    when  we  talk  about  nuclear research are we conducting research on thorium as well  are we looking towards proper  utilization  of  thorium  so  that  we  do  not  become  dependent  on  foreign countries
