  the  juvenile  justice  board  despite  a  few positive provisions regarding adoption and so on has put forward this house a most regressive  proposal today  is  a  black  day  for  this  parliament  in  terms  of  modern jurisprudence    i  must  sadly  accuse  the  government  of  having  chosen  political expediency  over  justice   the  provision  under  clause  16  and clause 193  of  the juvenile  justice  bill  is  not  only  in  contravention  of  the  most  important fundamental rights guaranteed by our constitution but it is in conflict with its own objectives and principles  there are 472 million children in our country  only 12 per  cent  of  all  of  them  have  committed  crimes    the  number  of  children  who committed  serious  and  heinous  crimes  was  even  miniscule    how  can  we  pass  a law  that  will  jeopardise  the  other  9998  per  cent  children  in  this  country  because we  are  overreacting  or  this  government wishes  to  overreact  to  these  handful  of cases    what  this  government  should  be  doing  is  properly  implementing  the existing  provisions  for  rehabilitating  children  in  conflict  with  the  law    the government should fix the juvenile justice system and not bypass it and victimize our  children    this  law  will  predominantly  affect  the  countrys  poor  and marginalized section in our societyobcs scs sts and minorities for a majority of children in conflict with the law come from illiterate families poor homes or are even homeless  the provision  also lacks constitutional validity  the selective and unequal  treatment  of  children  violates  the  fundamental  rights  guaranteed  under article 14 and article 153 of the constitution here the equal protection of law guaranteed  under  article  14  is  gone  and  equality  before  the  law  is  also  gone  article  153  allows  the  states  to  enact  special  provisions  for  protecting  children because  they  are  vulnerable   the one  month  period given to the juvenile  justice board  for  their  preliminary  inquiry  is  absurdly  short  and  could  lead  to  a presumption  of  guilt  and  not  of  innocence  which  itself  violates  the  constitution  clause 22 of the bill exempts a child from death penalty but after being detained for  20  years he  will be  a  hardened  criminal  after  20  years  what provisions has the  government  made  to  jail  convicted  children  in  separate  facilities  from hardened  adult  criminals    i  see  nothing  in  this  bill    the  fact  is  that  even  the standards available for determining the age of a child in our country are extremely abysmal  now the fact is that there are no specific provisions or guidelines for a female  juvenile  and  nothing  for  sex offenders i  just  want  to  stress  that  this  is  an extremely  unjust  law    our  justice  should  be  about  rehabilitation  and  not  about retribution    what  is  needed  in  our  country  is  child  protection  and  development under  juvenile  law  to  be  given  sufficient  attention  and  investment    this government is starving the juvenile justice system  there has been a reduction of 55 per cent in allocations to the states i want to stress that children below the age of 18 must be saved from prison and must be protected from the regular criminal framework
