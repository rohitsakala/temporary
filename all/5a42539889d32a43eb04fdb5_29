 the members of bjp have acted in haste it was not  proper  they  should  have  allowed  the  congress  government  to  prove  if  it enjoyed  the  confidence  of  majority  votes  on  the  floor  of  the  house  who  will decide if the speaker or the judiciary is supreme shri somnath chatterjee was the true  custodian  of  democracy  who  evinced  the  judiciary  and  the  world  that  the actual  powers  of  democracy  are  vested  in  the  speaker  and  not  in  the  supreme court of india i will insist that the world never upholds any act which is against democracy  political  persons  are  responsible  for  all  such  fall  outs  therefore  i would insist that we should make our policy and our intentions clear the political system should desist from horsetrading we should not become greedy for a post or governance
