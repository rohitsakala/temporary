 though i support this bill my point which i want the hon minister to consider is that in this particular bill there is no clear mention about the drug rehabilitation centre  this bill is completely silent on care of  persons  with  mental  illness  in  the  community    my  suggestion  is  that  a provision  of  psychiatrist  or  a  clinical  psychologist  at  all  primary  healthcare centres should be made  another  point is the process of licence  i urge upon the government to consider this whole insistence on having a licence  let me remind the  hon  minister  that  these  advanced  directives  will  be  counterproductive  and this  will  lead  to  many  issues    coming  to  the  nominative  representative  the  bill needs  to  make  provision  that  at  least  one  member  needs  to  be  present  with  the patient during the inpatient treatment  it is not required that the judiciary should be  part  of  this  mental  health  review  board    my  suggestion  would  be  that  this board  should  comprise  of  independent  psychiatrists  family  care  givers  and recovered  patients    i  propose  to  create  a  board  of  visitors  at  each  hospital    as regards right to confidentiality my suggestion is that this information should only be given to the family members and that too in verbal form
