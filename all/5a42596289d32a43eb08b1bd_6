 at the outset let me say that we fully support the bill and i also congratulate the hon health minister who has brought this bill which was pending for a long time  i also take this opportunity to thank him  on  behalf  of  my  government  for  allotting  the  aiims  to  telangana  state    i would also urge upon the government to give financial sanction for the aiims in this budget only  aids affects the body the mind and the social status  most of the patients are from the lower and  middle income groups they are  made to run from  one  hospital  to  another    various  excuses  and  reasons  are  given  not  to  give treatment  this bill will effectively deal with it as it has punishment provisions for people who avoid rendering services for these people that is the most important aspect of this bill which i wholeheartedly welcome  every master health checkup has  a  hiv  test    every  diagnostic  centre  and  hospital  should  take  the  precaution that  people  who  come  for  routine  and  regular  health  check  up  also  need  to  be informed about all the tests  most of the times we see social tensions and violence after the marriage  i am finding fault with those who know about hiv but do not disclose it to the family of the innocent girl or boy  that is absolutely a crime and there should be a provision for punishment  the punishment should be much more than what we have provided in this bill  ombudsman job is very nice  most of the time people cannot go to the court and file a case  any institution engaging more than 25 people or a 50 bed hospital should have the ombudsman  i would like to add  a  provision  here  to  the  effect  that  compensation  shall  be  paid  to  the  positive person if he undergoes mental stress because of the denial of the treatment  with good nutrition we can prolong death and in some cases even prevent it  not only hiv  aids  is  also  preventable    with  these  words  i  wholeheartedly  support  the bill
