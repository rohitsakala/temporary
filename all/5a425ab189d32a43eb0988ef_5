 this act has been in vogue since 1988 but has it been able to hook any of the benami transactions  income declaration scheme has been launched this year  this bill contradicts that declaration scheme this bill is talking  about  benami  property  which  includes  movable  immovable  tangible  and intangible  how will the income tax officers have control over the black money which is going out of the country through hawala  income tax department alone cannot deal with this  there may be so many acts to deal with such actions like hawala etc  customs and excise department should also have been integrated so that  the  black  money  menace  is  tackled    the  people  who  are  embezzling  the money  are  actually  traitors of  the  country   this  bill is a  well intended bill but  i feel that this should be integrated with the hawala customs drugs etc
