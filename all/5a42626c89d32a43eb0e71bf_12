  we  have  only  five  national  waterways  even  after many  years  since  independence  and  the  state  of  these  waterways  is  not  quite satisfactory    i  would  really  say  that  this  bill  is  a  big  leap  in  this  direction    the government has announced 101 new national inland waterways and this is really a  revolutionary  step    the  sone  punpun  koshi  gandak  rivers  have  also  been included under the national waterways  we are really grateful to the government for this  our waterways were better managed before independence as we used the sone  river  as  waterway  earlier    we  would  use  canals  for  transportation  goods  this  bill  would  definitely  expedite  the  pace  of  development  of  waterways    we would  also  like  to  request  to  develop  our  old  waterways    a  big  canal  from  the sone river from dehri to patna used to be a centre of business activity earlier and it had  a  great  potential  for  navigation    similarly  the  canals  from  the  gandak  river should  also  be  included  under  the  waterways  as  these  would  facilitate transportation of goods and would also reduce pressure on roads
