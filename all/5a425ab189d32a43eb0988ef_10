  i  support  this  bill  with  certain reservations  major  recommendations  of  the  standing  committee  have  not  been taken  into  consideration  they  would  have  improved  the  bill  this  is  my  first observation black money is a menace to the indian economy and benami deals are one of the major reasons for the proliferation of black money in a big way so if we  want  to  restrict  and  prohibit  the  generation  of  black  money  definitely  the benami transactions should be dealt with in a very strict  manner the original bill benami transaction prohibition act has passed in 1988 even after 27 years no rules  have  been  framed  under  this  act  it  shows  that  the  governments  were  not sincere  in  the  operationalisation  of  the  benami  law  therefore  i  congratulate  the hon  finance  minister  at  least  this  time  this  bill  has  come  before  the  house  for consideration and we are going to pass this bill also  a very good mechanism is put  in  place  and  a  wellestablished  procedure  is  also  there    but  there  are  some clarifications  which  i  would  like  to  seek    the  first  clarification  is  regarding  the application  of  code  of  civil  procedure    section  11  and  section  19  are  totally contradictory  the adjudicating authority shall not be bound by the code of civil procedure as per section 11 of the proposed amendment bill  section 19 is totally reverse to this section  it says that the authority shall for the purpose of this act have  the  same  powers  as  are  vested  in  a  civil  court  under  the  code  of  civil procedure  1908  while  trying  a  suit    therefore  the  adjudicating  authority administrator etc are having all these powers  so the adjudicating authority and authorities  under  the  act  are  not  bound  by  the  cpc  as  far  as  the  procedure  is concerned    but  as  far  as  the  powers  are  concerned  we  are  entitled  to  all  the powers  similarly the same situation is there in regard to section 40 clause 1 and clause 2  as per clause 1 of section 40 the appellate tribunal shall not be bound by  the  procedure  laid  down  by  the  code  of  civil  procedure  1908  but  shall  be guided  by  the  principles  of  natural  justice    clause  2  of  section  40  says  that  the appellate  tribunal  shall  for  the  purpose  of  discharging  its  functions  under  this act have the same powers as were vested in a civil court under the code of civil procedure  1908    therefore  they  are  not  bound  by  the  procedure  which  is  being laid  the second clarification is regarding the appeal before the high court that is under clause 493 4 and 5  it says that if the high court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in that case it shall formulate that question  i think for the first time in the history of indian legislation we are restricting the powers  of  the  high  court    that  question  only  will  be  argued  and  decided    the high  court  is  having  inherent  powers  and  discretionary  powers    how  can  we restrict the high court that it should adjudicate only on the question of law  it is an  admitted  fact  that  the  high  court  will  entertain  an  appeal  only  if  there  is  a question  of  law    another  clarification  which  i  would  like  to  seek  is  regarding section  58    an  exemption  is  given  here  again  to  the  definition  of  benami transaction  what is a benami transaction  almost all the benami transactions are in the name of religious and charitable trusts  the fourth point on which i would like to seek  clarification  is  section 59   the power of the  central  government to issue instructions directions and orders to the authority is very interesting  what are  the  areas  where  the  directions  are  given    is  a  judicious  mind  applied  in  this provision  provision  made under section 593 is a very strange provision  the adjudicating  authority  should  be  independent    why  should  the  central government  issue  direction  and  instruction    i  am  only  seeking  clarification  on section 59 operationalisation of this act definitely depends on the political will of the government to curb benami transactions and black money
