  we  all  know that the  mandal commission  had  recommended  27 per  cent  reservation but  this  target  is  far  from achieved  we are at only 12 per cent till now  we had also demanded in this very house  that  this  commission  should  be  given  constitutional  status    it  is apprehended  that  the  government  is  trying  to  exclude  certain  castes  and  include new  castes  in  the  list  of  obcs    if  the  government  plans  to  include  some  other castes the reservation quota should be increased proportionately from 27 per cent then  we  will  have  no  objection    the  government  of  india  should  not  enact  any law  without  taking  the  state  governments  into  confidence  as  ours  is  a  federal structure  the report of castebased census has not been published till now  the obcs of the country are keenly waiting for this report  the backward classes of the country are facing injustice mainly because of the provision of creamy layer i want  that  the  limit  of  creamy  layer  should  be  done  away  with  and  backlog  of recruitment should be cleared
