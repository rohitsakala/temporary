 though this bill is very good i would like to say a few things which should be considered as suggestions not as criticism  there are about 1017 sanctioned posts of judges in courts are lying vacant  similarly there are about 2 crore 6 lakh cases pending in courts out of which 67 per cent cases are of  criminal  nature    in  such  a  scenario  how  one  can  imagine  the  expeditious disposal  of  cases  in  commercial  courts    the  government  should  think  over  this and expedite the process of appointing judges  we should form an indian judicial service  for  the  appointment  of  judges  in  the  same  way  as  the  upsc  appoints candidates for ias and ips  today there is an urgent need for improvement in our judicial delivery system so that people could get speedy justice  the government should also consider about those 67 per cent cases of criminal nature in which the fundamental  rights  of  people  as  given  in  our  constitution  often  get  violated  therefore we also need to improve our criminal justice system
