 i rise to oppose this bill in toto on two grounds    on  technical  ground  and  also  on  merits    for  what  purpose  the parliament functions  the parliament is not just for putting a stamp on the actions of the executive  the state bank of hyderabad is constituted by virtue of the state bank of hyderabad act 1956  all other four banks have been established by way of  the  state  bank  of  india  subsidiary  banks  act  1959    these  two  are  the creations of the parliament  our creations are being taken away without informing and without getting consent of the house  i feel that it is a breach of the right of the  parliament    this  is  not  a  good  practice  for  the  parliamentary  democracy    i request  and  appeal  to  the  government  to  look  into    i  am  coming  on  the  merits  the idea behind this merger is to create a big bank of worldclass size but in india we  do  not  need  very  big  banks    we  need  good  banks  to  serve  the  needs  of  the common  people    kindly  see  the  implications  of  the  merger    it  is  observed  that after  the  merger  sbi  is  having  the  largest  share  of  bad  debt    the  kerala government  is  opposing  the  merger    so  i  would  request  the  government  to kindly consider it and review its decision and go back with decentralization of the banks
