  our  institutes  are  not  only  famous in india they are famous all over the world  all the iims are working well  we want  to  declare  them  as  institutes  of  national  importance  so  that  they  can  award degrees    hence  it  will  be  a  regular  mba  and  not  a  diploma    it  will  not  be  a fellowship  but  a  phd    most  important  issue  is  that  we  are  going  to  give  them autonomy since the government believes that if we cannot trust the wise persons of  the  country  then  we  cannot trust  anybody   earlier the  government  appointed the board chairman and the search and selection committee  but now onwards the government will no longer have any role in appointment which will be done by the board of governors  earlier the minister used to be the chairman of the iim council    now  this  will  no  longer  be  the  case    besides  now  iims  would  be audited  their  annual  report  would  be  laid  on  the  table  of  the  house    after autonomy iims can have excellent faculty and give them variable package  they will be able to conduct their affairs themselves  hence it is a historical bill
