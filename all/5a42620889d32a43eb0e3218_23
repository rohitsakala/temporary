 children are deprived of their childhood due to child labour  this is a heinous crime  children do not undertake child labour on their  own  volition  they  are  forced  into  it    i  would  like  to  submit  that  these problems  have  continued  only  because  efforts  have  not  been  made  till  date  to combat  poverty    it  is  my  submission  that  maximum  efforts  should  be  made  to remove  poverty    it  would  check  child  labour    laws  do  exist  but  if  they  are implemented strictly then only child labour could be removed  through this law there would be a check on child labour
