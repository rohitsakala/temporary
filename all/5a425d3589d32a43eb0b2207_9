  i  rise  to  support  this  bill  with  certain strong  reservations    a  simple  question  which  i  would  like  to  make  before  this house  is  that  the  hon  supreme  court  has  always  alleged  against  others  that  the conflict of interest is there  that we have seen in a lot of cases  but in the case of counting the pensionable service of judges of high court judges and the supreme court the same supreme court has heard the case and disposed of the matter  is it not a conflict of interest  no direction should be given from the judiciary or from the  bench  that  this  should  be  counted  by  the  government    there  is  another interesting point to which i would like to draw the attention of the hon minister  the principal act says that only the earned leave can be encashed  but now we are making an amendment by which any leave at his credit can be encashed  again a judge shall never hold any official post after his retirement  even if a constitution amendment is required for it definitely it should come  i also want to raise two points  regarding  the  njac  bill    my  point  is  that  the  government  of  india  shall never give any comments for the reformation of the collegium  but it is ready to give comments and response for the collegium reformation process  this is totally unfair as far as parliamentary practice is concerned  we have to bring the njac bill back to the domain of parliament and it should be implemented
