  with  the  provisions  of  the  bill  coming  into effect the smaller banks would get  merged and become a single bank and would definitely  get  the  credibility  which  is  required    the  banks  which  are  getting merged and the mother bank to which these smaller banks are getting merged all are suffering from one disorder and that is npa  instead of treating the symptoms i would like to urge upon the ministry of finance to identify the disease itself  the infrastructure sector the steel industry and the power industry are mainly causing npa to banks  directly or indirectly for the npas being caused in these sectors china is  responsible   we  have the  antidumping  mechanism  in  place   there  are other  mechanisms  also  in  place  like  there  are  tariff  barriers  there  are  nontariff barriers    that  should  have  been  invoked  long  back  so  that  the  npas  would  not have been caused to the level that we are faced with now  the provisions of the bankruptcy and insolvency code will help solve the problem of the npas in this country  the state bank of india is adopting those banks which are already sick with npas  the health of the family needs to be improved by taking care of the disease per se and not just redressing the symptoms  let us diagnose that instead of always blaming china as a villain  let us also reform our own internal issues like  loan  waivers  and  others  to  address  the  issue  of  npa  in  the  interest  of  the nation
