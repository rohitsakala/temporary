 at that time only i had said that if you had referred  the bill to the standing committee it would have been passed within 23  days  but  you  did  not  pay  any  heed  to  it  the  bill  was  sent  to  the  select committee by the rajya sabha and  amendments were made to it and it has come back for our consideration here any good suggestion by the opposition should be accepted in a functional parliamentary democracy the bill should be referred to the standing committee whether they belong to coal mining or any other subject if you had adopted this procedure it would have saved time and the bill also could have been passed therefore i would like to remind the same
