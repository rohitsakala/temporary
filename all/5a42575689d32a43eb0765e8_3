 i am proud to say that our top three management institutes    abc  that  is  ahmedabad  bangalore  and  calcutta  do  compare favourably with the best institutes of the world  these three come within the top 200 management institutes in the world and now these institutes are being declared as  the  institutes  of  national  importance    the  government  has  clearly  stated  that this is done so that they can award degrees  now they will give mba and phd degrees which is a very very welcome step  also the big thing about this is that the  iims  are  being  given  complete  autonomy    since  iits  are  also  under  you  i would  urge  you  to  give  autonomy  to  the  iits  also    however  the  national  level institutions  like  aiims  and  national  law  schools  are  not  under  this  ministry  whatever  is  under  our  ministry  you  follow  this  policy  of  giving  them  autonomy which we will appreciate  there are so many private institutes of management but still  the  iims  occupy  the  top  position  which  means  that  the  institutions  set  up  by the central government are still the best in the country  i want the government to really maintain this pristine superiority which the central government institutions have  achieved    as  i  said  earlier  one  of  the  objects  mentioned  is  that  the management  education  and  research  should  reach  top  levels   but  the  research  in management has not developed so much  so i hope that this step will give  thrust to research in management education which is changing every day  similarly it is also necessary for management experts to become itenabled  now the question is that government has not put any control on the fees  apart from that now already the fees of iims are very high and unless the students get scholarship or education loans  of  around  rs  20  lakh  it  is  not  possible  for  a  bright  boy  even  if  he  has cracked  the  common  admission  test  cat  for  iims    i  would  like  more scholarships  to  be  instituted  by  the  iims  so  that  no  bright  student  is  denied management  education    please  ensure  this  so  that  money  does  not  become  a stumbling block for pursuing management studies  i hope that management in our country  will improve  and  india  will become  a  big  economic  power in another  10 years
