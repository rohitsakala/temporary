  this  bill  is  a  revolutionary  approach towards  the  mental  healthcare    though  it  is  not  foolproof    when  this  bill  will become an act it will be of great help to change the general public attitude toward pmi persons  it will prevent public to call them lunatic  it is highly appreciable that  the  bill  guarantees  certain  human  and  social  rights  to  pmi  persons  and  the right  to  easily  access  affordable  good  quality  minimum  healthcare  upto  the district level   the bill does not give any directive about what is the next thing to be done when the person is recovered from attempt to suicide another good thing is about insurance coverage  for the mentally ill patients who is going to decide he  or  she  is  in  solid mental  condition  to give  consent  regarding  admission place and type of treatment  that is a real fallacy in this bill  the bill does not address the  old  people  regarding  property  management  of  the  pmi  persons    this  is  the bill which invited 124 amendments in rajya sabha
