  after  going  through  this  bill  i  feel  that  it  is not  going  to  be  simplified  but  it  is  further  going  to  be  complicated    i  think  the hon  law  minister  should  withdraw  this  amendment  bill  and  come  with  a comprehensive  legislation  with  regard  to  the  salaries  and  allowances  of  both  the high  court  judges  and  the  supreme  court  judges    there  are  28  clauses  to  this bill  i am unable to understand each clause as a member of parliament and also as an  advocate  earlier    it  is  a  fact  that  10  years  service  as  a  practising  advocate  is necessary  to  become  a  high  court  judge    tomorrow  some  judge  who  had  been elevated from the bar after retirement can say that he practised for 32 years and he was elevated to the high court judge and so his 32 years of practising advocate service should be counted as his service  only for the reason of that judgment we should  not  come  forward  with  amending  the  main  acts    i  am  not  against increasing their salaries or pension  i feel that this legislation may not resolve the complex issue that is before us  hon law minister should withdraw this bill and come with a comprehensive legislation and that legislation may be referred to the standing committee on law and justice  after a thorough study we can pass that legislation
