 some  members  were  saying  that  the  actual  expenditure  has  come  down  is  not correct  from 2010 to 2014 the average expenditure per year was rs 94599 crore but these two years rs 223565 crore is  the average expenditure  i am not happy with this expenditure  i am not satisfied also because we need money  housing for all by 2022 is not an easy thing  it requires a huge amount  i am also thankful to some  of  the  members  that  they  made  a  request  to  the  finance  minister  also    i myself  am  pursuing  the  finance  minister  to  make  more  allocation  for  the  housing sector  but the fact of the matter is that the state has to send the proposal  there is a  committee  where  the  representative  of  the  state  government  is  also  there    the task of the committee is to find out whether these proposals are in order or not  i have  not  made  a  single  change  in  any  of  the  proposals  made  by  any  state    some states for their own reason have not even signed the memorandum of agreement  they have to identify the cities which have to be covered  they have to identify the land  i must put it on record that if some states are lagging behind i myself have spoken to the chief ministers of those states  some of our friends were saying that i am changing frequently the size of the cities and all  now it has been decided that this  will  be  covered  in  all  the  notified  towns  across  the  country    secondly  states have to do their home work  i can only sanction  money   the execution has to be done by the state governments and the related agencies  some of the members also made  this  important  point  saying  that  without  creating  basic  infrastructure  and facilities  people  would  naturally  not  go  and  occupy  those  houses    under  the jnnurm  22  per  cent  of  the  houses  which  are  constructed  are  unoccupied    the reason  is  the  lack  of  infrastructure  and  lack  of  proper  planning    so  having  learnt lessons of the jnnurm we have advised the states to please take care of all these aspects before proposing a scheme  that is one of the reasons for the states taking some  time  also  with  regard to  the proposals bihar has  sent proposals  for 30126 houses    we  have  accepted  those  proposals  as  it  is    chhattisgarh  sent  12670   gujarat  sent  66983  jharkhand  send  16522  we  have  accepted  it  as  it  is    money also is released in proportion  we release the first installment once that is spent the second  installment  also  is  automatically  released    similarly  other  states  have  also sent  proposals  and  we  accepted  all  their  proposals  as  it  is    i  can  share  with  my karnataka  friends  that  karnataka  proposals  came  late    i  have  instructed  my secretary  to  consult  the  state  if necessary have  clarifications  and approve  them  in the  same  meeting    that  was  done    i  can  assure  all  the  members  that  there  is  no question of showing any discrimination  with regard of jnnurm within the short period of this nda government of not even two years the total number of houses we have sanctioned is 703186  this is a record  our ultimate idea is that by the time  of  celebration  of  75  years  of  independence  that  is  by  2022  we  would  like  to provide  housing  for  all    both  the  urban  development  ministry  and  the  rural development  ministry  are  working  together    with  regard  to  slum  dwellers  they will be rehabilitated in the same place in an improved habitat atmosphere  rs one lakh  for  each  slum  house  will  be  given  to  the  states  and  the  states  have  to  put  in some  matching  grant    with  regard  to  registration  of  houses  in  pmay  the  houses that are constructed will be registered in the name of female members  our target is to  construct  18  crore  by  2022  in  a  short  span  of  five  months  we  have  approved construction of 683724 houses  compared to the earlier allocation rs 5400 crore have  been  allocated    i  hope  our  states  would  be  able  to  spend  the  money  and  i would be able to demand more money from the finance minister  housing cannot be  done  by  the  central  government  or  the  state  government  alone  the  private sector also has to get into this in a big way  so i appeal to the private sector also to join  the  housing  programme  in  a  big  way    with  regard  to  the  real  estate regulation  and  development  bill  has  been  notified  on  the  1st  may    my department under the chairmanship of secretary is working about the model rules  once  the  model  rules  are  finalised  within  two  months  they  will  be  sent  to  all  the states    states  have  also  to  finalise  the  rules  and  then  they  have  to  appoint  the regulatory authority  once the regulatory authority comes into operation action can  be  taken  against  these  erring  defaulters    there  is  concern  expressed  by  many members that they are not taken into confidence  we are working out with a system wherein the mps also will have some say with regard to identification and also with regard to monitoring of the scheme  with regard to deendayal antyodaya yojana national urban livelihood mission nulm it is extended from 789 cities to all the towns  across  the  country    street  vendors  act  is  a  very  progressive  piece  of legislation but unfortunately in the act it is said that the rules will be made by the states    so  far  its  performance  is  not  satisfactory    i  only  hope  that  the  states  will take immediate steps  about rs 725 crore of fund sanctioned is currently available with  the  states  in  this  regard  for  the  homeless  and  shelters  also    ease  of construction  single  window  clearance  is  another  important  thing    i  have  taken  an initiative  and  had  a  meeting  with  six  of  my  colleagues  around  six  or  seven  times  we  all  sat  together  to  take  steps  for  a  single  window  approval  mechanism  for housing  project    i  am  very  happy  that  all  the  central  government  agencies  have agreed  to  create  certain  bench  marks  and  also  the  ministry  of  civil  aviation  has come  out  with  their  help    with  colour  coding  maps  so  that  very  municipal coporation would be able to understand what is permitted  with regard to defense 28 airports with civilian enclaves would also be given colourcoded zonal notified  with regard to environmental safeguards for incorporation of bylaws the ministry of environment has issued a notification with predefined objectives of monitorable environmental  safeguards  and  conditions  for  buildings  of  different  sizes    lastly  i would  only  say  that  recently  we  have  issued  instructions  for  delhi  and  had  a workshop also  in delhi the applications for housing plans would online only  as regards mumbai i am having a meeting with the chief minister on 6th of this month where we are going to issue guidelines for mumbai also  once delhi and mumbai show a roadmap for others i hope and urge upon all the members of parliament to impress  upon  their  municipal  bodies  as  also  state  governments  to  see  that permission is given within the stipulated period  the chief  ministers of telangana and andhra pradesh have assured in this regard  they have set up a time limit also  i  hope that  every  state  would  set  up a time  limit  of 30  days  to 60  days  maximum  there  are  a  lot  of  other  issues  but  due  to  paucity  of  time  i  would  not  be  able  to touch them  i am thankful to the hon members for the suggestions which they have given  i have taken note of them  our endeavour is to live up to the expectations of the  people    i  seek  the  cooperation  of  the  states  and  urban  local  bodies  in  this endeavour    the discussion was concluded all the cut motions were put and negatived all the demands for grants were voted in full
