 it is a very perfect bill it is a customer friendly legislation  further transparency and accountability are being brought in  as far as the fraudulent developers and promoters are concerned they can be well controlled in this bill i support this bill  when the construction takes place there is rampant and continued destruction of land trees and plants  a considerable area should be earmarked for green plantation  a very little is being given in the name of  emergency  provision    so  i  would  submit  that  a  considerable  space  may  be allotted  for  emergency  services    my  last  point  is  about  the  preservation  and protection of cultivable lands  it should be taken care of  by the hon minister
