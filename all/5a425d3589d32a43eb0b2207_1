 we all know that the birth of this bill took place because the supreme court asked the government to review the salaries and pensions of the supreme court judges we all know that our judiciary is under tremendous strain  there is no doubt that judges should be very well paid  that is the only way you can stop all these rumours and claims that are circulating in the open society today that our judges are corrupt  as far as i understand this bill is slightly complex  there are two streams through which people are coming up  as judges  one is from the subordinate judiciary  there are other judges who come up  because  of  certain  other  abilities      this  bill  tries  to  equate  a  judge  with  that judge  who has come up from the grind instead adding ten years as bonus service period  for  that  judge  who  has  not  come  through  the  grind    this  is  unequal  and unjust the post of chief justice is transferable across the states  the government should take up the responsibility of his pension liability  they do not have a state cadre  while they are in service the salaries can be paid for by the relevant states but their pension should be borne by the central government  in all the 24 high courts in  the  country  have 445 lakh  pending  cases   the lower  courts across the country have 24 crore pending cases  subordinate judiciary in this country  must be strengthened  a case filed against a family destroys the whole family destroys the peace destroys their economy  this happens only in india because of justice delivery system has collapsed at the lower level
