 i would like the hon minister to consider a few suggestions    firstly  the  two  members  to  be  appointed  by  the  government  the central government and one of the state government  amongst these members the government may please ensure that they are from academic background with academic  excellence    these  are  supposed  to  be  institutions  of  educational excellence  they should have extension centers in rural areas and backward areas and isolated areas otherwise excellence will remain confined to a few urban areas and a few rich people  the medium of instruction in those institutes is english  a large  section  of  our  population  does  not  understand  english    therefore  the children should be taught in their own mother tongue  i request the hon minister to  kindly  take  this  aspect  also  in  view    the  board  itself  would  appoint  its  own chairperson  this is a good thing but who will appoint the board this thing should be clear  there will be 19 members in the board out of which one member each will be appointed by the central government and state government  but who will appoint  the  remaining  19  members  this  should  also  be  made  clear  in  the  bill  there is provision in the bill that relates to appointment of teaching faculty  the faculty  plays  an  important  role  in  technical  institutes    therefore  the  people belonging to weaker sections like minorities and people of rural areas should also given  proper  representation  in  it    so  there  should  be  reservation  in  board  of governors and teaching faculty as per the government policy otherwise the very intent  of  the  bill  would  be  defeated    the  fee  in  these  iims  is  very  high  so  the government should give 100 per cent exemption in fees for the students belonging to bpl families and weaker sections  the government should bear the burden of their fees only then there would be justice with the talented students of rural areas  similarly the students belonging to poor families and deprived sections of society and of rural areas should be given reservation at the time of campus placement in these institutes
