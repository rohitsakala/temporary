  the  introduction  of  value  addition tax  at  the  centre  and  the  states  was  one  of  the  major  improvements  in  postindependence  india  customers  and  traders  are  all  being  burdened  with  so  many taxes so definitely it is the need of the hour that there should be a uniform pattern of tax structure not only in indirect tax sector but in direct tax sector also gst is not  simply  a  vat  plus  service  tax  but  it  is  an  improved  form  of  the  existing system of vat the first clarification i would like to have from the hon minister is regarding alcohol and petrol the long pending demand of almost all the states is that alcohol and petrol should be exempted from the imposition of gst but the 73rd committee report stated that no goods should be constitutionally kept outside the purview of gst the revenue concerns of the states have not been taken into consideration  in  respect  of  petrol  i  appreciate  the  fact  that  alcohol  is  exempted similarly  petrol  has  to  be  exempted  from  the  purview  of  gst  i  urge  upon  the government  for  devolution  of  net  proceeds  of  integrated  gst  also  to  be  done through the finance commission not by legislation by the union government
