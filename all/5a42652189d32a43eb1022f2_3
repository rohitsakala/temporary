  i  thank  that  a  good  definition  has  been made by adding in clause 2 or a warehouse shall be inserted  after the words area of  customs  station    under  subsection  2  of  the  bill  the  proper  officer  has  not been defined this proper officer has to be defined  in case of failure to give the information to the proper officer a fine of rs100 for each day has been stipulated which  i  would  say  is  a  lesser  punishment    a  fine  of  rs100  is  not  enough  and penalty  should  be  increased    as  far  as  clause  8  of  the  central  excise  act  is concerned after section 3a insertion of section 3b 1 delegates excessive power and this is capable of being abused  we are making constructive criticism on this bill giving whatever suggestions we have  we are not as such opposing the bill  i just want to clarify the situation  being a consequential legislation it is needed to be  enacted    i  hope  that  the  hon  minister  of  finance  will  take  care  of  the  points which i have made  if the power vested with the central excise customs police etc is absolute if  you give them unrestricted power the power is supposed to be abused on so many collateral considerations  therefore i would request the hon minister to give some safeguards in the bill  a safeguard should be given so that no officer arbitrarily exercises the power
