  the  bill  inter  alia  empowers  the  central government to increase the authorized capital of the national bank from rs5000 crore to rs30000 crore  this is timely and needed and hence i welcome this bill  this is a good bill which will help the farmers of the entire country who are very much in need of financial support from the government  the first and foremost of my suggestions to the government is that the word farmer may be incorporated in the name of nabard making the name and style of nabard as national bank for farmers agriculture and rural development  i also suggest that the farmers welfare  board  of  india  be  constituted  immediately  to  look  into  the  issues  of farmers    further  i  would  like  to  suggest  that  financial  support  shall  also  be extended  to  other  major  irrigation  projects  taken  up  by  the  state  government  i therefore  urge  upon  the  government  to  release  adequate  funds  to  the  tune  of rs2000  crore  to  the  state  of  andhra  pradesh  under  nabards  green  climate fund  and  also  request  the  government  to  allocate  more  funds  under  nabards csr funds so as to utilize these funds for development works  the other important issue to which i would like to draw the attention of the government is that some of the  primary  agriculture  cooperative  societies  pacs  are  reeling  through financial constraints  i would request the government that funds for the same may be  sanctioned    nabard  should  encourage  formation  of  more  farm  producer organization  fpo    similarly  refinance  limit  for  cooperative  banks  by nabard be increased from existing 40 per cent to 60 per cent  i therefore urge upon  the  government  to  implement  the  recommendations  made  by  the  standing committee  on  finance    further  the  participation  of  at  least  three  mps  from  the lok  sabha  and  two  mps  from  the  rajya  sabha  be  included  as  members  of  the board  for  a  term  of  two  years    another  submission  to  the  government  is  that  a regional office of nabard be established at amravati
