 this bill in fact is the need of the hour  with this  bill  it  will  improve  the  faith  of  the  investors  in  legal  culture  of  the  nation improve  the  international  image  of  the  indian  justice  delivery  system  and consequently  it  will  accelerate  the  economic  growth  of  the  country    in  the globalized  economy  and  in  the  international  trade  the  commercial  disputes  have increased to a large extent  we need specialized courts for this purpose  all over the world the specialized courts have been set up and we are far behind for setting up  of  these  specialized  courts    i  congratulate  hon  law  minister  that  six  months time  has  been  provided  to  dispose  of  the  matter    the  commercial  courts  are proposed to overcome the delay in judicial process and so far the government of india  is  committed  to  create  an  fdi  friendly  environment  to  attract  more  foreign investment in economic growth of the country  now this bill creates courts where the original jurisdiction of the high court is also there  so my suggestion to the hon  law  minister  is  that  the  original  jurisdiction  of  all  the  high  courts  may  be repealed  and  uniform  jurisdiction  of  all  the  high  courts  to  be  created  in  the country  again we have to evolve a transparent method of appointment of judges and appoint those judges having specialised knowledge in commercial law  apart from this in advanced countries like european and american countries process of prelitigation mediation is there  but in our country we are not finding any law  if this  process  and  this  provision  is  taken  into  consideration  at  least  like  in  other countries in our country also we can mitigate these grievances to a large extent and around 75 percent cases can be reduced  my suggestion to the hon law minister is  that  we  can  include  all  acts  which  are  dealing  with  the  commercial  disputes  those acts can be clubbed together and can be made as a part of the schedule of this  bill    apart  from  that  we  have  to  take  into  account  that  we  establish  these courts  on  pilot  basis    not  only  this  we  have  to  create  the  state  of  the  art infrastructure  and  human  resources  including  judges  and  staff    if  we  have specialized  courts  then  our  justice  delivery  system  will  also  be  of  international level    as  a  result  the  fdi  will  increase  and  consequently  the  economy  of  the country will grow  so far as the criminal justice delivery system is concerned it is the sovereign duty of the government but so far as civil justice delivery system is concerned it is a service being rendered by the government so for that service the government should be compensated suitably for this purpose a professional cost accounting wing should be established in every high court  it should assess the  amount  to  be  charged  and  how  much  court  fees  needs  to  be  levied  from  a particular litigant  or it  may fix a common court fee for this purpose  the cost should be provided for seeking an adjournment and it should increase gradually  if one approaches for arbitration then the sunset clause should be there  the verdict given by the arbitrator should also be binding on him
