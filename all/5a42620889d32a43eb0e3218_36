  the  age  under  the  child labour act has been raised from 14 years to 18 years  i thank you and the concept of adolescence has been introduced  for both the points we appreciate the hon minister  unless the right to education is coupled with the child labour act the purpose would be defeated  allowing the child after 14 years and up to 18 years to work  in  the  family  enterprises  may  not  serve  any  big  purpose    if  we  want  to realize the purpose of the child labour act then strengthening of infrastructure in the indian transit schools is extremely important  incentives for good parents have to  be  given  where  they  are  not  allowing  the  child  to  work  and  similarly  a  mild punishment  should  also  be  given  to  parents  if  they  are  caught  for  child  labour  children  from  two  to  six  years  should  also  be  considered  under  the  labour  act  unless the interdepartmental  monitoring mechanism  is  evolved the  bill  will  not serve any purpose
