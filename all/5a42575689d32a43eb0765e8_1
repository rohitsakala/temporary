  i  would  like  to  thank  the minister for his eloquent introduction of this bill  i do have some concerns  the larger  point  is  that  we  have  in  our  country  a  potential  demographic  dividend because of our youthful population but it is very clear that if we do not revitalize our  education  sector  particularly  higher  education  sector  this  demographic dividend potentially will transform into a demographic disaster  we have seen the consequences  of  that  in  our  tribal  areas  with  the  maoist  movement  the  naxalite movement    the  problem  lies  at  heart  in  this  governments  inability  or unwillingness  to  provide  the  necessary  resources  required  to  be  able  to  drive  our higher education sector towards the demographic dividend  what have we seen in the share of budgetary outlay towards education  in the most recent budget it was stagnant at only 37 per cent and only a meager 15 per cent has been allocated to higher  education    only  three  of  our  iims  feature  in  the  list  of  top100 management  schools  in  the  world  as  per  2017  financial  times  ranking    when you  have  an  institution  of  national  importance  it  must  also  be  an  institution  of budgetary  importance    the  government  launched  the  pandit  madan  mohan malaviya national mission on teachers and training  there is no progress in the establishment  of  centres  in  the  universities  and  a  tiny  fraction  of  the  fund  has been utilized since 2014  26 per cent of faculty posts in the iims and 35 per cent of  faculty  in  the  iits  are  lying  vacant    for  quality  we  need  resources  we  need money we need facilities and we need faculty  the government has also delayed the implementation of the higher education financing agency  the story of our countrys  economic  resurgence  would  be  incomplete  without  acknowledging  the critical  role  collectively  played  by  the  iims    these  have  realized  the  hopes  and vision of the man who established the iims  pandit jawaharlal nehru  the bill is clearly  an  improvement  on  the  earlier  draft  that  was  circulated  by  the  ministers predecessor    i  congratulate  the  government  for  coming  up  with  a  very  farreaching  bill    i  think  it  is  really  a  remarkable  moment  when  a  government minister in our system actually surrenders power  i want to congratulate the hon minister that he has taken this step  i hope he will follow it in other institutions  one particular feature i want to congratulate the minister for is that he has insisted that the board shall comprise three women members  the coordination forum is an interesting initiative  the bill is completely silent on the issue of reservation in teaching  staff  particularly    earlier  there  was  a  specific  provision    what  is particularly  worrying  is  that  of  the  233  faculty  members  in  the  six  iims  that  we have  information  for  only  two  belong  to  the  scheduled  caste  community  and none from the scheduled tribe community  i propose that the government in its next step should have a more ambitious management education bill so that other management  institutions  can  benefit  from  these  reforms  create  a  national management university  lack of control of the government over the quantum of fees  may  lead  to disadvantages for the  marginalized  sections  in  our society   the need  of  the  nation  could  not  be  properly  met  if  students  from  poorer  families would have to undertake the burden of very heavy loans just to be able to study in a  government  institution    another  concern  is  lack  of  fulltime  directors  in  the iims    as  these  institutes  have  done  a  great  deal  for  india  i  hope  that  the government  will  see  this  bill  as  an  opportunity  to  bolster  the  potential  of  these institutes
