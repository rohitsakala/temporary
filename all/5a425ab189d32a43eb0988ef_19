  several  members  have  laid stress on a point that acting on the recommendations of the standing committee a fresh  bill  should  have  been  brought  instead  of  bringing  an  amendment  to  the original act of 1988  so if we had accepted the recommendation of the standing committee    repealed  the  1988  act  and  recreated  a new  law  in  2016 that  would have  been  granting  immunity  to  all  people  who  acquired  properties  benami between  1988  and  2016    obviously  the  acquisition  cannot  take  place  but  the penal provisions of the 1988 act also would have stood repealed  when a new act with similar provision would have come it could only apply for a penal provision to properties which are benami entered into after 2016  this move would not have been  in  larger  public  interest  particularly  if  large  amounts  of  unaccounted  and black money has been used to transact those transactions  therefore prima facie the argument looks attractive that there is a 9section law and you are inserting 71 sections  into it   as  far  as  penalizing  the guilty  people  is  concerned the  required machinery  is  being  made  operative  under  the  present  amendment  for  punitive action    moreover  whistleblowers  need  not  get  any  protection  under  this  bill because  we  have  a  specific  law  for  them  which  across  laws  applies  to  all whistleblowers  when a whistleblowers gives any information he gets protection under  the  whistleblowers  act      as  far  as  making  benami  transaction  a  noncognizable offence is concerned it has been made noncognizable because we do not  want  multiple  agencies  to  come  and  harass  the  people    the  object  is  not  to harass  them  but  the  object  is  that  there  must  be  prosecution  if  he  has  violated  a particular  law  furthermore  if  you  see  the  list  of  amendments  which  the government  has  circulated  amendment  nos  3  4  and  5  i  have  proposed  to  the hon  house  that  the  phrase  of  income  in  all  the  three  sections  wherever  it  is mentioned  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  standing  committee should be deleted and the word in the amended section would be known sources and not known sources of income  besides your suggestions regarding the right of representation through an authorized representative here also been incorporated in the bill  you then raised this whole issue of why we have these four stages that is  initiating  officer  the  acting  officer  the  adjudicating  officer  etc    we  have adopted these stages to check the misuse of power by any individual and to reduce the possibility of error   one important question which has been raised by several members  is  as  to  why  should  the  property  vest  in  the  central  government  why not  in  the  state  government    under  all  central  legislations  where  vesting  of property takes place it vests in the central government  at least i am not aware of  any  law  which  is  a  central  law  under  which  vesting  or  acquisition  takes  place but  the  property  rights  then  go  to  some  other  authority    a  legitimate  point  has been  raised  that  the  appellate  authority  has  not  been  given  a  specific  power  of staying  the  order  i  would  like  to  say    in  this  regard  that  when  an  appellate authority has a power to pass a final order the power of interim suspension of the order  which  is  inherent  in  that  power  of  appeal  irrespective  of  whether  it  is specifically  mentioned  or  not    so  far  as  the  issuing  direction  by  the  central government  is  concerned section  593  clearly  says  that  no  order  instruction  or direction under subsection i shall be issued which require the authority to decide a particular case in a particular manner  this law is not in conflict with the income tax  act  in  any  way    the  income  tax  act  deals  with  various  provisions  of taxation the powers to levy the procedures etc  this particular law deals with any benami  property  which  is  acquired  by  a  person  in  somebody  elses  name  to  be vested  in  the  central  government    so  the  two  acts  are  supplementary  to  each other  as  far  as  this  act  is  concerned    the  section  58  clearly  provides  that  the government  has  the  right  to  exempt  the  properties  registered  in  the  name  of  religious deities and religious organizations  a question has been raised that under section 53 who would be liable  is it the person who acquires the property or the person who sells the property  in this regard the language is very clear whoever enters into benami transaction and obviously both these people have entered into a benami  transaction  itself    the  last  question  was  with  regard  to  properties  in several  schedule  areas  which  are  covered  by  the  fifth  schedule  itself    this  act does  not  exempt  those  properties    but  that  exemption  would  be  available  in  the article  244  of  the  constitution    the  fifth  schedule  clause  5  clearly  says  that wherever those scheduled properties are the governor of that state has the power to exempt the operation of any central legislation to those areas  the bill as amended was passed
