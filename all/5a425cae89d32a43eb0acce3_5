  this  bill  clearly  express  of  the  intention  of  the central  government  with  regard  to  finding  a  solution  to  dispute  between  union and states under federal system  earlier alcohol was under union government and some intoxic fermentation materials were under control of state governments but with the passage of this bill the state governments will get more powers and will be  able  to  set  up  distillery  their  own  units  and  manufacturing  units    the  state governments  will  also  be  able  to  deal  with  taxes  related  to  it    some  of  our colleagues were talking about ban on alcohol presence of mafia and police torture in some states but this bill has nothing to do with all this things i am sure this bill will not lead to give rise to mafia rather will put an end to mafia  we should trust the  state  governments  in  this  regard    i  will  make  an  appeal  to  all  the  state governments to take strong decision to eradicate this evil of alcohol addiction and create new sources of income in its place
