  like  many  of  my  other colleagues  i  also  congratulate  the  hon  minister  for  bringing  out  a  wonderful legislation    in  fact  we  believe  that  prevention  is  better  than  cure    the  more vulnerable  group  is  women  and  children  who  need  a  special  focus    we  do  not have comprehensive coordinative efforts on part of the state governments and the central  government    this  only  can  result  in  effective  control  of  the  disease    i think  we  have  to  give  special  attention  to  the  female  sex  workers  particularly  at few places like mumbai and kolkata we need to have a special programme both in  terms  of  awareness  and  treatment  for  them  denial  either  for  the  treatment  or for  other  things  should  also  be  made  a  criminal  offence    instead  of  putting  the responsibility  of  ombudsman  on  to  the  state  governments  the  government  of india  should  take  its  responsibility    at  least  in  big  establishments  having  more than  100  people  some  incentive  may  be  given  to  the  companies  which  appoint exclusive nodal officers so that the awareness could be created and some redressal mechanism  could  be  evolved  in  the  company  itself    insurance  is  extremely essential and it has to be made compulsory and the premium has to be paid by the government for the simple reason that most of the victims are poor and illiterate   india has the lowest allocation in the world for health as a percentage of gdp  we should  give  more  priority  to  education  and  health    penal  action  should  be  taken against  the  doctors  who  deny  treatment  and  also  against  those  people  who  are responsible for stocking the drugs but do not do so
