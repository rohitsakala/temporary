  this  bill  intends  to protect people afflicted with mental problems and redress their suffering  the care and  protection of  the  mentally  disturbed is  the responsibility  of  our  government and  therefore  adequate  financial  provisions  should  also  be  included  in  the  bill  physical health and mental health are both equally important  in recent times there is an increasing trend of mental illness among our children and youth  so we are passing through a phase when mental illness is becoming more widespread in our society  so it is appropriate that the parliament is now accepting and upholding the  rights  of  the  mentally  ill  by  passing  this  bill    various  states  of  our  country have  their  own  mental  health  authorities    but  what  are  the  facilities  that  we provide for the mentally ill in various states  the only national institute which can  be  proud  of  is  the  nimhans  institute  at  bangalore    the  other  state government  hospitals  have  very  limited  facilities    all  the  facilities  for  their treatment  and  rehabilitating  the  mentally  ill  once  they  are  cured  are  equally important  government hospitals are overcrowded  they are like jails  i would say that the poor mental patients are subjected to worse to tortures than are even meted  out  to  prisoners    we  have  to  see  their  plight    even  when  a  patient  is certified as fully cured by a competent doctor the family members of that patient are  not  ready  to  take  him  or  her  back  home    even  after  being  cured  they  are compelled to live with other patients in a mental asylum  my  suggestion is that the  states  have  separate  mental  health  authorities  who  should  identify  the  cured                                                   original in malayalam patients  from  time  to  time  and  help  them  to  rehabilitate  and  if  possible  find employment    a  pension    amount  to  support  them  is  also  essential    there  are social problems  all kinds of drugs are within the reach of our children  so there are factors that disturb the very mental health of our children  lot many children suffer from depression  all states should have nimhans like model institutions for health care  we have to ensure that all states have qualified psychiatrists and psychologists  for this we have to increase the number of psychiatry seats in the pg courses of all medical colleges  i support this bill
