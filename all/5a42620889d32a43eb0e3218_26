  i  would  like  to  present  before  this  august house  some  of  my  concerns  regarding  the  child  labour  prohibition  and regulation  bill  i  would  like  to  highlight  the  ambiguity  in  the  definition  of children which is below 18 years as per the un convention on rights of children the  bill  contradicts  the  right  to  free  and  compulsory  education  act  2009  as legislated to fulfill article 21 of our constitution there is a flaw in the process of listing hazardous occupations by allowing the adolescents of 14 to 18 years of age in nonhazardous occupation it  is  being discrimination to those  children  who  are equally vulnerable like those who are below 14 years of age the bill is required more  measures  to  strengthen  the  role  and  accountability  of  the  enforcement machinery in terms of rescue post rescue processes and rehabilitation
