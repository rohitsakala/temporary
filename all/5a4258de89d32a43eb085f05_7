 we are happy that the government is setting up the indian  institute  of  petroleum  with  an  investment  of  rs655  crore  as  capital  and rs250 crore as endowment and declaring this institution as an institute of national importance    we  are  requesting  him  that  there  are  many  pending  issues  in  the telangana  state  also    it  is  already  mentioned  in  the  reorganization  bill  that  the indian  institute  of  management  iim  would  be  there  and  we  have  allocated  land for it but three years have passed and there is no initiation from the government side  or  the  particular  department    another  issue  is  the  horticulture  university promised under the state reorganization act 2014 which is still pending as well as  the  tribal  university    hence  i  would  like  to  request  the  ministry  to  take initiation for the establishment of a tribal university in telangana
