 the income tax has been reduced in  case  of  the  low  income  group  people  who  are  the  salaried  persons    it  is  also true that it is only the salaried class who have little chance to hide their income  i would therefore  suggest  the  hon  finance  minister  to  give  some  more  rebate  on taxes of the salaried people of lower income group  in the last two years there has been  no  expansion  of  employment  in  our  country    we  find  that  the  revenue collection has increased this year  it is mainly due to increase in excise duty on petroleum products  the government is lucky that since 2014 the price of crude oil  in  the  international  market  has  been  coming  down    but  in  spite  of  that  the government  has  been  imposing  more  and  more  excise  duty  on  petroleum products    so  we  demand  reduction  in  the  price  of  petroleum  products  in compliance with the international market  it must be reduced for the benefit of the common people of our country  now i would like to speak on npas of the banks  every year the nonperforming assets are increasing  now it is rs11 lakh crore  but  now  we  find  that  the  government  is  advocating  to  recapitalize  the  public sector banks  finally i would like to say that the people at large did not get any benefit from the demonetization
