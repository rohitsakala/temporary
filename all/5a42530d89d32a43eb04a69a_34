  this government has given a broad base for  agriculture  and  has  also  opened  vast  avenues  for  the  farmers    hon  prime minister of the country has declared that the income of farmers has to be doubled  the  government  has  also  laid  down  a  road  map  to  realize  this  objective    this government  has  also  set  up  many  soil  testing  labs  to  facilitate  the  farmers    the government  intends  to  set  up  one  thousand  such  labs  in  the  times  to  come    the madhya pradesh government under the able leadership of hon chief minister has formulated a comprehensive scheme first time in the country to double the income of farmers  madhya pradesh government has also disbursed rs4400 crore to the farmers under pradhan mantri krishi bima yojana which is the largest amount in the country  i believe that if the farmers get less than rs6000 per quintal for their crop  of  chana  and  masoor  and  less  than  rs5000  per  quintal  for  matar  and  only rs1400 per quintal for their paddy crop then they would not survive  the msp for  paddy  should  be  fixed  at  least  rs2800  to  rs3000  per  quintal    madhya pradesh government had given a bonus of rs100 per quintal to wheat growers but this  has  been  stopped  owing  to  a  national  policy  in  this  regard    unless  msp  for wheat  is  given  at  rs1800  to  rs2000  per  quintal  to  the  farmers  the  target  for doubling the income of farmers cannot be achieved  the government also need to contemplate  that  instead  of  transferring  the  subsidy  directly  into  the  accounts  of farmers with certain acres of land the farmers should be provided with necessary products  at  the  subsidized  rate  so  that  the  farmers  do  not  have  to  wait  for  the subsidy amount to purchase the inputs  there is a need to work more in the field of drip irrigation  there is also need to link mnrega  scheme with the ministry of agriculture  if it is done the farmers can be given jobs for 365 days in a year instead  of  guarantying  150  days  job  for  farmers  under  mnrega    the government also need to think that the agriculture holdings need to be increased  if  a  farmer  has  got  10  acres  of  agriculture  land  then  he  should  not  be  allowed  to sell  his  agriculture  land  because  the  small  farmers  tend  to  take  up  other occupations leaving the farming  therefore there should be a complete ban on the sale of agriculture land by the farmers owning less than 10 acres
