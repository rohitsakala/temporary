  hon members objection is predominantly borne out  of  the  language  of  article  1101    the  critical  word  according  to  an  hon member is the word only and that is how another hon member supports him that it  is  only  the  taxation  proposals  and  nothing  else  which  is  incidental  really  can find a place as far as the money bill is concerned  with regard to this word only right from the inception of this house as to what is the width that this word only permits has been a subject matter of debate  mr mavalankar in his first ruling on this subject gave the thrust on the point that you cannot have a bill which says that the  government  shall  spend  rs100  thousand    how  that  is  to  be  spent  the incidental  provisions  will  have  to  be  contained    the  fact  is  that  these  incidental provisions to the principal provision exist do not render a bill to be a nonmoney bill  that is what mr mavalankar said  therefore the word only has to be read in the  context of the spirit of  article  110    it is  much  ado  about nothing that  you say  40  laws  are  being  amended    what  is  the  amendment    the  amendments  are incidental  to  the  acts  in  fact  these  amendments  relates  to  minor  changes  in  the original acts  the hon members also say how is electoral bonds a money bill  in the  budget  announcement  we  came  out  with  a  proposal  that  there  will  be  an income  tax  incentive  involved  in  four  different  ways    these  are  all  amendments under the income tax act and the specific provision of the income tax act which deals with this is section 13a  in the finance bill this is clause 11  these are all incidental  announcements  to  that  entire  scheme  which  has  been  made  under  the income  tax  act  itself    so  my  respectful  submission  is  that  it  is  squarely  in  the language of article     thereafter the speaker made the following observation
