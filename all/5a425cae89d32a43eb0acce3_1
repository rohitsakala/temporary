  the  need  for  the  enactment  of the high court and the supreme court judges salaries and conditions of service amendment bill 2015 arose because of a judgment delivered by the hon supreme court  in  a  writ  petition    we  have  been  seeing  that  an  advocate  who  has  put  in more than 20 years of service is appointed as a high court judge directly at the age of 55 or 56 years  i know some cases where the high court judge was appointed at the age of 59 or 60 years  they put in only two or three years of service  so absolutely the supreme court is justified in saying that there is some anomaly and it is the duty of the parliament to rectify that anomaly   as far as judges salary is concerned in the last 65 years only thrice the salaries of high court and supreme court  judges  have  been  increased    that  is  why  this  is  the  right  time  the government  should  think  of  increasing  the  salary  of  both  high  court  judges  as well as supreme court judges  it has got a direct impact on the pension that they are going to get  again there are about 371 vacancies in the various high courts as against sanctioned posts of 1071  secondly we are not getting efficient honest and dedicated advocates who have got lucrative work in the high courts to come forward to accept judgeship with this meager salary  unless you attract them with some good salary or some benefits you cannot expect efficient advocates who are also  honest  and  who  maintain  integrity  to  become  high  court  or  supreme  court judges  i would also request the hon minister of law  to think of bringing in the judicial accountability bill  i would also request to the union government that a circuit bench of the supreme court should be established at bengaluru  our party wholeheartedly support this bill
