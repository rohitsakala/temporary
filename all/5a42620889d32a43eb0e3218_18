 the child labour in fact is an international problem and our country is also no exception to this problem  spread of education can play a positive role in eliminating poverty from our country  therefore we cannot put an end to this problem by merely legislating laws  there are several aspects to this problem which need to be pondered over like human trafficking is taking place on a very large scale  today the railways has started an initiative called child line to  check  trafficking  of  children  through  trains    similarly  we  can  also  take  such measures  to  make  it  difficult  child  trafficking  through  road  network    today  the condition of our schools is not very good  if at all we send these children to these schools  they  cannot  shape  their  future  properly    so  there  are  many  problems which need a holistic view to find a solution to this problem and only then we can  protect  the  future  of  these  poor  children    these  children  are  our  future  assets  as they  are  capable  of  giving  new  direction  to  our  nation    the  government  has launched several schemes like the jan dhan yojana mudra banking etc to remove poverty  in  our  country     finally we  hope  that this law as amended  would  go  a long way in prohibiting child labour in our country
