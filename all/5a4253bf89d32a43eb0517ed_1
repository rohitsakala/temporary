  today  the  constitution  one  hundred  and nineteenth  amendment  bill  2013  has  been  presented  to  this  august  house  to ratify  indiabangladesh  land  boundary  agreement    when  the  radcliffe  award was signed it was decided that a 4096 km long boundary will be drawn between india  and  east  pakistan    out  of  that  262  km  stretch  would  be  with  assam  856 km  with  tripura 318  km  with  mizoram 433  km  with  meghalaya  and  2217 km long  boundary  would  be  drawn  with  west  bengal    however  complete demarcation could not be done and problems cropped up in those enclaves where indians and bangladeshis were scattered  many attempts were made to solve these problems but to no avail  in december 1949 an indopakistan boundary dispute tribunal was set up but no solution could be found  thereafter on 10 september 1958  the  nehrunoon  pact  was  signed  on  16th  may  1974  indiramujib  treaty was  signed  in  delhi    the  parliament  of  india  is  trying  to  ratify  the  pact  after  so many  years  by  passing  this  bill    today  in  the  interest  of  west  bengal  and  the entire  country  when  we  are  going  to  usher  in  a  new  era  by  ratifying  the  indiramujib  pact  as  well  as  the  treaty  signed  by  shri  manmohan  singh  and  sheikh hasina  on  6th  september  2011  we  must  look  into  every  aspect  people  of  india and bangladesh want to see development in both the sides of padma  they want jobs  for the  jobless education  for the  illiterates  and  food  for the  hapless   thus i also have some demands to put forth firstly we need access to road  the entire north eastern region has to take a detour via siliguri  i demand the road access rail access and river access or sea link  i hope that the government will definitely sign  some  more  pacts  to  this  effect  after  the  passage  of  this  bill  we  are  making promises that whoever will come from the other side of the boundary will be given indian  citizenship  but  i  demand  that  not  only  citizenship but  all  other  rights  and facilities  like  aadhar  card  voter  card  gas  connection  and  the  new  insurance scheme jan dhan account educational rights infrastructure etc while supporting this bill i demand that dahagram and angraopte should remain a part of india and teenbigha corridor should be done away with  a new tetulia corridor should be created because if i need to go to teesta point from dashparachopra via siliguri the distnace in 117 km but if we use tetulia corridor it comes down to 26 km  if immigration corridor is made functional then the distance will be reduced to 26 km from 56 km
