 if black money and benami property is  not  wiped  out  honest  and  middle  class  person  cannot  indulge  into  election politics that is why i congratulate the government political parties do not want to touch these things the congress party might have brought this act originally but it did not utilize it this is the biggest example of political will such a law is the yardstick  of  change  that  is  brought  about  through  a  change  in  government  such decisions  shake  up  governments  as  the  persons  having  property  are  not  ordinary persons    aadhaar  numbers  should  be  linked  with  registry  so  that  if  i  have  ten properties this number will reflect all my ten properties and the remaining benami properties will be exposed one day or the other i feel that three things are a must in this regard such as linking of aadhaar number with registry will be an effective way to reveal the benami property the second measure is to make it mandatory to declare properties while filing income tax there is no mention in this bill about the properties of the mutt and the temples will the trust operating for thousands of years in which the name of any person has not been mentioned get protection i feel  that  it  should  be  kept  into  view  i  support  this  bill  congratulating  the government  it  will  be  a  history  before  the  coming  generation  that  the  thing initiated in the year 1882 has finally been settled in the year 2016
