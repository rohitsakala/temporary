  we have been making laws since our independence to protect the children from child labour but we have not been able to get rid of this problem till today  actually it is the parents of a child  that are mainly  responsible  for  the  exploitation  of  their  child    therefore  we  need  to legislate  a  law  to  create  awareness  among  parents  in  order  to  make  them  aware about  their  responsibility  towards  their  children    there  is  no  doubt  that  the government cannot shirk its responsibility but at the same time it is also necessary to  make  realize  the  irresponsible  parents  towards  their  responsibility  to  their children  therefore there is a need to take a positive initiative by the government in this direction
