  regarding  this  bill  some  concerns were  raised  and  some  apprehensions  were  also  expressed  somebody  said  that  we were  kneeling  before  america  or  china    i  fail  to  understand  how  by  bringing  a regional  centre  of  biotechnology  in  the  country  which  is  going  to  be  one  of  the stateoftheart things for the whole of asia we are seen as kneeling before america or china  we can tell the hon members that we shall be the last people in this world to ever kneel before anyone  this bill has its origin from the time of our great prime minister shri atal bihari vajpayee  he became the prime minister of india and you know  what  he  did  on  11th  may  1998  in  spite  of  all  pressures  for  which  i  think anybody  could  have  been  seen  kneeling    now  there  is  another  great  leader  our present  prime  minister    who  enjoys  the  legacy  of  that  great  prime  minister    he  is committed to promote science in the best possible manner  that is reflected in all the policies  that  he  has  framed  till  now  and  the  various  programmes  which  were deliberated in great detail whether it was the make in india or the digital india or the swachh bharat  etc  members have expressed concerns and raised doubts that probably this institution is coming up at the cost of other institutions  and it is going to hamper or impair the autonomy of other institutions  but it is not like that  it is an institution  and  regional  centre  for  this  region  of  the  world  that  is  asia    this centre with the help of unesco and the memberstates is going to actually make sure that our goal of taking biotechnology is achieved well in time  one hon member said  that  the  achievements  of  biotechnology  or  of  our  scientists  in  this  field  in  our country  are  literally  zero    but  i  can  say  for  sure  that  we  have  the  stateofthe  art laboratories  in  this  country  in  biotechnology    our  molecular  biologists  or  life scientists  have  done  the  total  human  genome  sequencing    this  human  genome sequencing required ten years back 100 million dollars  now after ten years the same human genome sequencing can be done in thousand dollars  this is the achievement of our scientists  cancer is no longer a dreaded disease  somebody said that we have not done anything in nanotechnology  but i want to tell that right now our status in nanotechnology  internationally  is  that  we  are  the  third  best  in  the  world  in  terms  of our  publications  and  our  contributions    i  can  assure  you  that  the  coming  up  of  this institution  is  not  going  to  in  anyway  compromise  the  quality  the  support  that  the government  of  india gives  to  any  other  institution whether  in  the  government  or  in the private sector or in the industry  coming up of this institution will ensure that we have a very good quality state of the art institution which will make sure that we are able  to  take  care  of  whatever  is  deficient  anywhere  we  improve  educaton  we improve  training  and  we  create  manpower  of  all  types  all  levels    some  concerns were also raised about ignoring east or north eastern parts  but i want to tell that we already  have  an  institute  of  biotechnology  in  kalyani  west  bengal    at  our  lab  in lucknow  along  with  the  agriculture  department  of  west  bengal  we  have successfully worked  on  arsenic  free rice  now    so  it  is  not  that we  are not  showing our  concern  for  the  eastern  or  northeastern  part  of  india    we  also  have  a  very important major agricultural programme in the east and the northeast  there is an initiative  which  is  known  as  the  institute  of  bioresources  and  sustainable development at imphal  something was mentioned about bt cotton and bt brinjal  let me tell the factual position about these issues  bt cotton is the only genetically engineered crop which india has approved so far for commercial cultivation in 2002 when  atalji  was  the  prime  minister    so  far  india  has  approved  six  events  of  bt cotton    at  present  india  is  the  number  one  cotton  producing  country  in  the  world surpassing even the usa and china  now let me tell about bt brinjal  after several years of biosafety testing the genetic engineering appraisal committee has cleared the bt brinjal for commercialization in 2009  there was a concern raised a member about the biotechnology regulatory bill  i can tell you that we are  going to bring that regulatory  bill    moreover  we  are  not  compromising  on  any  of  the  regulatory mechanisms  even  without  the  bill  right  now    some  issue  was  raised  about  the majority voting right about the indian members and all  the majority voting rights in  the  board of  governors  is with  the indian  members    somebody  mentioned  about the  economic  benefits  to  the  country    the  centre  is  expected  to  produce  highly trained  and  skilled  manpower  capable  of  delivering  lowcost  effective  healthcare agricultural  and  veterinary  technologies    somebody  mentioned  about  industry collaboration etc  i can tell you that one of the mandates is education will be linked with industry requirements  the foreign faculty etc are going  to be involved in this  there  was  a  suggestion  given  that  the  review  should  be  every  two  years    we  can actively consider that  a member asked about unesco  unesco is not going to provide us any fund per se but the member states will be giving contributions  there was  a  mention  about  the  generic  medicines    we  are  a  leader  in  generic  medicines  there cannot be two opinions about it but with regard to the benefits of these generic medicines we have to cover a long way to make sure that we make generic medicines available to each and every person in this country   the bill was passed
