  standards  are  extremely important  they  affect  the  consumer  and  the  economy      i  would  like  to congratulate the government and the hon minister for introducing this bill   the previous  government  also  recognized  it  credit  goes  to  them  as  well  and  they referred  it  to  the  standing  committee    the  standing  committee  has  given  about 12 recommendations  it is heartening to note that despite our political differences in rare situations like this we all come together in the interest of the country  bis certifies precious metals especially gold  the bill seeks to include standardization of services especially healthcare environment practice safety and security   there are lakhs of standards  it is practically impossible for the government to take the sole  responsibility  of  standardization  implementation  and  monitoring  and regulation of standards  so it is the responsibility of the industry and other private bodies  the bill provides for self certification  again this a very welcome move  the  bill  gives  rights  to  police  officers  above  the  rank  of  dsp  to  search  seize without  warrant    again  a  welcome  move    we  support  the  bill    bis  must promote  private  testing  laboratories  in  india    bis  is  a  shortstaffed  and  underresearched organization  many indian products still fail to get certified because the laboratories  are  not  certified    the  government  should  focus  on  the  required standards for implementing new policies and make huge investment  our quality standard  for  air  is  not  in  tune  with  the  requirement    but  i  think  this  bill  is  very important because this bill if implemented properly can add more than 3 per cent to  our  gdp    we  support  the  bill    it  affects  the  image  of  india  and  the  pride  of india in the global arena
