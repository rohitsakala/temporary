 the act was brought in 1981 by late shrimati indira  gandhi    it  was  the  result  of  her  vision  for  the  farmers  today  this amendment bill has come mainly to increase the authorized capital of nabard from  rs5000  crore  to  rs30000  crore    moreover  the  allocation  of  fund  under pmksy  is  rs1000  crore  but  he  has  released  only  rs415  crore  up  to  january 2017  so the intention of the government to help the farmers is only on paper not practical    there  is  one  of  the  slogans  of  this  government    har  khet  ko  pani  the  allocation of  rs1000  crore  is there  for  micro irrigation components  whereas the  released  amount  is  only  rs461  crore    so  the  words  of  this  government  are not  in  line  with  what  they  have  promised    under  the  tribal  development programme there is no fund sanctioned by nabard for the year 201516 in the north eastern region  in my constituency we have an area where people produce turmeric which is one of the best turmeric in the world  the farmers  approach the banks for loans but they cannot avail the loan due to the cumbersome process of banks  so i would request the government to have special consideration for these people especially in my state  in my state there is one of the rarest earths which is very good for pottery  so i would request that loans to these types of people to the small farmers should be extended so that farmers of this area will be benefited
