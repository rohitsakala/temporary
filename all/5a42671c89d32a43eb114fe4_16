    i  fully  support  this  bill  subject  to some  reservations    it  is  well  known  that  the  world  trade  organization  wto agreement  encourages  that  all  member  countries  have  to  adopt  the  international standards  and  move  towards  mutual  recognition  of  certification  systems  and  a uniform pattern has to be followed the bureau of indian standard takes  23 years even for getting the certification for a product the two reasons for the delay are first there is rigid procedural formality in getting the certification and the second reason  for  the  delay  in  getting  the  certification  is  lack  of  infrastructure  facilities we  have  to  rectify  it  in  the  wto  regime  the  quality  of  a  product  is  the  most important ingredient in the new  market especially in the neoliberal market  we have to meet and compete with the international standards  we have to review the standards  which  we  are  following  in    india  for  standardization  as  well  as certification  so  as  to  protect  the  interests  of  consumers  because  the  interests  of consumers and the quality of products are mutually related things  so we have to review  it    this  bill  widens  the  scope  of  standardization  besides  articles  and processes  goods  services  and  system  will  be  brought  under  the  regime  of standardization  it  has  widened  the  network  of  compulsory  or  mandatory standardization of products and services the mandatory certification will help the consumer  to  get  good  quality  products  as  well  as  it  prevents  the  import  of  substandard  products  from  outside  countries  especially  from  china  it  is  my submission  that  scope  of  compulsory  certification  and  mandatory  standardization of products and processes should be enlarged  we are having the food safety and standard authority of india fssai   the quality of food is being determined and assessed by it  the bureau of indian standard is also having the authority to assess the  quality  of  food  and  standardise  it so  the  multiple organization  are  doing the same  thing  which  has  to  be  avoided      i  would  like  to  seek  certain  clarifications from  the  honble  minister    nowhere  in  the  provisions  of  the  bill  is  a  mention about  the  metal  metal  articles  are  there  but  the  purity  of  the  metal  is  not  mentioned in any of the provisions  my second reservation is about the definition of  precious  metals    clause  226  says    precious  metal  means  gold  silver platinum and palladium why is diamond not included here  though diamond is not a metal but even then i would like to know whether it can also be included my  third  clarification  which  i  am  seeking  from  the  minister  is  about  clause 102c  of  chapter  iii  which  says  that  the  bureau  of  indian  standards  may recognize  or  accredit  any  institution  in  india  or  outside  which  is  engaged  in standardization    i  fully  oppose  this  provision  how  can  an  outside  agency determine and assess the standard of  a product which is being manufactured in our country
