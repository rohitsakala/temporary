  the  background  of  this  bill  is  the convention for the suppression of unlawful seizure of aircraft which was earlier signed in hague and recently in beijing  i would like to speak about clause 11 that extradition  in  every  case  creates  a  risk  of  inadequate  trial  of  the  accused  as happened in kandhar hijack in december 1999  it is only because of inadequate trial the people involved in kandhar hijack were again responsible for 911 attack in  america  as  well  as  attack  in  mumbai    this  issue  is  required  to  be  treated  as political issue also otherwise this will have serious national as well as international ramifications    at the same time the issue of compensation needs to addressed to   so unless  and  until we  make  the  compensation  clause  very  clear there  will be  a fair  amount  of  loss  to  the  people    with  these  few  suggestions  i  would  like  to support the bill
