  the  main  feature  of  the  national bank  for  agriculture  and  rural  development  act  was  to  provide  and  regulate credit  and  other  facilities  for  the  promotion  and  development  of  agriculture cottage  and  village  industries  for  execution  of  projects  under  fpf  and  wif  the common  difficulties  relate  to  delay  in  according  administration  approval  by  the state  governments  obtaining  state  government  guarantee  and  title  of  land  for mortgage  etc  but  it  has  not  been  addressed  in  this  bill    nabard  extends  refinance to banks for their agriculture lending  i would like to ask as to whether the government  has  taken  stock  of  the  funding  that  is  being  provided  by  ridf  to different  states    if  certain  states  are  utilizing  nabard  fund  for  other developmental works then the rural community is being benefited but is it directly having  an  impact  on  the  farmers    this  is  the  question  which  needs  to  be deliberated at the ministry level and also in this house  agriculture credit today is actually  the  main  issue  which  needs  to  be  deliberated    credit  disbursement  is dominated  by  commercial  banks  in  certain  states  and  in  my  state  it  is  the cooperative bank which provides the largest credit to the farmers  the government may  also  consider  taking  up  the  functioning  of  rrbs    there  has  been  an impressive growth in agriculture credit  but it is a matter of concern that the share of  term  loan  in  total  agriculture  credit  disbursed  declined  steadily  from  393  per cent in 200405 to 195 per cent in 201415  this is the main reason why we have this  much  of  problem  in  our  rural  areas  and  agro  crisis  in  our  country    the challenge before the nabard is to encourage capital formation through increased share  of  longterm  loan  in  agriculture  credit    i  am  of  the  view  that  a  thorough survey  on  credit  needs  to  farmers  for  production  cultivation  investment  and consumption  purposes  should  be  conducted  under  the  auspices  of  nabard  there  is  a  need  to  galvanise  the  district  level  bankers  committees    but  the difficulty  that  we  face  is  that  bankers  who  actually  represent  the  banks  in  the meeting  only  just  carry  the  message    they  do  not  give  any  substantial commitment in that meeting  the minister may think over it and take certain steps which will help everyone  the nabard should lend more  directly eliminating the intermediaries as far as possible so that the beneficiary ie farmer can avail of the credit in time
