  the  union  government  has  tabled four  gst  legislations  in  the  lok  sabha    10  groups  have  been  set  up  under senior tax  officials  to  examine the  concerns  of  the industry  and submit  reports by april 10th  most issues have been addressed through feedback but it was felt that some sectors having special peculiarities needed a closer look to ensure that they were able to make a glitch free shift to the gst   they have been asked to focus  in  particular  on  procedural  simplifications  and  the  rate  structure    gst will  be  the  biggest  reform  in  indian  taxation  since  1947    but  there  are  many challenges  for  its  successful  implantation    these  include  getting  acceptance from all the stakeholders the states concerned the union territories and most importantly  from  the  traders  and  small  industries  sectors    through  revenue neutral  rate  the  government  is  to  ensure  that  its  revenue  remains  the  same despite of giving tax credits  the government has already incorporated goods and services tax network gstn  we acknowledge that fundamental purpose of  gst  is  to  make  india  as  one  state  where  interstate  movement  of  goods  is common    tamil  nadu  is  concerned  about  the  impact  the  proposed  gst  will have on the fiscal autonomy of states and the huge permanent revenue loss it is likely to cause to the  manufacturing and exporting state like tamil nadu  we are  happy  that  some  of  the  concerns  raised  by  us  have  been  addressed    but however  a  number  of  concerns  of  tamil  nadu  still  need  to  be  addressed including  the  gst  council  as  a  constitutional  body  infringes  the  legislative sovereignty  of  both  the  parliament  and  the  state  legislatures  and  completely jeopardizes  the  autonomy  of  the  states  in  fiscal  matters  furthermore  the decision making role and voting weightage in the council are unacceptable the cost  of  agricultural  inputs  will  go  up  since  the  agricultural  implements fertilizers  seeds  will  also  be  taxed  at  gst  rate  of  25  per  cent    there  is  an apprehension that the implementation  of  gst  will  make the  present commercial tax department redundant  i am glad to note that the deliberations in the gst council have been open and many of the concerns raised by us have been  accommodated  in  the  spirit  of  give  and  take  we  have  successfully migrated 519 lakh dealers out of a total of 601 lakh dealers that is 86 per cent till date  we are fully geared up as far as it hardware is concerned  software customization  is  also  progressing  well    i  would  like  to  conclude  by  assuring that  tamil  nadu is  fully  committed to the  roll  out  and  successful implementation of the gst
