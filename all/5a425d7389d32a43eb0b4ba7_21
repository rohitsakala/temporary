  in the  state of kerala state  bank of  travancore was  performing  well    but  now  it  has  been  merged    the  service  of  the  sbi  in comparison  to  the  sbt  is  very  poor    it  is  now  mandatory  for  the  sbi  account holders to maintain a balance of rs 5000 in metropolitan areas  for metro areas if  the  difference  between  the  minimum  balance  and  the  actual  balance  is  50  per cent  then  the  sbi  charges  rs  50  plus  service  tax  as  penalty    if  the  shortfall  is more than 75 per cent the charges are rs 100 excluding the  service tax  people with meagre earnings will find it hard to maintain the specified balance  thus sbi is literally robbing the depositors  so i oppose the bill
