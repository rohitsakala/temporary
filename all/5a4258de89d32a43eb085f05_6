  as  far  as  energy  is  concerned  all  over  the world  with  regard  to  hydrocarbons  and  shell  gas  there  are  issues  coming  out presently  in  the  energy  sector    we  have  found  that  we  fail  in  many  of  the  wells that are dug for shell gas  this institute will give us some directive and guidance in that  regard  as  it  is  a  research institute   i  feel that  there  will  be  more  stress  on research  work  in  the  institute    when  the  shell  gas  production  started  throughout the world the risk came down and the petroleum industry are shattered a bit  the petrol companies faced losses because they had purchased the crude oil at a higher price    the  next  most  important  thing  of  the  institute  is  its  curriculum  when  we form  an  institute  of  national  importance    the  curriculum  should  be  of  a  global standard    we  should  have  a  faculty  staff  who  is  well  versed  with  the  latest technological changes to impart education of a very high quality to our students  i feel  that  mumbai  particularly  the  coastal  belt  of  mumbai  is  also  an  appropriate place for such an institute  therefore i request the government to think of setting up of an institute of national importance in mumbai also   shri  muthamsetti  srinivasa  rao  avanthi  i  convey  my sincere  thanks  to  our  chief  minister  for  granting  200  acres  of  land  the  cost  of which  comes  to  more  than  rs400  crore    in  accordance  with  13th  schedule  of andhra  pradesh  reorganization  act  2014  the  indian  institute  of  petroleum  and energy  has  been  set  up  the  institute  will  provide  high  quality  education  and conduct advance research in all aspects relating to the conventional hydrocarbons  in this connection i want to make some suggestions for the kind consideration of the  hon  minister  while  appointing  the  nongazetted  staff  he  should  give instructions to the institute to recruit local people instead of recruiting people from outside the state  i suggest to the hon minister to release funds smoothly so that the  construction  of  the  institute  takes  place  at  a  fast  pace    i  would  also  like  to request the hon minister to start an incubation centre on par with the institution so that the creative or innovative minds of the youth of this country  may be utilized for  the  development  of  this  country    moreover  we  have  to  give  training  to  the present students  to  meet  future challenges  arising out of  automation  and business activities getting more and more based on internet so that after some time they do not get insured in respect of their jobs  i would like to thank the government of india once again for sanctioning seven educational institutions in three years  it is a  great  achievement  of  our  state  after  independence  as  no  other  state  got  seven institutions  in  these  three  years    along  with  education  we  should  also  include introducing  students  to  yoga  ethical  values  culture  tradition  etc    this  is  the legacy that we can give to the future generations
