  in  any  democracy  man  primarily  seeks  the right  to  vote  which  we  are  conferring  today  to  those  indians  who  were  in  the  51                                                             original in bengali enclaves of bangladesh  now my concern is whether we are really being able to confer  this  fundamental  right  on  these  people    whenever  we  offer  the  right  to vote  right  to  shelter  automatically  follows  we  have  schemes  like  indira  awas yojana and such other schemes which can be used to provide homes to them  the land on which they are currently putting up is government land  until and unless the  pattas  of  the  land  are  handed  over  they  cannot  enjoy  the  benefits  of  the housing schemes  therefore if we are talking about rights then all such rights are involved  the  children  were  studying  in  the  schools  in  bangladesh  and  have  come here  with  transfer  certificates    but  they  are  not  getting  admission  in  indian schools  they should be immediately admitted to our institutions  otherwise they will lose precious one year  moreover people were engaged in cultivation share cropping or were bus conductors drivers grocery shop owners    hon minister of law is offering the right to vote but people also need the right  to  food  right  to  clothing  right  to  education  right  to  work  otherwise everything  becomes  meaningless    moreover  the  healthcare  facilities  should  also be  expanded in  those  areas   i  feel that  when  man  gets the  right to  vote then he exercises his right to elect his representative  the right to vote leads to another right that is  the right to fight an election as a candidate  so a persons name must be  there  in  the  voter  list  if  he  intends  to  fight  election    therefore  if  the  names have been included already in the draft list then it is okay  but if names are not there  as  yet  then  by  when  those  can  be  incorporated  should  be  made  known because  once  the  notification  is  issued  no  new  names  could  be  included    the arrangement has to be made by the government and i hope this will be done  shri  pinaki  misra  the  election  laws  amendment  bill  2016  has been  brought  to  this  house  so  that  this  house  can  give  the  right  to  franchise  to 14864  persons  living  in  the  erstwhile  bangladeshi  enclaves  which  are  now amalgamated  to  indian  territory    but  merely  giving  them  the  right  to  vote  is  not enough  article 21 of the constitution mandates that they get much more than the right to vote which is of course a fundamental right  this cabinet had approved a  rehabilitation  package  and  upgradation  of  infrastructure  in  these  enclaves  on december  2  2015  which  was  to  the  tune  of  rs1006  crore  but  the  money  is  not coming from the centre  secondly  andhra  pradesh  has  a  demand  of  this  government  to  give  them rs 5 lakh crore for a new capital  the telangana people are today complaining as are the people of odisha that the polavaram project has now affected hundreds of thousands  of  people  in  odisha  and  taken  very  very  fertile  agricultural  land  from odisha    we  have  asked  for  an  rr  package  and  that  rr  package  does  not come  from  the  central  government        i  think  that  the  hon  law  minister  must bring  it  to  the  notice  of  the  government    i  beseech  this  government  that  kindly fulfil  the  promises  that  you  have  made  to  the  states    particularly  states  like odisha are dependent on the central government and they do not have their own devices to deal with these kinds of issues
