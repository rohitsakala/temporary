have made and will implement them  i extend my thanks to shri  mukul  rai  ji  and  all  the  members  of  the  standing  committee  as  they submitted their suggestions after going through the bill in a very short time and we have formulated this bill on the basis of those suggestions  besides the transport ministers of 18 states also went through it  i would especially like to thank them  the  government  has  accepted  almost  all  the  recommendations  of  the  standing committee    some  hon  members  have  expressed  their  concerns  with  regard  to third  party  insurance    i  would  like  to  make  it  clear  in  this  regard  that  the  upper limit of the compensation amount by the claims tribunal has not been fixed and the entire compensation amount will have to be paid by the insurance companies to expedite the settlement of cases a provision of compensation of rs5 lakh has been made in the bill  the victims may accept that amount of compensation otherwise they  will  be  free  to  approach  the  claims  tribunal    this  decision  has  been  made with the intention of bringing down the cases  this bill provides for an accident victim fund which will be used in case of hitandrun incidents and for providing treatment to the injured during the golden hour  after the constitution of the fund the solatium fund will be merged into this new fund  with regard to aggregators the  states  can  formulate  their  own  policy  as  per  their  requirement    the  state governments  have  full  powers  in  this  regard    so  far  as  the  question  of  public transport  services  is  concerned  all  the  powers  have  been  conferred  on  the  state governments    the  hon  minister  of  finance  had  stated  in  his  speech  that  the government  will  launch  a  new  scheme  for  rural  transportation    we  are commercialising the lithium ion battery even normal vehicles will operate through the  lithium  ion  battery    the  old  diesel  buses

 a  number  of hon members have presented their views with regard to over loading lane driving over  speeding  and  ambulance    this  is  true  that  we  have  not  been  able  to  make available  ambulances  in  large  numbers  even  now    it  was  our  endeavour  to  keep them  at  a  distance  of  every  50  kms    we  have  created  a  red  zone  where  the number of accidents is more  our first priority is to provide ambulance service to this red zone  we have asked the sirdi sai sansthan to donate us ambulances we will  operate  them  with  their  names  disclosed  on  those  ambulances    if  any  ngo comes forward to undertake this work under csr we welcome them  we need to provide  training  with  regard  to  lane  driving  also    as  such  in  the  2000  driving

this  regard  to amend the ipc to ensure provision of stringent action  i have written a letter to the education ministers of states also requesting them to introduce some good lessons regarding  road  safety  in  primary  and  middle  schools    we  are  trying  to  spread awareness in this regard through cartoons advertisements and radio as well  the supreme court has given a verdict with regard to good samaritans  we are trying to bring in its ambit doctors and nurses also to ensure protection to them  we will issue  a  executive  order  in  this  regard    this  bill  also  provides  for  action  against those making wrong dpr of roads  the functioning of the transport check posts at the  borders  of  the  states  is  also  not  good    we  will  not  tolerate  any  type  of corruption in the transportation sector at any cost corruption will be  stamped out after  putting  in  place  online  governance    we  will  be  able  to  bring  about comprehensive  improvement  through  this  bill  in  regard  to  driving  licenses  and vehicle  registrations this  bill  will be helpful  in  providing  simplified  and  quality services  to  the  citizens    this  bill  envisages  automation  and  computerisation    it will pave the  way  for  a  wide  ranging transformation in  ruralurban  transportation and  the  last  mile  connectivity    the  road  accident  victims  will  get  compensation expeditiously  a committee is being constituted in every district  this committee is being entrusted with the responsibility of road safety with regard to that district  wherever there is an accidental spot or black spot in any municipal road national highway state highway and city roads rectification and repairing of the same may be ordered to the concerned authority  by the time our government completes its five year tenure we will be able to save the lives of at least 50 per cent people  we are constructing 23 km of road per day   this is  a record  however the day we are able to save the lives of 50 per cent people that will be our best achievement  this is our mission  the issue of road safety has been taken very seriously by the government    members  are  welcome  to  give  suggestions  anytime  and  if  we  feel that  the  suggestions  are  worth  implementing  then  we  shall  definitely  implement them    i  would  like  to  assure  the  judiciary  that  this  government  is  very  much sensitive towards biofuel alternative fuel minimizing pollution  modifications in automobiles safety and road engineering sectors but the government need time to make decisions in this regard  government has to take decision with an integrated approach keeping in view the interests of all the stakeholders  lastly government is going to  make euro6 emission norms  mandatory from 1st april 2020 to curb the pollution  i have a firm belief that this bill will safeguard the nations interest and  will  be  helpful  in  saving  the  lives  of  people  and  it  will  also  bring  a  major change in this sector
