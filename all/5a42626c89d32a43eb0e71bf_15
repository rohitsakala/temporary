    by  making  this  legislation  we are  making  a  very  effective  and  welcome  move    if  this  bill  is  passed  and  then implemented properly in a timebound manner it goes without saying that that will revolutionize the transport sector  it is a safe cost effective and an environmental friendly mode of transport  there are anxieties to be addressed in this bill  water level  and  the  sustainability  are  in  a  dangerous  position    even  rivers  are disappearing    we  have  to  be  very  careful  in  handling  this  kind  of  situation  another  anxiety  is  about  the  formalities  in  getting  permission    i  hope  the government  would  constitute  an  exclusive  cell  for  this  purpose    the  subject water is in the concurrent list  hence the ministry should take the views of the state government into consideration  the issue of low lying bridges and structures in the rivers is also an important issue and the same may be addressed
