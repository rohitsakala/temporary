  this bill discusses the future of indias  most  prestigious  science  and  technology  institutions    i  am  sure  that  after the  smooth  passage  of  the  bill  in  both  lok  sabha  and  rajya  sabha  the  families and  students  of  tirupati  palakkad  goa  dharwad  bhilai  and  jammu  will  see  a long pending dream of theirs come true  actually when we are talking about iits it is not simply about having these institutes in different parts of the country   we are in fact talking about india  in todays world if there is one country and one society which puts the ultimate priority and emphasis on education it is that of our country  india    today  when  we  talk  about  the  parliament  as  a  temple  of democracy  then  surely  our  iits  are  the  temples  of  science  and  technology  therefore  i  am  proud  of  the  service  that  our  iits  have  rendered  over  the  last couple  of  decades    the  iits  in  the  beginning  were  set  up  through  foreign collaboration  and  international  aid    but  the  first  iit  which  was  indigenously developed  by  indian  academicians  without  any  foreign  collaboration  i  am  very proud to say is iit guwahati in the state of assam  similarly if we really want to ensure that india is not behind the world in terms of technology but it is leading the world in terms of technology then we must focus on our iits and try to see how we can support them  in this case in 2010 the anil kakodkar committee was set up    this  committee  outlined  a  target  a  very  ambitious  target  i  must  say  that every iit institute should have a faculty of 1200 professors and should have close to 12000 students  where do we stand now  apart from that we have to focus on research infrastructure  we can imagine that iits have special  laboratories which collaborate with state governments or district administrations on projects which are  relevant  to  that  state   again the  iit  was  set  up  under  an act  of  parliament  let us give it the respect that it deserves  we should give autonomy  we need our iits to be given the maximum support  but i feel that our students are not getting the support that they need  their fees was initially rs 2 lakh to rs 25 lakh  but this government wants to now increase the fees to rs 4 lakh  we demand that the fees  should  not  be  increased      i  agree  that  this  bill  is  good  but  yet  we  need  a greater public debate on our temples of science and education the focus must be on creating research projects and research parks i hope that this debate will lead to setting  up  of  another  research  park  in  guwahati  iit  my  request  to  the  hon minister is to create a research park with a startup capital of rs 50 crore let us talk about iits with a perspective of future i hope that this debate will talk about our future roadmap for our temples of science and education
