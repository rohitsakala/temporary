 when a uniform tax regime is going to come  into  effect  from  1st  july 2017 the  indirect  taxation  proposals  do  not  have any  significance  in  this  finance  bill  because  the  indirect  taxation  proposals  are coming in the gst bill in the near future  therefore i am directly coming to the income tax proposals the only reservation which i would like to make in respect of income tax is instead of giving rate of tax those who are having an income of more  than  rs50  lakh  you  are  imposing  a  surcharge  and  you  are  not  imposing  a rate  of  tax    the  entire  purpose  is  to  avoid  the  sharing  of  central  taxes  with  the state  tax  for  which  i  raise  my  objection  that  has  to  be  reviewed  because  the surcharge and cess will not come within the purview of the divisible pool  that are means the states are only getting 35 per cent of the gross tax revenue of the centre and  instead  of  42  per  cent  that  has  to  be  corrected    my  second  point  is  with regard to the customs duty  in the last years budget you have imposed five per cent customs duty on imported raw cashew nuts  after imposing five per cent of customs  duty  on  raw  cashew  nut  and  special  additional  duty  plus  cess  it  will come to around 936 per cent  therefore i demand to the government to withdraw the  five  per  cent  of  customs  duty  on  raw  cashew  nuts    regarding  the  customs duty of titanium dioxide pigment in order to protect the indigenous production and the indigenous industry i demand to the government to enhance the customs duty from 10 per cent to 20 per cent  coming to another point and that is with regard to frbm review and debt gdp ratio  the states revenue has declined like anything because of the demonetization the existing debt gdp ratio is 2027 per cent  the debt gdp ratio has to be increased with regard to demonetization i demand that a white paper be issued in respect of the demonetization process as a whole  coming to  the  last  point  regarding  the  transparency  in  the  political  funding  also    i  urge upon the chair and also the speaker to have a special session to discuss about the electoral reforms to be implemented in our country
