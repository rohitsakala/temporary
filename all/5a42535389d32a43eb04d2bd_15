  the  recent  price  rise  in  the  essential commodities  is  of  very  serious  concern  as  it  is  hurting  the  common  man  this  is mainly because there is no supportive government policy which could have helped to  raise  the  pulses  production  by  giving  more  incentives  to  the  farmers  growing onions tomatoes and pulses another major reason for the prevailing high prices is the policy of the government is not passing on the benefits of reduced crude prices to  the  ultimate  consumers  whenever  there  is  increase  in  crude  oil  prices  at  the global level the retail prices of petrol and diesel are automatically raised however when there is fall in global oil prices the entire benefit is not passed on resulting in high petrol and diesel prices another reason for increase of prices is the rise in the cost of inputs like seeds fertilisers pesticides and labour costs because of this the farmers  are  at  losing  end  and  many  of  them  unable  to  survive  are  migrating  to urban  areas  in  search  of  livelihood  i  represent  a  constituency  which  is  a  major producer  to  tomatoes  and  onions  in  any  given  year  the  lows  and  highs  of  these products are more than 10 fold the price to tomatoes vary from rs 2 per kg to rs 60 per kg i have personally seen and consoled the families when the farmers have thrown  their  produce  on  the  road  as  the  price  does  not  even  cover  the transportation  costs  the  main  beneficiaries  of  this  would  be  the  speculators hoarders middlemen and the  farmer  is  the  victim  if  proper  storage  facilities  are developed  the  price  can  be  maintained  at  the  a  reasonable  level  benefitting  the farmer and the consumer rising prices encourage hoarding blackmarketing and corruption  there  is  no  minimum  support  price  mechanism  because  of  this farmers are switching over the cash crops because of better return and lower risk the  measures  include  improving  our  farm  infrastructure  like  setting  up  of warehouses coldstorage units etc i also strongly recommend that support prices can  be  announced  for  farm  produce  like  dal  onions  and  tomatoes  stern  action shall  be  taken  against  hoarders  and  middle  men  proper  marketing  facilities  shall be developed which will ensure removal of middle man
