  the  bill  is  on  the  lines  of  the  beijing protocol  and  we  welcome  this  move    the  bill  is  laying  more  emphasis  on punishing  culprits  and  not  on  prevention  of  crime    notwithstanding  having  a number of security mechanisms in place we fail to  stop the ic 814 incident  so i strongly feel that instead of dealing with hijackers and hijack the government has to  lay  emphasis  on  preventing  hijacking  itself    moreover  i  would  like  to  know from the hon minister as to what prevented him from including a provision in the bill to shoot down aircraft if it becomes missile heading towards strategic targets or  civilian  pockets  or  other important  destinations   finally  providing compensation to all the victims without any discrimination has to be given priority
