 there is a huge spurt in urban population in india and hence this growth of urbanisation needs to be complimented by growth in urban  infrastructure  and  delivery  capabilities    although  the  rural  poverty  is reducing  at  a  faster  rate  than  the  poverty  in  the  urban  areas  due  to  mnrega  and other  poverty  alleviation  programmes  in  the  rural  areas    housing  for  all  by  2022 project  of  the  union  government  is  an  ambitious  project    but  it  is  yet  to  take  off because  it  needs  greater  coordination  from  the  states  and  also  support  from  the bankers  in our state of andhra pradesh a dwelling unit costs around rs 48 lakhs  so i would request the government to increase the subsidy component  similarly selection of beneficiaries is also a very critical issue and hence i would request the hon minister to give a larger say for the mps to participate in the selection process and for execution of this project
