  nabard  is  aimed  at  rural development  with  special  focus  on  agriculture  small  scale  cottage  and  village industries    today  nabard  has  become  the  lifeline  of  rural  economy  as  it  is actively  engaged in  supporting  farmers  rural infrastructure  development programmes empowerment of selfhelp groups etc  nabard has been playing a major role in ensuring the agricultural growth in our country  agricultural growth in  the  country  during  the  period  of  the  upa  was  43  per  cent    however  it  has declined  to  27  per  cent    therefore  it  is  high  time  that  government  initiated comprehensive measures to revive the agriculture sector in the country  therefore the discussion on this  bill is important  for  the  revival of  agriculture  sector  in  the country  however i am afraid that the proposed amendments seek to change the focus  of  nabard  from  the  agricultural  and  rural  sector  to  the  corporate  sector  the government by making this amendment is helping the large corporate groups to  get  loans  at  a  lower  interest  rate  the  reserve  bank  of  india  rbi  is  a shareholder and is the regulator of nabard  i am afraid that the governments move to free nabard from the control of rbi will eventually lead to functioning of  nabard  in  its  own  way  without  any  norms    therefore i  would  request  the government to kindly retain the control of rbi over nabard and send this bill to the parliamentary standing committee for a detailed study
