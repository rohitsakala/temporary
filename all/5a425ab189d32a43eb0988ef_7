  this  bill  proposes comprehensive  changes  in  the  benami  transaction  prohibition  act  1988    it expands  the  definition  of  benami  transactions  establishes  an  adjudicating authority  and  an  appellate  tribunal    it  also  increases  the  penalty  for  those indulging  in  benami  transactions    we  welcome  this  bill  why  the  benami transactions  are  so  prevalent  i  think  it  is  obvious  that  one  has  to  hide  wealth earned  from  undisclosed  sources  there  is  a  big  difference  between  the  actual value and the government official prices we do not have  good identification and valuation  of  properties  and  entities  so  by  this  act  alone  however  well  it  is implemented  i  do  not  think  we  can  eliminate  benami  transactions  we  need  a gamut of reforms and we need those that will eliminate these factors that will aid and  facilitate  benami  transactions  i  am  glad  the  finance  minister  and  the government  has  taken  into  cognizance  and  the  government  is  simultaneously taking  a  series  of  systematic  steps  and  reforms  we  have  to  distinguish  these benami  transactions  as  predicate  offences  and  benami  transactions  as  primary crimes i have submitted an amendment to this bill in benami transactions where it  is  predicate  offence  the  land  should  go  to  the  central  government  benami transactions where the state government land was illegally allocated to somebody to  favour  somebody  then  it  should  go  back  to  the  state  government  if  it  is  an income  tax  evasion  and  the  benami  transaction  is  caught  then  it  will  go  to  the central government if it is corruption at the central government then i think the land in the benami transaction should go back to the central government we also need  to  take  cognizance  of  the  standing  committee  report  saying  that  the investigation  by  the  initiating  officer  should  be  completed  within  a  specific  time frame  it  is  better  if  time  frame  is  mentioned  information  technology  has  some problem  when  applied  to  detecting  benami  transactions  land  identification  land valuation  and  location  codes  should  be  there  for  this  purpose  standardization  of information relating to land deeds is required
