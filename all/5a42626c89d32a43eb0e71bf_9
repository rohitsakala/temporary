  this  bill  is  not  only  a  historic  but  also  a revolutionary  one    but  we  need  to  observe  onetwo  caution  in  this  bill  because when  the  inland  waterways  would  get  operational  there  is  possibility  of  rivers being  polluted  due  to  plying  of  motorboats  which  would  use  oil    therefore  we need to make a provision in this bill that would prevent rivers from such pollution  i  also  request  the  hon  minister  to  include  the  narmada  canal  which  runs  from kewadiya colony in north gujarat upto saurashtra should  be under it  the mahi river  which  is  also  known  as  mahi  sagar  should  also  be  included  under  the national  waterway    gujarat  has  a  long  coastal  line  of  1600  km  and  that  should also  be  used  for  navigation  purposes    today  mumbai  is  facing  huge  traffic congestion  and  to  ease  this  congestion  sea  navigation    should  be  used  for passenger traffic
