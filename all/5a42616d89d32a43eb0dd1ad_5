  atomic  energy  is  not  only sustainable but it is also very safe energy    we are an energy deficit nation and we cannot  afford  not  to  have  nuclear  energy    we  welcome  this  bill  and  we  support this bill  the amendment of section 2 of the 1962 act states that the 51 per cent paid up share capital of the power plant can be held by one or  more government agencies  i seek some clarifications and put some questions also  within this 51 per cent all the 51 per cent or how much can the psus own or how much can the central government own directly  that is one question  secondly since we are privatising  the  psus  can  the  private  companies  invest  in  the  psus  can  foreign investment  in  the  psus  be  limited  to  49  per  cent    or  does  it  mean  that  we  are limiting  foreign  and private investment  to  49 per  cent  or  is it  49 per  cent direct investment  or  49  per  cent  of  51  per  cent  indirect  investment  taking  the  overall private or  foreign investment  to 73  per  cent    so that  is something on  which  we need clarification from the ministry  we need to facilitate even foreign investment but definitely we should not facilitate foreign influence  while our scientists are promoting  thorium  capacity  for  rd  we  feel  we  are  being  slowly  nudged  to uranium  based  ones    it  baffles  me  why  we  are  buying  uranium  from  australia belarus and so many other countries  it also assumes significance in the backdrop of  our  make  in  india  campaign    telangana  and  andhra  pradesh  both  stand  to gain particularly telangana  i say this because 50 per cent of the uranium in this country  is  in  two  districts    nalgonda  and  cuddapah  in  andhra  pradesh  and  of course some in guntur  i want to have one important clarification from the hon minister as to whether it is 49 per cent direct investment  i do not think any psu in the recent future will sell 49 per cent of  the stake
