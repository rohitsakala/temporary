  i  would  like  to  say  that  the  child  labour amendment  bill  2016  is  very  important    i  think  india  is  probably  one  of  the fastest growing economies in the world a powerful nation but at the other side of the pendulum we are still struggling with child labour  the government needs to bring  convergence  to  the  definition  of  adolescence  because  different  acts  have different definition for it   there is a need to take stringent measures to check child trafficking    i  think  it  is  a very  complex  issue  so  we  should  not  rush  into  pass  it  let there be no attempt at diluting the definitions of family and hazardous  there should be one age block for rte act juvenile justice act and child labour act  every child deserves a good quality education and right of dignity in labour
