 i rise to speak in support of this  bill  which  has  been  brought  in  the  interest  of  the  common  men    it  is  well known  that  the  consumer  was  exploited  in  the  real  estate  sector    builders  take advance  on  the  promise  of  constructing  flats    earlier  lands  were  bought  from farmers at a pittance  the project for which lands were acquired were not started and there were talks of starting other projects  the farmers were not paid in full  registrations  were  fake  there  were  no  documents  and  such  types  of  frauds  were committed    this  bill  has  good  provisions  to  put  a  stop  to  such  frauds    it  is  my belief that this bill will strengthen the monitoring system
