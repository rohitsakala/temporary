  this  mental health care bill 2016 has made a special provision for all those people who are suffering with mental illness and are wandering on the streets  this bill makes a provision  that  the  police  officer  who  is  the  incharge  of  the  police  station  in whose  area  people  are  wandering  at  a  large  scale  can  take  them  under  his protection and those will be subject to examination by a medical officer  if their residences  are  known  those  people  will  be  taken  to  their  residences    if  their residences  are  not  known  those  people  will  be  taken  to  establishments  for homeless  persons    i  would  like  to  know  from  the  hon  minister  if  he  can  throw some  light  on  vocational  rehabilitation  because  vocational  rehabilitation  has  not been  mentioned  in  the  bill    this  bill  is  very  good  in  the  sense  it  has  covered almost  all  the  aspects  of  a  person  suffering  from  mental  illness    talking  about human  resources  number  of  psychiatrists  in  the  country  as  of  today  is  around 4500    today  in  our  country  we  require  around  12500  psychiatrists    the number  of  psychiatric  nurses  today  is  04  nurses  per  one  lakh  which  is  around 3000    the  number  that  we  require  today  is  around  56000  paramedical personnel    so  i  urge  upon  the  government  that  these  numbers  should  also  be taken  into  consideration  for  effective  implementation  of  this  mental  healthcare bill  medical council of india is the registering body for doctors  for nurses we have  nursing  council    but  for  other  paramedical  staff  there  is  no  designated council  there can be legal issues coming up when the treatment is going on like say  the  paramedical  staff  is  not  registered  under  any  council    so  i  think  we should consider about those councils as well  research is the very important part as far as mental healthcare is concerned  in this the consent of the patient should be  taken  before  doing  any  kind  of  research  on  that  person    so  proper  consent should be taken from the concerned authority if the person is not in a position to give  his  own  consent    another  very  good  provision  in  the  bill  which  is  very much  appreciable  is  inclusion  of  ayush    ayurveda  yoga  and  naturopathy unani  siddha  and  homoeopathy    it  is  appreciable  that  the  national  mental health policy has been announced by hon minister and also keeping in mind that there is shortage of doctors in the country he has provided funding for almost 15 centres  of  excellence  and  35  pg  training  departments    the  district  mental health programme has also been extended to 118 districts in the 12th fiveyear plan in addition to the 123 districts which was initially included in the 11th fiveyear plan  the funds have been almost doubled  the hon minister in his speech mentioned  about  mentallyill  mothers  can  keep their  children with  them   this  is one of my concerns that in some cases like bipolar diseases or schizophrenia it is not advisable that the child should be kept with the mother  so my request is that such cases should be referred to the mental health board which will take a call on whether the children should be kept with the mentallyill mothers or not  lastly i would like to specially thank the hon minister for making a provision in the bill of punishing those people who will not follow the law     dr ratna de nag the bill seeks to protect promote and improve the  rights  of  the  patients  in  need  of  mental  healthcare    as  per  national  crime records  bureau  131666  people  committed  suicide  in  india  in  2014    people commit suicide due to lack of funding lack of human resources and social stigma associated with mental illness  there is a massive shortage of psychiatrists in the public sector  there are some good provisions in the bill also  the provision of appointing  a  nominee  may  lead  to  damaging  the  goodwill  and  bonding  between the  families    furthermore  a  mental  patient  can  only  be  admitted  to  a  mental institution after being reviewed by the mental health review commission  this may  lead  to  undue  delay  in  the  treatment  and  make  the  entire  process  more complicated    the  bill  states  about  electroconvulsive  therapy  ect  in  case  of mental illness of minors  due to serious hazards of electroconvulsive therapy on minors and its controversial practice in the treatment of mental illness in minors a  blanket  ban  on  ect  for  minors  should  be  implemented  as  advised  by  the  world health  organization    the  bill  states  that  medical  records  can  be  accessed  by patients unless it results in causing serious mental harm to the patient  there is no definition  of  what  would  constitute  as  serious  mental  harm  it  is  left  to  the psychiatrists decision  the bill must provide for stringent punishment in cases of falsifying the medical records  the communitybased rehabilitation establishment and  services  for  patients  has  not  been  defined    we  request  the  hon  minister  to include dementia under mental healthcare bill to incorporate one neurologist in the board and the admission and discharge of a mental patient in a mental health insitution  should  be  done  under  the  jurisdiction  of  a  physician    regular  mental health awareness camps should be arranged by the government organizations and nongovernment  organizations  and  to  review  and  assess  that  programme  by  an expert and finally assess analyse the benefit of the programme and the response of the people
