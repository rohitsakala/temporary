  i welcome this bill on behalf of my party  this  is  really  a  good  step    there  are  so  many  cases  pending  in  courts    this  is really a cause of concern for the common man  this is the reason as to why most of the people do not want to go to the courts and get their issues resolved outside the courts  the setting up of commercial courts would certainly give some relief to the  people  but  we  will  have  to  appoint  suitable  judges  for  the  purpose  and  they should also be provided training in micro economics  all the judgements of these courts should come  within a stipulated time frame   the government should also think as to how dispose of such a large number of cases pending in our courts  if the government is really interested to set up commercial courts they should first think as to how to make them attractive for people so that people go there and get justice  though setting up commercial courts is really good and we welcome that really  we  should  think  how  trained  judges  could  be  appointed  in  commercial courts  and  appellate  divisions  of  the  high  courts  so  that  speedy  justice  is  given  what  we  need  more today  is that people should get speedy  justice   i  would  also like  to  know  from  the  hon  minister  as  to  what  they  have  thought  of  appointing judges in these courts
