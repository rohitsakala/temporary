  with  regard  to  the imposition of the compensation cess to protect the domestic products against the imported  ones  i  could  not  understand  the  logic    of  course  there  is  a  need  to protect  the  local  manufacturers    at  the  same  time  we  should  encourage competition  amongst  the  manufacturers    therefore  the  compensation  cess  may not  be  relevant  in  the  present  day  competitive  marketing    secondly  it  removes several cesses and surcharges and makes the taxation system quite simple  it is a welcome  feature    as  regards  the  abolition  of  cess  on  water  it  will  definitely hamper the local panchayats as they are running short of sources of revenues  so it needs to be reconsidered  perhaps if the csr is implemented with a lot of faith and  zeal  this  gap  between  the  urban  areas  and  rural  areas  can  be  reduced  similarly  we  now  that  the  entire  state  wealth  has  been  concentrated  in  one  per cent of the people  so the tax reforms should also focus on how to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor and the rural areas and the urban areas  secondly every  time  we  harp  on  infrastructure    but  there  is  no  focus  on  building  ruralinfrastructure  so it is high time that the government focuses on rural areas rather than on urban areas  there are a lot of loopholes in the system  so the loopholes should be plugged so that we can collect more taxes which would be beneficial to the people
