  we  know  that  there  are  some heinous  crime  cases  like  nirbhaya    it  is  also  partly  true  that  crimes  being committed  by  children  in  the  age  group  of  16  to  18  years  are  increasing  and  to combat  this  situation  the  new  bill  is  being  introduced  though  there  are  some differing  views  within  the  cabinet  within  the  standing  committee  and  among experts and social activists  before making such a major sensitive change in this act we  must think why crimes being committed by juveniles are increasing  as per  the  report  of  the  national  crime  records  bureau  2011  the  crimes  against children  reported  a  24  per  cent  increase  when  compared  with  2010  figures  everybody  knows  about  cruelty  to  child  labour    due  to  poverty  children  are working  very  hard  like  adults  in  brickkilns  small  industries  shops  and  in agriculture sector these are also crimes against children there are some laws to prevent  such  crimes  but  where  is  the  implementation  of  such  laws  to  save  the children  of  the  juveniles    the  net  result  is  that  juveniles  are  acting  like  adults  now  we  are  going  to  introduce  harder  laws  than  before    this  bill  will  possibly violate  articles  14  21  and  20  1  of  the  constitution    the  provision  of  juveniles between the ages of 16 and 18 to be tried as an adult is not in accordance with the united nations convention on the rights of child  a solution to the problem has to be thought of within the parameters of the juvenile justice act itself and this can be  done  by  strengthening  the  institutions  under  the  act  and  by  ensuring  that  a juvenile  who  has  committed  such  a  crime  is  not  allowed  to  repeat  the  offence andor intimidate the victim again  one immediate amendment that can be moved is  to  remove  the  upper  limit  of  3  years  for  detention  under  the  present  act  to  a suitable  period  agreed  upon  by  all  concerned  persons    thus  the  amendment suggested  in  the  juvenile  justice  bill  2014  is  shortsighted  and  unjust  and  against all tenets of human rights  it will not lead to either public safety or improvement in juvenile  behaviour    to  achieve  this  the  juvenile  justice  act  should  be strengthened    special  consultation  with  the  eminent  psychologist  and  social activists is much needed first save the childhood of the juveniles and then punish if necessary
