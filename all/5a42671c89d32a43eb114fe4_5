  if  india  has  to  become  a  global  economic superpower standards are an extremely important subject and we cannot become a global economic superpower without passing such type of bills  the bill proposes to widen the scope and bring in more products and services under standards regime and end the inspector raj  mandatory certification regime of an article process or service  is  necessary  from  the  point  of  view  of  health  safety  environment prevention  of  deceptive  practices  security  etc    the  other  positive  aspect  of  this bill  is  that  it  allows  foreign  and  indian  entities  other  than  the  bureau  to  be recognized as the standardizing authority  i suggest that bis should be allowed to primarily  focus  only  on  certification  and  standardization    the  terms  used  in  the bill  may  also  be  defined  as  accepted  internationally    clause  7  of  the  bill  deals with  the  appointment  of  director  general    bis  is  a  fully  autonomous  body  not financed  by  the  central  government    clause  73  indicates  that  the  central government will appoint director general which is not advisable  bis should be headed  by  a  scientist    how  can  bis  accredit  other  similar  bodies    the  bill  is  a consumerfriendly and helps in stopping unfair and unscrupulous trade practices  i have  seen  in  the  country  where  various  manufacturers  are  making  certain  claims about products and services that do not hold true  the bill proposes to give more autonomy to the bis  it is a welcome step  you  are only talking about technical committee which is nonexistent in the present set up of bis so i would request the hon minister to clarify this  with the proposed bill i am confident that india will catchup with the world standards and fulfill the hon prime ministers slogan of zero defect zero effect
