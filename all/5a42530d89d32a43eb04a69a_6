  the  ministry  has  been  allocated  rs51026 crore  in  201718    between  200708  and  201718  the  expenditure  of  the department  increased  at  an  average  rate  of  183  per  cent  annually    however expenditure  on  the  department  as  a  proportion  of  total  budget  expenditures remained  in  the  same  range  increasing  from  11  per  cent  to  19  over  this  period which is a matter of concern  a major area of concern remains the underutilization of  budgeted  funds    if  we  look  at  the  capitalrevenue  expenditure  breakup  i notice that 998 per cent of the departments expenditure is estimated to be spent on  revenue  expenses  such  as  such  as  subsidies  on  premiums  and  interest  rates among  other  things    the  coverage  of  the  pradhan  mantri  fasal  bima  yojana  is proposed to be increased from 30 per cent of all farmers in 201617 to 40 per cent in  201718  and  50  per  cent  in  201819    i  hope  these  targets  are  met  and eventually we move towards a 100 per cent insurance coverage to all farmers  the ministry  must  focus  on  giving  much  more  visibility  to  the  schemes  to  that  they effectively reach the intended beneficiaries the farmer  it is also essential that we move away from flood irrigation to the drip or sprinkle irrigation system  the long term  irrigation  fund  has  been  provided  with  an  additional  rs20000  crore  in  this year  my humble suggestion to the hon minister would be that the targets for the utilization  of  these  enormous  sums  of  money  must  be  clear  concise    in  each districts  of  newly  formed  telengana  there  must  be  a  proportionate  increase  in krishi  vigyan  kendras  kvks    i  request  the  hon  minister  to  incorporate  the creation of these additional kvks in telangana
