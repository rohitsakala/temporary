  i  think  it  is  the  first  time  in  the  country  that educational  institutions  are  coming  up  in  public  private  partnership  through legislation  through this bill we are now going to empower these institutes to grant degrees  so  that  the  degrees  can  be  accepted  through  a  statute    i  think  it  would  be better if private partners get a levelplaying field in making decisions  i am happy to note  that  the  reservation  system  will  be  implemented  in  these  institutions    i  am happy to see from the bill that the government is going to give scholarships and also going  to  fund  the  institutes  for  the  benefit  of  economically  backward  students  and also  meritorious  students    but  i  would  like  to  know  whether  funding  by  the government is limited only to five years  i hope that the government will permit us to submit our proposal and sanction one institute to the state of telangana  we need one institute under this new act for our new state of telangana in my constituency karimnagar
