  a  proposal  was  passed  on  7  december 2010 by the union cabinet announcing 20 iiits to be started under the publicprivate partnership but only 15 iiits started functioning out of them  but these institutes are not empowered to grant degrees  a provision to this effect has been made in this bill for which i congratulate the hon minister  i would request that one iiit should also be set up in kolhapur  kolhapur is also an industrial hub as many big companies like the kirlosker raymonds are based there  if we open such an institute there it would create job opportunity for 2025 thousand people
