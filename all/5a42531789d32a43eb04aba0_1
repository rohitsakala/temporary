  even  seventy  years  after  independence  the organization of our national defence the removal of poverty and the provision of education  for  the  indian  masses  continue  to  demand  our  urgent  attention  the challenge  for  any  finance  minister  is  to  strike  just  the  right  balance  between  the imperative of defence and the need for development in allocating resources of the state  viewed in this light the finance minister has provided a reasonable sum of rs274114  crore  for  defence  expenditure  excluding  pensions  there  have  been steady moderate increases in spending on defence during the last three years the current ratio of defence expenditure to gdp is 214 per cent which is higher than the  cap  of  176  per  cent  that  had  been  proposed  by  the  thirteenth  finance commission   in fact the overall modernization budget has gone down this year  i am  especially  dismayed  by  the  cut  in  the  navys  modernization  budget  the protection  of  the  sealanes  traversing  the  arabian  sea  and  the  bay  of  bengal  is essential if we are to secure our economic future as part of an asian resurgence in the  21st century     the  strong  case  for increasing  capital  expenditure on  the  latest military  equipment  is  unfortunately  undermined  by  the  sorry  record  of  underutilization by the ministry of defence of allotted funds  it is most unfortunate that the ministry of defence returned more than rs12000 crore under the capital head in 201516 and about rs7000 crore in 201617  i hope that necessary steps will be taken to make the defence ministry more efficient in utilizing capital funds  it is  a  matter  of  grave  concern  that  even  seven  decades  after  independence  our defence  requirements  are  heavily  reliant  on  imports    i  would  like  to  ask  the finance minister why in the budget any special incentives have not been given to defence  production within  india  in support  of  the prime  ministers  make  in  india programme  our political leadership must do their best not to impose impossible internal security tasks on our military so that our soldiers can focus on defending our borders  at the same i urge the prime minister to give our country a full time defence  minister  who  deems  the  proud  responsibility  of  organizing  our  national defence to be more important than power at any cost in a small state of our great indian  union    in  order  to  build  a  new  india  by  the  75th  anniversary  of  our independence we will have to integrate our defence policy with a grand strategic vision based on a broad and imaginative definition of genuine national security
