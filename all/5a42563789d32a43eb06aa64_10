 i think that juveniles need reforms and not  prisons  as  has  been  propagated  or  brought  in  the  bill    i  would  like  to  touch upon  this  bill  from  two  perspective    psychological  and  the  medical  perspectives  there are several studies where it is mentioned that a child of 16 years of age is not capable of comprehending a situation as to what is good or bad for him  it is very much  physiological  and  anatomically  the  child  is  not  developed  enough  to  make any judgment for himself to take rational decisions  reducing the age from 18 to 16  years  is  doing  gross  injustice  to  juvenile  population    it  is  also  against  our commitment to un convention on child rights  i oppose this bill very strongly  the discussion was not concluded
