  there is no basis of these objections  this is in the national  interest  that  we  had  to  withdraw  this  bill  which  was  there  earlier    this same  bill  was  passed  in  rajya  sabha  in  2013    but  because  the  lok  sabha  was dissolved in 2014 the bill could not be passed in lok sabha  that is why we have come out with a new bill  as far as promulgation of an ordinance is concerned since the hon prime minister had made a commitment on behalf of the country it is  our  duty  to  ensure  that  the  commitment  is  completely  followed  upon    that  is why there is no basis and proper reason for objecting to this bill the bill was introduced
