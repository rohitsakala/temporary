 i express my disappointment on bill because we were hoping that the amendments which would be brought in this bill would make the law stronger and protect our children from entering into the  child  labour  system    but  instead  it  actually  reverses  the  wheel    the  bill  is also in contrast to the spirit of the right to education act  the expectation of the people does not seem to be meeting at all through this bill  the fundamental issue is  the  family  enterprise  issue    in  the  name  of  this  provision  child  trafficking  is going  to  increase    this  bill  disappoints  us  further  by  not  even  mentioning hazardous occupations in which adolescence labourers will not be allowed to work  another  important  aspect  is  that  we  want the  work  environment  to  be  safe clean and condition but nothing is spoken about that in this bill  no specific regulations have been given for the work place  this bill ultimately will bring all the female children into the child labour system  this runs in contrast to the slogan of beti bachao  beti  padhao  given  by  the  government    i  would  like  to  say  that  the exception that the bill creates about the children under the age of 14 should all be completely removed  children of this country deserve to go to school and not to work
