 first of all i would like to start with the problems of andhra pradesh  however the government has shown full  commitment  and  support  to  the  state  of  andhra  pradesh    and  there  will  be 100  per  cent  funding  for  the  polavaram  project    there  will  also  be  special assistance measure for andhra pradesh by way of repayment of loan and interest of externally  added  projects  signed  between  201516  to  201920    according  to  the special package andhra pradesh will get the benefit of this 30 per cent  but what i  want  to  bring  to  the  notice  of  the  central  government  is  that  according  to  the special  status  certain  benefit  is  also  supposed  to  be  in  the  ratio  of  9010    in  the budget  the  government  granted  capital  gains  tax  exemption  to  the  farmers  for  a period of two years  we request that the capital gains tax exemption be granted for the first sale without any time limit  there is another issue which is regarding the frbm  limit  for  the  state  of  andhra  pradesh    the  frbm  limit  for  the  state  of andhra pradesh therefore has to be enhanced to 35 per cent  it is a long pending request  coming to demonetisation we are now promoting cashless economy and digital  economy    but  maximum  benefit  is  accruing  to  the  banks  rather  than  the common man  the transaction charges which are being levied by the banks have to be curtailed  according to gst there is one constraint from the state of andhra pradesh which is the off shore oil and gas reserves  we want that even where the oil  and  gas  reserves  are  sitting  off  shore  royalty  should  be  paid  to  the  landing states also  i would also request to look after our demand and fulfil the request of building a world class capital in the state of andhra pradesh  with regard to tax incentives we request that other than the seven districts out of the 13 districts the district of prakasham also be added to the list of backward districts  i would also like to  raise two important  issues  we  should  give  the  confidence to the  farmers saying  that  this  house  is  committed  to  their  benefits    so  there  should  be agriculture  budget  every  year  separately    central  government  need  to  take certain measures so that nris prefer india come back and help in the growth and development of this country
