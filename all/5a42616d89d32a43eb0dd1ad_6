  this  bill  allows  the  formation  of  joint  ventures between  the  nuclear  power  corporation  and  other  government  companies    we insist  that  nuclear  industry  should  continue  to  remain  in  the  domain  of  the government  and  there  should  not  be  entry  of  private  capital  and  fdi  into  this sector that will compromise our  national interest  i would like to make it clear that we are not opposed to nuclear energy    compared to 1997 when the kyoto protocol was signed in 2014 both wind and solar power exceeded power added by nuclear  sources    all  these  are  clear  indications  of  nuclear  energy  becoming  a much  lesser  source  of  energy  throughout  the  world    this  was  the  experience  of japan france germany spain uk and  even the  united states   so we should not turn a blind eye towards this global experience of shifting from nuclear sources to  other  sources    in  such  circumstances  the  government  of  india  is  investing heavily on nuclear energy and want to promote nuclear energy as a major source of our energy  that is a flawed policy  we should explore other sources especially in a country like india where untapped hydro potential is enormous  so we should explore such untapped hydro potential more
