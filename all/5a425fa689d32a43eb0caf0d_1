  this  historic  bill  like  many other  important  bills  was  originally  brought  by  the  upa  government    at  that time like those  bills  and  aadhar this  bill  was  also  opposed  by  the  members now in treasury benches  some crucial provisions of the original bill have been omitted by the nda government  that is why there is a demand from the rajya sabha for referring it to the select committee  to build a home is the dream of the people especially the poor people  we know that there are a lot of faulty practices and  cheating  in  real  estate  sector  so  i  welcome  this  bill    the  bill  says  that  all states and union territories must establish state level regulatory authorities  the bill also proposes to constitute real estate appellate tribunal  the tribunal may also  refer  the  case to  the  competition  commission   a  central  advisory  council consisting  of  representatives  from  the  union  ministry  state  governments representatives of the real estate regulatory authorities consumers and labourers will be established to advise the central government on major questions of policy and protection of consumer interest  one of the important provisions in this bill is that 70 per  cent of the  amount  collected  from  the buyers should be used  only  for construction    then  the  bill  requires  that  all  residential  projects  with  some exception  be  registered    registration  is  not  required  for  projects  which  are  less than  500  sq  meters  or  entail  the  construction  of  less  than  eight  apartments    i would  suggest  that  requirement  of  registration  should  be  avoided  and  the  rajya sabha select committee have also given that suggestion to you  real estate agents must  also  register  themselves    there  are  certain  inconsistencies  in  the  bill  several states have already enacted or are in the process of enacting laws that have provisions  that  are  inconsistent  with  the  bill    according  to  the  provisions  of  the bill  the  penalty  for  the  consumer  is  higher  and  the  penalty  for  the  developer  is less developers have to pay only two or three per cent in case of default but the consumers pay 16 to 18 per cent of interest for their default  this is also against the suggestion made by the select committee  it should be rectified  i appreciate the ministers wisdom that he has provided that 70 per cent of the amount collected from  the  buyer  should  be  deposited  in  a  separate  account    there  is  provision  of even  imprisonment  for  the  realtors  if  they  fail  to  abide  by  the  orders  by  the appellate tribunal  the term allottee should be redefined to include the person agreed to be sold  the bill has already been delayed  now we all expect its early passage
