 through you i would like to submit few points before the  government   some  of  our  colleagues  have  expressed their apprehensions about this bill and i would like to clarify in this regard that this bill proposes to make certain amendments in few acts and to repeal certain enactments which  are  consequential  to  the  enactments  proposed  to  be  enacted  for  the introduction  of  goods  and  services  tax    it  does  not  involve  any  financial implication    so  there  is  no  need  to  worry  about    in  the  coming  years  this  will prove to be the largest economic reform in the country  i would also like to submit that there should be no objection about the penalty provisions for not providing the required  information    it  should  be  our  moral  and  constitutional  responsibility  to provide information which has been asked to provide under the provisions of this act
