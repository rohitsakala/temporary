 there has been no increase in the total percentage of reservation for scheduled castes  so inclusion of more castes in the list would be a burden on the castes which are already in the list  in the budget it has  been  stated  that  the  sc  and  st  communities  will  be  given  reservation  and facilities but only a meager fund has been allocated for this purpose in the budget  so how come their development can be ensured  the sc st subplan has been removed in the budget  implementation of the schemes meant for them as well as achieving  the  targets  of  these  schemes  will  be  difficult  to  achieve  due  to  nonreceipt of adequate funds   i would like to draw the attention of the hon minister towards the outstanding amount of rs 12 thousand crore meant for the postmetric scholarship  of  last  year  for  the  scst  students    for  the  welfare  of  the  scs  and sts  there  should  be  legislation  to  the  effect  that  the  subplans  of  scs  and  sts should  be  made  mandatory  at  the  level of  central  and  state  governments  so  that we can take care of the welfare and ensure benefits to the sc and st communities  shri  charanjeet  singh  rori  dalits  are  being  discriminated against  all kinds of atrocities are being perpetrated on dalits in different states  i hail  from  haryana  and  90  per  cent  children  belonging  to  sc    st  communities                                                             original in punjabi studying in government schools hail from very poor families these students find themselves  at  the  receiving  end    no  teachers  are  there  in  government  schools  these  students  do  not  have  books    the  school  buildings  are  in  a  dilapidated condition  this  is  because  mostly  students  belonging  to  dalit  community  are studying  in  these  government  schools  so  these  schools  are  a  picture  of  neglect  untouchability  is  being  brazenly  practiced  in  these  schools    the  haryana government  must  ensure  that  this  government  schools  are  provided  all  facilities  besides  the  reserved  seats  are  not  being  filled    there  is  no  reservation  in promotion the  dalit  employees  are  being  victimized all these  issues  need  to  be looked into on priority basis
