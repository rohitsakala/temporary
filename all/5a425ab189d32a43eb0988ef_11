 the government will have to increase the staff strength in the income tax department to properly implement this act because they are under staffed presently  it will be easy to curb benami transactions through digitization because  it  would  lead  to  trace  such  transactions    the  deadline  for  declaring undisclosed  income  is  30th  september    this  will  help  in  registering  benami transactions  in  the  name  of  real  owner    moreover  people  have  to  pay  tax  at  the rate of 45 percent on such income this would significantly increase the revenue of the government  but this has to be taken care of that the immunity which is being given  should not  be violated  because  there  are  apprehensions  in  the  minds of  the people that the income tax department might reopen their cases in future  the hon finance  minister  should  pay  attention  to  this  fact  also    once  this  act  is operationalised  it  would  definitely  increase  revenue  to  the  exchequer  of  the government
