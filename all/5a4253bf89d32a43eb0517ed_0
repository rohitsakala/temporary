  the  rajya  sabha  passed  this  bill unanimously  yesterday    i  am  saying  this  because  it  sent  a  positive  message  to bangladesh  that  as  far  as  the  good  relations  between  india  and  bangladesh  are concerned  all  the  parties  in  india  are  united  and  there  is  no  question  of  any difference  therefore i am requesting all the members of this house to show the same  spirit  in  the  passage  of  this  bill  as  was  shown  by  rajya  sabha  yesterday  this  bill  has  got  a  long  history    with  the  partition  of  india  pakistan  came  into existence and todays bangladesh which was earlier called east pakistan was part of  pakistan    at  that  time  the  radcliffe  award  was  meant  to  demarcate  boundary between india and east pakistan but that award could not be implemented  in the year  1971  bangladesh  came  into  existence  as  a  new nation  and  i  need  not  repeat the  role  india  played  in  it    an  agreement  was  signed  in  1974  between  the  then prime minister late smt indira gandhi and bangbandhu sheikh mujibur rehman popularly  known  as  the  indiramujib  agreement    though  this    agreement  was ratified by  the  parliament  of  bangladesh  the  parliament  of  india  could not  ratify the same  and  no  discussion  took  place  on  this  matter  for  all  these  37  years   the ratification could not be done due to nondemarcation of land boundary then dr manmohan  singh took initiative  for the  same  in 2011   he visited  bangladesh in 2011 and a protocol was signed there  and this bill which i am presenting here is the logical conclusion of the 1974 agreement and the protocol signed in 2011 but initially  when  this  bill  was  introduced  in  the  rajya  sabha  it  was  vehemently opposed mainly by three parties ie the agp bjp and tmc  agp and bjp were of the view that the interests of assam were overlooked in that bill  the tmc on its part was of the view that the implementation of this bill would add burden on the exchequer of the state government as a large number of people would migrate to the state from bangladesh  therefore they would need a package for the state to meet the expenses to be incurred on this count  though this bill was referred to the standing committee that time the committee could not give its report as the committee  got  dissolved  with  the  dissolution  of  lok  sabha    when  our government  assumed  the  office  on  26  may  2014  i  chose  bangladesh  as  the  first country  for  my  visit  as  the  minister  of  external  affairs    when  i  met  the  prime minister  of  bangladesh  sheikh  hasina  she  strongly  urged  me  that  the  protocol which  was  signed  by  dr  manmohan  singh  with  her  country  should  be  taken forward    i  talked  to  our  prime  minister  on  the  matter  and  he  told  me  that  try  to resolve the unresolved issues and go ahead  first of all we talked to mamata ji on this matter and we were given to know that she wanted a package for the state and 23 rounds of talks were held with her  she demanded a sum of rs 3008 crore as package  when the assessment was done as to how many people would migrate to the state from bangladesh one assessment showed the figure as 3500 and the other assessment  showed  it  as  35000    so  we  decided  the  package  based  on  the  latter and  also  said  that  it  would  be  variable    when  the  new  standing  committee  was formed  on  1st  september  2014  we  referred  the  bill  to  the  committee  on  16th september  so far as assam is concerned the chief minister of the state echoing our sentiments said that we would not give even an inch of land and the land which is in possession of bangladesh should be taken back  then we thought that assam should be left out of the discussions and wanted to get  passed the lba involving west  bengal  meghalaya  and  tripura  in  discussions  and  also  decided  to  renegotiate  with  assam  later  on    i  took  this  proposals  to  the  cabinet  and  it  was decided in the cabinet meeting that this bill should be passed leaving assam out  but later on when we talked to the leaders of all the parties it emerged that assam was also not objected to it but the congress party very categorically told us that if we  wanted  their  support  assam  should  also  be  included  in  it    now  we  had  two options  one  was  to  leave  the  lba  and  the  second  was  to  include  assam  and  go ahead  today i would like to say it would not have been wise to leave lba and therefore we decided to include assam also in order to get the lba passed as was presented in 2013  i talked  to prime minister on this matter and called a meeting of  the  cabinet  and  we  decided  to  leave  out  the  earlier  amendments  and  also decided to take everyone along us for the passage of this bill  this bill has been passed in the rajya sabha in the same form as it was presented in 2013 and i have brought in this  bill in  this  house  in the same  form   i  would  like to  say  that this bill  would  benefit  us  in  three  ways    firstly  the  demarcation  of  land  boundary which  is  yet  incomplete  would  get  completed    secondly  the  fate  of  the  people living in enclaves was hanging in balance and this issue would also get resolved  thirdly the parcels of land which are in  adverse occupation would also turn into adverse occupation  along with these three things we could also go ahead in the matters of trade and transit etc and we could also get closely connected with the northeast  at the same time our relations with bangladesh would souch the same height as were in 1971  it is a historic moment and after the passage of this bill the shape  the  agreement  would  take  after  41  years  would  be  the  outcome  of  100th constitutional  amendment    moreover  this  100th  constitutional  amendment would get itself registered in the history as well    shri adhir ranjan chowdhury the constitution amendment bill 2013 was introduced in the rajya sabha in december 2013  it was referred to the parliamentary standing committee  the indiabangladesh agreement was signed  in  1974  but  as  it  was  not  ratified  it  has  not  been  implemented  in  reality  the land boundary agreement is aimed to enhance bilateral cooperation between the two countries  this is a momentous legislation  three issues were outstanding between  bangladesh  and  india    one  is  the  undemarcated  land  boundary  of  61 kilometres  exchange  of  enclaves  and  adverse  possessions  remain  unsettled  the truth is that i am very much in agreement with the concern expressed by the chief minister west bengal because the radcliff line was drawn arbitrarily much to the disservice of the  neighbouring  and  adjoining  states of  bangladesh namely  west bengal meghalaya assam and tripura  therefore i would be in full support of the  rehabilitation  package  that  has  been  sought  by  the  west  bengal  government  not only that  i would also propose that rehabilitation should be proper and should be scientific  the indian citizens residing in indian enclaves in bangladesh have been  deprived  of  basic  necessities  and  rights  since  1950  they  deserve  a  decent rehabilitation  package  once  they  come  to  mainland    it  is  also  essential  that  such movement  and  rehabilitation  of  population  from  indian  enclaves  in  bangladesh and  bangladeshi  enclaves  being  transferred  to  india  does  not  lead  to  local resentment  and  social  tensions  that  is  why  i  would  propose  that  at  the  time  of entry the person would be provided biometric aadhaar card and his name would be  entered  in  the  national  population  register   secondly the  families  should  be housed  in  temporary  relief  camps  in  predetermined  locations  preferably  in  the same  police  stations  in  which  their  original  enclaves  were  located    the  family members should also be issued epi card bpl card and job card under mnrega  bank accounts should also be opened under jan dhan yojana  three issues were outstanding  between  bangladesh  and  india    one  is  the  undemarcated  land boundary  of  61  kms    as  per  the  radcliff  dispensation  the  line  was  drawn arbitrarily  much  to  the  disservice  of  the  neighbouring  and  adjoining  states  of bangladesh  namely  west  bengal  meghalaya  assam  and  tripura  i  would propose that rehabilitation should be proper and should be scientific  it is essential to  have  a  seamless  integration  of  bangladeshi  enclaves  with  the  local  area  and population    for  achieving  this  the  physical  and  social  infrastructure  of  these enclaves has  to be upgraded to the level of  neighbouring  areas   i  would propose that at the time of entry the person would be provided biometric adhaar card and his  name  would  be  entered  in  the  national  population  register    the  family members  should  also  be  issued  epi  card  bpl  ration  card  and    job  card  under mnrega  bank accounts should also be opened under jan dhan yojana
