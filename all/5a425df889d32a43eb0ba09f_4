  i  stand  here  to  welcome  and  support  the repealing  and  amending  fourth  bill  2015    law  is  to  ensure  easy  access  to justice  to  all    there  have  been  a  plethora  of  laws  on  the  same  subject  in  india  sometimes they are very much contradictory laws  we have to keep the laws to the  minimum  extent  of  what  is  required  for  the  country  as  not  all  laws  can  be implemented  many of the laws are of british era  so many laws are there which are not relevant today and have become obsolete  that is why the police and the other machinery are suffering  in fact ultimately the public is suffering  because of the plethora of laws millions of cases are pending in our courts  there is a need to integrate the similar laws to eliminate the laws which are useless and to make a concerted  effort  for  the  judicial  reforms  in  this  country    in  1998  when  the  nda was in government under the leadership of shri atal bihar vajpayee a panel was constituted    it  recommended  that  1832  laws  had  to  be  repealed  in  this  country  more than 400 laws were repealed  on the basis of the law commissions report and the pc jain commission report they recommended that 1741 laws are to be repealed    today 295 acts are to be repealed  i would also request the hon law minister  that  there  should  be  an  automatic  repeal  clause    section  6a  of  the general clauses act should also be amended  there should be a time bound action to  repeal  obsolete  redundant  and  unnecessary  laws    to  ensure  that  we  have maximum governance we require less and less laws
