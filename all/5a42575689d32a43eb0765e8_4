  iims  are  elite  institutions  of our  country    only  the  most  meritorious  students  finally  make  into  these institutions    additionally  the  high  fees  charged  at  iims  which  is  between  rs  9 lakh and rs 20 lakh also prevent several students from less privileged background from  taking  admission  to  these  institutions    there  are  currently  20  iims  across india  based on reports iims put together have about only 8000 seats  compared to this there are about 5500 other business schools that offer mba degrees  while i  commend  the  governments  effort  to  further  improve  the  standard  of  education and research at iims i also ask whether the government is aware of the fate of the other five lakh noniim mba degree holders  autonomous status and other things which are going to be implemented through the bill are very good  but what about others    according to  reports beside  the 8000  iim  graduates only  35000  of  the five lakh mba graduates get jobs  most of these jobs offer a salary of hardly rs 10000 per month  so i urge the government to take steps to improve the standard of these other bschools as well as secure the future of such students  moreover increased  fee  in  business  schools  and  unavailability  of  placements  are  the  two major  reasons  for  less  number  of  candidates  applying  for  the  common  aptitude test cat  every year there is a drop in the number of candidates applying for cat  one of the main reasons behind this drop is that a lot of students now prefer foreign universities over iims  in foreign universities there is a possibility and a chance  to  a  scholarship  but  after  this  new  bill  gets  enacted  will  there  be  a provision  of  scholarship  in  these  institutions    i  would  also  like  to  point  out  that certain  recommendations  of  expert  committees  formed  by  parliament  have  not been addressed to in the bill  i ask the government for a response regarding as to why two specific recommendations pertaining to board autonomy in pay fixation and  creation  of  standing  committee  for  management  were  not  considered  and whether  they  would  be  considered  and  implemented  in  future  or  not    i  want  to draw  your  kind  attention  to  iim  sambalpur    iim  sambalpur  is  running  from  a rented  building    my  request  to  the  government  is  to  clear  the  stand  of  the government with regard to signing of the mou in this regard
