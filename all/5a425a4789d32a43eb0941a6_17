 first  of  all  the  need  for  giving  the  stature  of  institute  of  national  importance  is something to which i would like to draw the attention of every hon member  this institution  has  an  allindia  presence  and  has  strived  hard  to  provide  very  good quality content of curricula  although it is observed by some of the hon members that  the  courses  were  very  charged  in  the  sense  of  the  fees  as  compared  to  many other  institutions    in  this  regard  i  would  like  to  say  that  the  course  is  selffinanced    i  am  not  saying  that  the  capital  expenditure  for  building  the  institutes will be taken from the students not at all  it means that the courses fee would be taken  from  the  students  and in that it is  fully  selffinancing  since  the nature of the course has been such and the job opportunities have been so very well knit the cost of the course has never deterred students from coming and joining  if we do not give that kind of a modern skill that skill which is very much linked with tastes and fashion we are not going to be able to have the better manpower  as we are aware  that  local  tanning  things  like  natural  residues  have  been  used  in  india  and today  indias  tanning  techniques  are  considered  to  be  very  good    international shoemakers  or  international  leather  product  makers  have  always  wanted  indian rawmaterials  in tamil nadu there is a lot of leather which is being tanned using kadukkai  which  is  also  considered  to  be  environmentfriendly    so  this  countrynot today but over the centuries has had leather tanning and it has given a steady flow  of  leather    that  has  never  obstructed  our  own  cow  protection  movements about which each one of us will have to be proud of and that has been a part of our freedom movements call  this country has given legitimate leather for the leather industry and that would continue  similarly with regard to women   i just want to underscore  the  point  that  in  the  existing  seven  campuses  the  malefemale  ratio between students is almost at equal  so women students have been given enough attention  and  place  in  our  campuses    there  will  be  enough  representation  of women  in  the  centres    as  regards  reservation  i  would  state  that  100  per  cent existing  laws on  reservations  for scs sts bcs  will  be  implemented  even  in the fddi  it would not be any different from any other institute in india   with regard to admission policy the running seven centres are admitting students on the basis of a common all india selection test the caist  similarly there has been a lot of voice about skill and skill imparting  i would like to add other than the courses which give degrees certificates and diplomas there are 96 centres in the country which are called training centres which train trainers  they are not only in those places  where  the  institutes  of  fddi  exist  but  also  in  places  in  states  where  the institute does not exist  with regard to opening of new institutes  at the moment we do not expect to expand more than 12 at this stage  we would like to limit it at 12 and prove our standards  we would try as much as possible when we design the contents  or  the  recruitment  or  the  campus  activities  to  involve  the  inputs  which each one of members had given us  the bill was passed
