   i am saying this because earlier the grant of mining  lease  was  based  completely  on  discretion  after  the  decision  of  the supreme court necessary amendments were carried out in the mines and mineral development  and  regulation  act  and  the  bill  was  introduced  in  2015  the necessary  provisions  were  made  by  replacing  section  11  with  a  new  section  11 which was introduced whereby the mineral concession was required to be granted only  through  auction  in  the  present  bill  section  12a  is  regarding  transfer  of mineral concession earlier the transfer of mineral concession was available only through  auction  but  the  captive  mining  leases  were  not  taken  into  consideration which  was  in  the  interest  of  development  of  the  mining  sector  therefore  the present bill is only with respect to including those mining leases where the captive mining  are  used  for  captive  purposes  but  the  proposed  licensingcummining leases are not made part of this bill it may  also be clarified whether this issue is also required to be taken into consideration or not
