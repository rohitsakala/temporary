 this bill prohibits children up to 14 years of age from working in any occupation however it allows them to work in home based work and those working in the audio visual industry i can only say that we cannot change  the  situation  through  legislation  alone  this  requires  a  huge  amount  of social change and movement which can come about if we are able to build a lot of awareness but unfortunately this bill does not encompass the iec provision that is  the  information  education  and  communication  aspects  they  are  not  made mandatory if we make it mandatory for all state governments it would help us in getting  rid  of  child  labour then population  stabilization  is  the  need of  the  hour finally  i  would  like  to  say  that  we  also  need  to  ensure  that  the  conviction  rate which is less than 10 per cent goes up
