  before  i  dwell  on this bill i would like to put on record my opposition to your ruling in relation to the  finance  bill  though  under  article  110  the  final  authority  rests  with  you  and this  has  to  be  accepted  by  all    our  hon  finance  minister  while  presenting  the budget tried to paint a rosy picture of our economy and also a sense of satisfaction was  distinct  in  his  speech  in  fact  in  his  speech  he  tried  to  convey  that  our economy was performing well and was ready to take off  we do not agree with it  we understand that our economy has been underperforming and in the prevailing circumstances  our  economy  could  not  reach  where  it  should  have  reached    the government has not been able to give impetus to our economy in these three years   our  gdp growth  rate  stands at 7  per  cent  even  after demonetization the  country should be satisfied about it  however it should be compared with the growth rate of 10 years period during the upa government  during upas 10 years rule the average growth rate stood at 78 per cent and thereafter promise of exalted achchhe din  was  made  and  naturally  the  growth  rate  should  have  improved    we  do  not have any exact data based on the new series as of now but taking into the account the new series formula introduced by the new government our growth rate during the  10  years  period  works  out  to  be  113  per  cent  instead  of  78  per  cent    many apprehensions are being expressed on the 7 per cent growth of our gdp based on the  new  series    the  government  should  give  convincing  reply  to  it  so  that  the credibility of our economy remains intact  seven per cent growth rate of our gdp is primarily consumption driven  we all know that in the last quarter of the year consumption growth has risen  it was due to good rainfall and implementation of the 7th pay commission  likewise the government is getting the windfall of steep reduction in the prices of oil  if the benefit of 7th pay commission and fall in oil prices is taken away then the actual growth rate of our gdp will come down to 6 per cent only  however the youths of our country need jobs  in the year 2010 the investment  proposals  relating  to  large  medium  and  small  industries  were  to  the tune  of  rs17  lakh  36  thousand  crore  and  also  in  the  year  2011  the  investment proposals received were to the tune of rs15 lakh 39 thousand crore and in the year 2016  the  investment  proposal  have  come  down  to  rs3  lakh  93  thousand  crore only  in fact when investments are made factories get set up and jobs are created   the capacity utilization in the industry was 80 per cent in the year 2011 which has come down to 70 per cent now  the health of our corporate sector is a concern for all of us  one more startling fact i would like to place before this august house as to  how  much  the  nonfood  credit  offtake  and  the  loan  amount  is  being  obtained for  setting  up  factories    the  industry  has  taken  the  least  loan  from  banks  in  the last  quarter  during  the  last  60  years  and  still  the  government  says  that  our economy is in good shape in the country  as far as exports are concerned when this government was formed in the year 201314 our government had left a trail of  262  billion  exports  per  month    after  three  years  of  this  government  the exports  stand  at  212  billion  we  should  have  taken  advantage  of  the  prevailing situation in the world which is being reflected in low prices of oil and commodities and  we  should  have  taken  advantage  of  the  stagnating  chinese  economy  as  well  however  we  have  failed  to  take  advantage  of  these  developments    india  should have become the factory of the world replacing china but this place is being taken by  the  countries  like  vietnam  and  bangladesh    there  are  several  sectors  like garment  apparel  and  footwear  etc  which  are  job  intensive  sectors  which  means that  these  sectors  create  disproportionately  larger  amount  of  jobs  for  every  one lakh  investment  as  compared  to  the  other  sectors    if  we  employ  our  finite resources  as  investments  in  these  sectors  then  we  can  not  only  replace  china among  the  major  exporters  in  the  world  but  also  provide  employment  to  the millions of youth keeping in tune with the promise made by your government for creating 20 million employment opportunities every year  the data on job creation which  is  coming  out  is  worrisome    the  international  labour  organisation  has estimated  that  india  is  the  only  emerging  economy  in  the  world  where unemployment  is  going  to  grow  for  the  next  two  years  ie  in  the  year  2017  and 2018  the formulation of taxation policy of a country should be directed towards addressing  the  problems  like  jobless  growth    therefore  when  corporate  tax  was cut we had hoped that some sectors  would be provided package  however what the government has done is that it has reduced the corporate tax rate from 30 per cent  to  25  per  cent  across  the  board  in  respective  of  those  companies  whose turnover is less than 50 crore  this is not the right policy  i would like to urge the government that keeping in mind the prevailing state of economy and the kind of gloomy  forecast  about  the  job  creation  being  made  by  the  world  agencies  the government should provide sector specific breaks otherwise we will not be able to face the situation  taxation policy has an important role to play in addressing the gap between the poor and the rich  today as far as taxation is concerned the tilt is very  much in favour of indirect taxes which are to be shared by all equally  the direct  taxes  have  been  decreasing  while  the  indirect  taxes  have  been  increasing during the last three years  the direction of economic policy is a matter of concern and it is causing and will continue to wider the gap between the poor and the rich  we  have  to  ponder  over  the  policy  framework  which  does  not  allow  this  gap  to increase    the  tax  on  petroleum  is  considered  one  of  the  most  regressive  and retrograde in nature  the excise duty during our government was rs 110 per litre of  petrol  and  rs 135  of  one  litre  diesel  which  has  been  increased  upto  rs 895 and 796 respectively i would like to demand that the government should reduce the  duty  on  diesel  and  petrol  by  atleast    rs  5  so  that  this  message  could  be  sent across the country that while the government is inclined towards cutting the rate of corporate tax it is also considerate towards reducing the duty on diesel and petrol  the credit off take of the banks has come down at the lowest level during the last 58 years and the advance tax mop up of the government until march has increased at a rate of only 6 per cent  these are alarming signs  i would like the government to  pay  attention  towards  the  policies  which  may  strengthen  the  economy  of  the country    the  government  has  also  been  trying  to  impose  a  very  draconian measure  on  the  people  of  the  country  through  this  finance  bill    there  is  a proposal  of  vesting  more  power  into  the  hands  of  income  tax  authorities  with regard  to  search  and  seizure    through  this  measure  there  is  a  preparation  for unleashing the tax terrorism in the country  under the subsection of the 1 a of the section 130 of income tax act it is clearly stated that the income tax officials are obliged  to  give  the  reason  before  they  carry  out  search  and  seizure  operation  however  now  the  government  propose  an  amendment  in  this  section  and  this requirement has been dropped under it   earlier the power of making a subjective decision  lied  with  the  income  tax  officials  but  some  objective  material  was required  for  it    now  it  is  being  said  that  there  is  no  requirement  for  any  such material and it has been completely deleted  this is wrong and against the  tenets of  natural  justice  and  such  provision  does  not  exist  anywhere  in  the  world    not only this the government propose to implement the proposal retrospectively from 1962    i  would  like  the  government  to  pay  attention  towards  this  provision    i would also demand that the government should also fulfill the promise it had made for  raising  the  exemption  limit  of  personal  income  tax  upto  rs  5  lakhs    the government  had  also  promised  to  implement  of  the  swaminathan  commission  our government during its ten years tenure had continuously increased the msp of wheat  bazra  and  paddy  etc    however  this  government  has  only  effected  an increase of 4 per cent per annum during the last three years in place of an increase of 15 per cent  and still the government talks about the doubling of the income of the farmers  therefore it is our demand that the government should implement the recommendations  of  the  swaminathan  commission    i  also  demand  that  all  our suggestions  related  to  the  finance  bill  should  be  accepted  to  give  the  necessary fillip  to  the  slow  moving  economy  and  to  create  necessary  employment opportunities for the government to fulfill its promise of creating 20 million jobs
