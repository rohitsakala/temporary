  before  independence  the  gdp  share from the agriculture sector was more than 50 per cent it has now declined to less than  20  per  cent    especially  the  situation  of  states  like  tamil  nadu  karnataka kerala  andhra  pradesh  telangana  and  maharashtra  is  grave    huge  deficit  in rainfall  and  crop  losses  are  reported    in  the  last  three  months  over  200  farmers have died either of shock or they have committed suicide in tamil nadu alone as has been reported  unfortunately the budget reflects an insensitive and inhuman attitude  of  the  government  towards  the  suffering  of  the  peasants  and  agricultural workers    the  government  has  gone  back  on  its  promise  of  ensuring  minimum support  price  msp  for  crops    according  to  the  recommendations  of  the swaminathan commission the msp should at least be 50 per cent above the cost of  production    whereas  msp  of  most  of  the  crops  are  far  below  their  cost  of production  similarly the decision to import wheat at zero import duty is leading to dumping of wheat  this will lead to a further crash in prices as the incompetent government  has  no  effective  procurement  plans    the  government  must  make preparations on a war footing to procure wheat gown by our farmers facing great adversities  at  remunerative  prices  with  incentives  over  and  above  the  minimum support price  on the issue of mgnrega  the government is claiming that it has allocated a sum of rs 48000 crore for this programme  the budgeted rise in allocation for mgnrega is just 11 per cent  there are huge arrears of wages for work  done  remain  unpaid  and  is  according  to  reports  the  amount  stands  at  rs 14000  crore    while  the  government  is  claiming  that  they  have  given  a  lot  of benefits  to  the  farmers  but  budgetary  provisions  are  meager  as  compared  to  the previous  year    coming  to  the  increase  of  disasters  in  the  plight  of  the  farming community in the country the farmers suicide has increased by 42 per cent  about 68  per  cent  of  farming  households  are  under  debt    the  price  of  fertilizers pesticides and insecticides are beyond control  so once again i term this budget is a betrayal of the peasantry of our country
