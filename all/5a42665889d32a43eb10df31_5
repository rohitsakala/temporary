    we  consider  workers  as  a very  valuable  asset  for  the  country    it  is  only  because  of  their  hard  work  and patience that india is growing at a very fast pace  as we all know for any industry or for any society wealth is important  if the industry is doing well and if they are having  wealth  the  wealth  should  be  shared  by  the  workers  and  the  society    i would  suggest  the  hon  minister  that  bonus  also  should  be  linked  up  with productivity then productivity will increase in this country when the trade union politics  should  be  minimised  in  the  industries  then  only  the  productivity  will  be increased    we  are  insisting  on  all  the  companies  to  increase  their  csr  to  two percent   i  would  also  like  to  suggest  the hon minister  that at  least one percent profit of every company should be given to their employees in the form of bonus in addition  to  what  this  bill  proposes  to  give    we  should  always  try  to  give  social security  and  safety  to  our  workers    we  have  very  weak  labour  laws  even  after independence    we  have  to  make  stringent  labour  laws  for  the  welfare  of  the workers  of  the  country    i  want  to  congratulate  our  hon  minister  for  bringing  a wonderful bill for the welfare of the workers of this country
