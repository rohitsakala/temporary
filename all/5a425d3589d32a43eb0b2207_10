  as  the  backwards  and  dalits recognise  the  value  of  their  votes  their  representation  will  rise  in  the  legislature  in the next 50100 years the backwards and the dalits will have an overwhelming presence  in  the  executive  also   the  backwards dalits poor the  weaker  sections had  reposed  faith  in  the  hon  prime  minister  that  they  would  get  justice  in  all organs of governance  and their faith has not been belied  however they are yet to  get  adequate  representation  in  judiciary    this  should  be  done  even  if  several amendments  are  needed    the  judiciary  should  honour  the  wishes  of  the parliament  otherwise it would be an insult to our democracy    the minister of law and justice shri dv sadananda gowda replying said  as far as this bill is concerned i would like to base my arguments  on  the  articles  which  are  laid  down  under  the  constitution    i  would like to draw the attention of the house to article 142 of the constitution  it clearly mandates as to how the judgements of the supreme court should be responded by the  government    any  judgement  that  has  been  rendered  by  the  supreme  court need to be implemented under article 1421 of the constitution  i do not want to clarify much about njac because a final verdict has not yet come  the parliament cannot over write the judgement  as per the directions of the supreme court this has been brought as a bill before the parliament  i am only explaining the reasons as  to  how  this  could  be  justified    i  never  said  that  it  is  mandatory  for  the parliament  to  obey  the  judgment    the  parliament  is  supreme    i  do  not  dispute that    an  advocate  for  getting  a  pension  has  to  complete  14  years  of  service    if someone is appointed at the age of 52 or 54 then he is going to retire at the age of 62 and in that event he will not be eligible for full pensionary benefits  this is in order to give some incentive and see that that there is no discrimination at the stage of his retirement  the other thing is that an advocate after retiring as a judge at 62 years cannot relocate himself because he cannot practice in the same high court  at present there are huge vacancies  the judgement of the supreme court is only advisory to draft this bill  apart from this we have covered other aspects also with regard to leave and other things  there were several anomalies  they might have struck  down the  njac  but  subsequently they  have  continued  the  same  bench  to hear some  more suggestions from various corners and stakeholders  a few other questions have been asked by our friends regarding establishment of the supreme court  benches  and  high  court  benches  in  the  various  parts  of  the  country  specially article 130 is very clear as far as that matter is concerned  unless it is concurred  by  the  chief  justice  of  india  the  present  act  does  not  permit  to  go ahead  as regards the high court bench the state government with concurrence of the chief justice of the concerned high court has to move the papers  no such proposals  have  come  from  any  of  the  state  government  so  far    any  resolution passed by the legislature itself will not be sufficient in this mater  any movement by  the  government  is  not  sufficient    it  should  be  concurred  by  the  concerned chief justice of the high court also  as far as salaries are concerned at present the  chief  justice  of  the  supreme  court  gets  rs  1  lakh  per  month  and  the  chief justice of the high court gets rs90000 per month  that is on par with the report of  the  law  commission    as  far  as  salary  is  concerned  the  seventh  pay commission  has  already  submitted  its  report  to  the  government  and  the government is  yet  to  finalise it   as far  as other issues  are  concerned no  serious concern has been expressed by my learned colleagues  of course they expressed certain  grievances  against  the  judiciary    there  is  a  need  for  some  more  judicial reforms the bill was passed
