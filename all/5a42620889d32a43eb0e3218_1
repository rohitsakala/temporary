  i  am  on  my  legs  to speak  on  the  child  labour  prohibition  and  regulation  amendment  bill  2016 however  this  debate  does  not  hold  much  significance  as  the  government  enjoys here full majority  the child labour amendment bill provides for prohibition on the employment  of  the  children  below  14  years  in  all  sorts  of  work  provided  this ceases  to  be  applicable  in  the  cases  where  children  help  their  family  or  family enterprises  after  school  hour  or  during  holidays    but  the  government  forgot  that only relatives have been found guilty   in most of the cases of forcing the children to work it has also been accepted that children can work from 46 hours  but who will  ensure  as  to  how  long  they  are  working    whether  the  bureaucracy  or  the police  who  intends  to  earn  benefit  in  collusion  with  those  business  men  and  the corporate world  i would like to reiterate that no one cares for the children because they  are not voters  the  children  have  been put to  commercialization   it  sounds very good in black and white that the extent of penalty has been increased but only 4474  persons  have  been  brought  to  book  since  the  enforcement  of  child  labour act 1986  it is a matter of shame that the penalty imposed for the violation of the said  act  was  merely  rs  20  and  rs  25    hence  only  increasing  the  extent  of penalty  is  not  going  to  stop  the  exploitation  of  the  children  in  the  country  according  to  the  government  figure  there  are  only  50  lakh  child  labour  in  the country whereas the 2011 census reveals that the number of child labour was 125 crore  thus  it  is  nothing  but  the  maneuvering  of  the  government  figure    now  i would like to talk about  their  rehabilitation   the  children  rescued  from  the  child labour should have been properly rehabilitated  it is claimed that the rehabilitation scheme  is  being  implemented  in  66  districts  of  the  country  but  the  number  of beneficiary children is only 6 lakh  although this bill prohibits the employment of children in certain hazardous industries and factories the hazardous work has not been  defined  therein    furthermore  the  ministry  of  home  affairs  do  not  put  the begging  children  into  the  category  of  child  labour    to  me  this  subject  does  not belong  only  to  the  ministry  of  labour    the  ministry  of  human  resource development  niti  ayog  the  ministry  of  labour  the  ministry  of  finance  the ministry of social justice should have brooded over it collectively  this stands to be  a  great  responsibility  of  the  government  towards  them    like  china  our population is also burgeoning  but we do not want to toe its line  the government should invest in the education of the children as the report of the world bank also admits  that  if  they  learn  the  basics  read  and  write  the  growth  rate  of  gdp  will increase by 037 per cent annually  in 10 years only on the basis of education gdp will grow by 10 percent  hence first of all the government should have provided food to those poor people who put their children to work for a square meal instead of  bringing  this  amendment  in  order  to  provide  benefit  to  the  corporate  and industry world  the government talks about the elimination of the child labour and at the same time promotes family enterprises   prostitution and the exploitation of the  children  have  been  encouraged  in  the  name  of  family  enterprises  by  this amendment  this bill does not provide for the liberation of those children who are working  in  the  unorganized  sector    this  is  a  serious  issue  and  hence  the government  should  think  about  the  children  cutting  across  the  political  line  and accept the suggestions made by the people like kailash satyarthi
