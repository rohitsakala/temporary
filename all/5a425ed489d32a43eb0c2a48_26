  we had brought this bill in the year 2011 the government had brought this bill but it was conceptualised by us we support the  idea  of  the  bill  but  we  have  some  objections  in  this  bill  while  making changes in gst bill the parliament will not be taken into confidence it means legislative competence of the parliament has been ignored somewhere it is not appropriate  shri  arun  jaitley  had  talked  about  simplification  of  tax  structure but whether concept of one tax is found after looking at the said bill we will find  that  there  is  a  provision  of  cgst  igst  and  sgst  it  means  one  tax  by union  governance  one  tax  by  the  state  government  one  interstate  and exportimport  tax  not  only  this  the  provision  of  seven  slabs  has  also  been made  under  it  besides  this  there  is  provision  of  cess  also  it  is  against  the concept of one nation one tax  mentioned by you during the discussion on this bill the respected prime minister shir narendra modiji has said that gst dream could not be realised till it infrastructure network with taxpayer is not set up in the entire country through you i would like to ask the government as to  whether  work  in  regard  to  gst  software  design  has  been  completed  it  is going  to  be  implemented  from  july  1  if  preparations  are  not  made  then  it  is going to be second disaster in the fourfive months you have done one disaster in the form of demonetisation the common man will be in problem he will be clueless where to go which tax to be deposited where to be deposited where to be deposited how much tax to be deposited the problem will increase in the condition of uncertainly therefore there is need to pay attention in this regard there  is  need  to  work  on  gst  infrastructure  the  big  traders  have  started working on it infrastructure but small traders and farmers are not aware of it gst is an indirect tax indirect taxes are considered regressive we have made a demand  to  put  cap  of  18  percent  in  gst  but  the  government  did  not  agreed the  indian  economy  runs  on  60  percent  services  therefore  the  government must pay attention in this regard tax should be either 12 percent or 18 percent only
