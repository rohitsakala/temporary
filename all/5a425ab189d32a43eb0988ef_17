 the bill which is lying dormant for 27 years has been brought today for the introduction and also to pass this shows the will of the government  i would like to stress only on two or three points  this bill  has  been  brought  to  eradicate  benami  transactions    but  here  everybody  has mentioned about property only whereas there are many assets a person can create through benami transactions  secondly in any case executor and judge cannot be the  same  person    similarly  in  the  matter  of  benami  transactions  one  can  appeal from  appellate  tribunal  to  high  court  and  supreme  court  also      sometimes  it takes a long period of 30 to 40 years to dispose of the cases  it is my request that there should be a time limit  there should be provision of providing incentives in this bill if a property worth 100 crore rupees is revealed then it would be better to provide  10  to  20  per  cent  incentives  in  this  case    apart  from  this  geo  tagging should  also  be  completed    at  last  i  would  like  to  say  that  honest  should  be protected and those who are guilty must be punished
