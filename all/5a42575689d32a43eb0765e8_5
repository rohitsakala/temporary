  the  most  important  thing  which  i  like  in  the bill is the autonomy given to these institutes  that is what we required for a long time  unless you give autonomy along with responsibility and accountability we will  not  get  the  desired  results    apart  from  20  iims  there  are  hundreds  of institutions  which  are  functioning  in  the  market    we  do  not  have  any  idea  as  to what  sort  of  education  they  are  imparting  to  the  students  who  are  studying  over there  i would like to ask the government that whether there standards equivalent to  that  of  iims    secondly  government  has  made  provisions  in  this  bill  that  all these  iims  will  be  under  the  purview  of  the  rti  also    so  we  will  have opportunities  to  know  what  is  really  happening   apart  from  that some  institutes are indulged in current practices with regard to admission process  similarly fees are  very  high  which  one  cannot  afford    students  who  had  taken  loan  for  their education are not able to repay their loan just because they have not got the job of that  remuneration  or  of  that  quality    so  we  have  the  increasing  npas  on  this account also  this is again a matter of concern  so what is the government going to do to protect talented students  apart from the existing institutions suppose a new iim is to be opened than i would like to know from the government that who has got the power to form the board  in the education field when we talk about reservations  and  other  things  then  we  have  the  talented  people  from  our  scst categories  also  therefore  we  should  impart  a  very  high  and  standard  level  of education to our students
