  in view of the impending elections in the state of west bengal in the  month of may 2016 amendments to the representation of the people act 1950 and delimitation act 2002 are necessary because the areas between  our  country  and  bangladesh  have  been  exchanged    also  a  situation between  the  states  of  andhra  pradesh  and  telangana  arises  because  seven mandals  of  telangana  state  were  transferred  to  the  state  of  andhra  pradesh through an ordinance  areas with 90 per cent of voters in the assembly segment of bhadrachalam in the state of telangana were transferred to the state of andhra pradesh    now  in  this  country  those  people  are  neither  represented  in  andhra pradesh nor in telangana  this is a very unfortunate situation  i would request the government  to  bring  a  bill  as  early  as  possible  to  clarify  the  situation    i  would request  the  hon  law  minister  to  bring  a  comprehensive  bill  with  regard  to  this exchange of villages in both the states
