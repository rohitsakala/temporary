 this is one of the finest drafted bill that i have ever  come  across    things  like  mood  perception  behavioural  disorder  which impairs  judgementa  and  things  which  are  functional  in  nature  should  have  been categorized as behavioural disorder and not as mental illness  the bill talks about only  one  disorder   that  is schizophrenia  though  there  are  five or six disorders  as per the psychiatry association   the government overenthusiastically is trying to classify even the maniac psychosis which is called bipolar disorder as a psychiatry illness      in  psychiatry  the  disorder  most  frequently  seen  is  the  bipolar  disorder and the manic depressive psychosis  the intention of the government seems only to treat a disorder where a person would only threaten himself and the society  i request the hon minister that the definition of mental illness should include mood disorders  behavioural  disorders  perception  disorders  and  those  disorders  which impair the ability of judgment
