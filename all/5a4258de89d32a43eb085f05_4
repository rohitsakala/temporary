  we  are  happy  that  through  this  step andhra  pradesh  which  is  not  really  a  new  state  will  see  further  development  these days these times are times when we should be talking about energy synergy  there is a need to harness the potential of both conventional as well as renewable sources of energy  our dependence on fossil fuels needs to be challenged  people should be encouraged to increase their dependence on renewable energy  i have a suggestion  just  call  this  institute  the  indian  institute  of  energy    while  the proposed  university  can  work  towards  developing  better  technology  involving renewable energy it should simultaneously work towards reducing our dependence on hydrocarbons  i would suggest that all the related institutes should be brought together under one umbrella  they may be mandated to work on methods how to get  rid  of  those  which  pollute  the  atmosphere  and  whose  use  damages  the  earth  therefore  move  away  from  those  sources  of  energy  into  alternative  energy    in these  institutes  research  would  be  focused  on  finding  new  renewable  sources  of energy and encouraging their adoption throughout the country  even the general council has members only from hydrocarbon industry who will obviously not like the  country  to  move  to  renewable  energy    the  membership  composition  implies that  traditional  thought  and  traditional  mindset  will  not  only  continue  it  shall  be further strengthened with private enterprise
