  firstly  at  the  stage  of  the  introduction  of  the bill i opposed the raising of fees of iit to rs 2 lakhs per year i think it is totally antipeople please ask the iits to reduce the fees immediately secondly i support the  bill  otherwise  for  setting  up  iits  at  tirupati  jammu  bhilai  palakkad  goa and dharwad and converting indian school of mines dhanbad into an iit but i ask the hon minister that he has given only rs 230 crore for six iits and rs 100 crore for indian school of mines why has the government given so little money in  reply  to  a  question  the  minister  had  correctly  said  that  in  spite  of  very  good work done by iits in the past our iits are nowhere in the first 250 ranks of global education therefore we have to do something to really improve iits further my suggestion  is  the  iits  should  go  for  fresh  collaboration  with  top  american  and british universities i would like to ask hon minister as to why to our best nuclear scientists  resigned  from  the  board  of  governors  of  iit  bombay  we  should persuade such people to come back into this  iit alumni especially those who are established  abroad  to  come  forward  and  give  money    please  approach  them  for getting both money and cutting edge technology  i am told that 80 per cent of the students  of  iit  bombay  go  to  america  and  most  of  them  do  not  return    let  us inculcate  values  in  them  so  that they  love  the  country  and  stay  back     you  must bring up iit tirupati or iit palakkad to the level of iit bombay
