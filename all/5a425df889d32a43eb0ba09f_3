 the central government has taken a comprehensive  review  of  laws  and  the  legal  system  with  a  view  to  removing  the incoherent and redundant laws  it is a good effort to unburden our statue books  i would like to bring to the notice of the government that this year this is the fourth time that such a repealing and an amending bill has come to parliament  do we have a proper historical documentation of these laws  the way we are going about it seems like to unburden our statute books to make them slimmer we are getting rid  of  part  of  our  history    the  law  commission  has  given  suggestion  that  1741 laws  needs  to  be  changed  why  are  we  dealing  in  piecemeal  is  a  suspicion  that would  strike  i  suggest  that  a  committee  comprising  of  lawyers  and  historians should look at these repealed laws or the laws to be repealed and ensure that this does not become a habit  but let us keep a record of the laws that we are repealing  the old and draconian laws have harmed many people in this country  there are certain acts which needs to be relooked at  i would suggest that there should be a debate on the uniform civil code the moment you start differentiating dividing society you fall prey to the evil organisations like the isis
