 there is clearly overoptimism as too much is expected from voluntary disclosure and penalties while incentives are not in place  let us not forget that the union budget of 201718 was presented under the  shadow  of  the  impact  of  demonetization    the  consensus  among  most economists  is  that  demonetization  will  impose  a  significant  cost  on  the  economy and  the  economic  survey  itself  recognizes  this    the  survey  recognizes  that  the informal sector has suffered substantially  more than the formal sector  moreover the  government  hoped  to  raise  rs  30000  crore  as  taxes  from  rs  65000  crore declared under the income disclosure scheme but it is likely that rs 30000 crore may not be realized as taxes if the black income declarant is able to explain in the source  of  his  income    in  respect  of  demonetization  no  numbers  have  been disclosed on how much of the demonetized currency notes have come back to the reserve  bank  of  india    i  would  also  demand  that  government  should  present  a white  paper  to  parliament  indicating  all  the  details  on  unaccounted  money  and wealth stashed abroad and also the generated income concealed within the country and  the  extent  to  which  justice  m  b  shah  task  force  recommendations  have been  implemented    as  far  as  transparency  in  political  funding  is  concerned  our party biju janta dal believes that transparency in funding of political parties must be promoted in public interest  therefore i would insist that it is better every pie or every rupee that is being donated to a political party should be in public domain  the  prevailing  situation  regarding  tax  treatment  of  agricultural  income  is ambiguous    if  i  have  an  income  of  around  rs  50000  or  rs  100000  which  is agricultural income only i will not be taxed  however if i have other sources of income and these specific words are added to it for rate purpose it will be added and  the  incometax  will  be  imposed    so  i  want  to  know  whether  the recommendation of some committee or the government did it on its our wisdom  moreover i fail to understand as to why aadhar card is being linked to pan card  this has not been discussed in the house till now
