  as  far  as  the  state  of  uttarakhand  is  concerned notwithstanding  what  the  courts  decide the  passage  of  this  bill  is a  constitutional necessity    otherwise  there  will  be  a  grave  crisis  as  far  as  uttarakhand  is concerned  this is the first time in the history of independent india that out of 67 members  present  35  or  36  are  giving  it  in  writing  stating  that  we  have  voted against the budget and the budget is still declared to be passed  therefore there is a  serious  doubt  and  a  cloud  whether  a  budget  has  been  passed  or  not    after  the budget  has  passed  the  speaker  of  the  house  has  to  certify  and  write  to  the governor  that  the  budget  has  been  passed  and  the  governor  has  to  accept  that  but  from  18th till  the  midnight of  27th  of  march when  the  council of  ministers recommended  action  under  article  356  no  recommendation  or  certificate  had come that the budget has been passed  there is a serious doubt about the passing of the budget  on the 31st of march having proclaimed the presidents rule the central  government  was  faced  with  a  question  as  to  what  happened  to  the  socalled budget that has been passed on the 18th of march  what happened on the 18th  of  march  itself  was  doubtful  so  we  issued  an  ordinance  in  support  of  the appropriation bill itself sanctioning the appropriation for the financial year 201617    it  is  that  ordinance  along  with  the  budget  has  come  up  for  consideration before this house today    now various things can happen  if any new government is formed of either party it will be entitled to call for its own session  pass its own budget and make changes  to  whatever  we  are  doing    alternatively  if  the  presidents  rule  is  to continue then i have asked for an appropriation for a period of four months so that the  expenditure  of  the  state  can  go  on  in  the  meanwhile    therefore  as  a constitutional  necessity  we  should  approve  the  budget  the  appropriation  for  a period of four months and the ordinance which has been issued
