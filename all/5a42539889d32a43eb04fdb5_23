  we  are  opposed  to  the imposition of presidents rule in principle because for the first time in the history of  independent  india  the  akali  government  under  the  leadership  of  gyan  singh radewala  was  dislodged  by  using  article  356    again  in  1980  the  badal government  was  dislodged  by  using  the  same  article    today  the  congress leaders  are  opposing  the  imposition  of  presidents  rule  in  uttarakhand    it  is because now they have realised what is the pain of using article 356  it is true that we  have  to  think  about  the  situation  that  has  arisen  in  uttarakhand  today    there was no other alternative before the central government but to impose presidents rule there and they have done so out of compulsion
