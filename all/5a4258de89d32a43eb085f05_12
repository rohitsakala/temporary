  i  support  the  bill  because  there  is  a need to seriously discuss the issues concerning petroleum and renewable energy  i would  like  to  say  that  the  petroleum  companies  would  benefit  from  the  research and  development  work  of  the  proposed  institute    so  we  should  make  these petroleum  companies  partner  and  take  contribution  from  them   we  have  to have some  kind  of  bond  so  that  the  students  graduating  from  this  institute  should undertake  research  work  for  at  least  five  years    i  would  like  to  make  one  more request  because  this  institute  is  likely  to  largely  focus  on  kg  basin    there  are other areas like refineries in panipat and bhatinda  we should set up institutes in these areas also
