    there  should  be  a  clear  direction  as  to whether  the  centre  will  continue  with  the  cess  and  how  the  states  have  to manage the losses after period of 5 years  i suggest there should be a permanent mechanism  for  the  same  in  case  of  gst  the  proposed  40  per  cent  tax  is abnormally  high  as  few  european  countries  have  but  education  and  health facilities  are  free  of  cost  in  those  countries    taxation  under  the  gst  for essential  services  alone  cannot  be  justified    the  government  should  make proper  utilisation  of  the  funds  received  from  the  new  tax  regime  for  the universal  provision  of  essential  goods  and  services    industry  needs  time  to adopt the new system  they should be given adequate time and they should not be  harassed  for  slow  compliance  particularly  the  small  and  medium  scale enterprises    the  multiple  tax  slabs  goes  against  one  nation  one  tax  this again complicates the tax system  13th finance commission had recommended a  uniform  rate  of  12  percent  and  keeping  essential  goods  and  services  outside the  tax  net  the  government  must  be  very  particular  that  the  lobbying  by different interest groups does not influence this classification of goods and also not to complete the process in a hurried manner   the government must clarify as to why it is not following the devolution formula as suggested by the finance commission  the  constitution  does  not  allow  a  tax  to  be  levied  or  collected except  by  the  authority  of  law    then  by  what  intention  is  the  government proposing  to  notify  the  cgst  rates  on  its  own  without  approval  of  the parliament    whatever  rules  and  laws  be  framed  by  the  government  they should  not  surpass  the  constitution  and  should  ultimately  benefit  the  common people of the country and not some selected business entities and corporates
