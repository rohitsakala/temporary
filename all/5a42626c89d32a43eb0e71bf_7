  i  congratulate  the  hon  minister  for  placing this noble  idea to tap  the vast  waterways    i  would  like  to  know  whether  there is any budget provision for inland waterways  i would like to know whether there is any feasibility or techno study made by the government  there are five national waterways that are still functioning    in kerala kollamkottapuram stretch was commissioned  earlier  but  it  is  not  yet  fully  utilised  for  the  want  of  funds  waterways  is  the  cheapest  and  environment  friendly  mode  of  transportation    it also reduces accidents to a great extent  even after 68 years of our independence our progress in this sector is not at all satisfactory  in this bill it is seen that the states have to contribute 26 per cent to meet the expenditure  this does not come in the concurrent list  i think the centre itself has to take the total expenditure  the government has declared 108 national inland waterways for development but no feasibility or techno study has been made  when the bill says that there is no detailed study completed how can these 108 waterways be considered  as far as kerala is concerned there were eleven rivers earlier and now the number of rivers has  reduced    i  would  like  to  know  whether  it  was  the  suggestion  of  the  state government  or  whether  it  is  the  suggestion  made  by  the  expert  committee  from here    with  regard  to  the  kollamkottapuram  stretch    i  have  said  that  though  it was commissioned earlier yet it is not fully utilised  the state government needs financial  assistance  for  the  fulfilment  of  this  stretch    this  stretch  has  to  be extended  to  the  kozhikode    it  would  be  better  if  it  is  extended  from  kollamkozhikode  to  kasargod  because  the  state  government  has  an  idea  to  have  a navigation process from the south to the north  there is sufficient infrastructure facility
