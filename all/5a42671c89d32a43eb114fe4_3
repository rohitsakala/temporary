 the bis is a body which determines the indian  standards  and  also  it  harmonizes  the  national  standards  with  authentic international  standards    this  bill  will  be  helpful  for  the  consumers  and  the businessmen alike  the main functions of bis are standardisation formalisation certification  granting  licence  to  use  trademarks  on  the  products  and  processes under  licence  and  to  take  delineate  actions  against  the  defaulters    our  standard regime  is  still  in  a  nascent  stage  of  development    indian  exports  face  many difficulties on grounds of meeting mandatory standards  we are extending the bill up  to  the  services  but  the  term  services  is  not  clearly  defined    it  enables  the governments  to  bring  mandatory  certifications  regime    there  will  be  selfdeclaration  of  conformity  against  any  standard    this  will  also  enable  the government  of  india  to  implement  mandatory  hallmarking  of  precious  metal articles  but  there  are  other  metals  like  iron  brass  and  steel  which  are  very important  for  the  consumers    it  has  not  specified  the  accreditation  process  for checking laboratories  the wgc study said that the bis lacks adequate resources for testing monitoring and enforcement  anyway this bill is quite good
