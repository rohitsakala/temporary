 the government claims  that  it  is  an  exhaustive  aggressive  and  progressive  legislation    but  there may  be  inexhaustive  suggestions  and  there  may  be  inexhaustive  promises  and demands which also should be taken note of  decades have passed when we are still  undergoing  the  hiv  and  aids  epidemic  and  still  profound  stigma  and discriminations are attached with the lives of those suffering from this disease  so first of all my suggestion to the government is that mass awareness is the need of the hour without comprehensive mass awareness programme government would not  be  able  to  get  the  common  people  away  from  the  spectre  of  the  stigma  and discrimination    however  most  of  the  recommendations  of  the  standing committee  have  been  accommodated  in  this  legislation    integration  of  hiv  and aids  intervention  in  primary  healthcare  system  has  taken  place  in  india  from 2010  onwards  and  during  2016  india  pledged  to  follow  targets  to  fast  track  the pace  of  progress  towards  ending  hivaids  as  a  public  health  threat  in  the  next five  years  and  ending  the  epidemic  by  2030    we  are  also  aware  that  this government  is  pursuing  the  sustainable  development  goal  whereby  it  has  been committed  that  by  2030  the  aids  and  hiv  epidemic  will  be  wiped  out    to implement  the  sustainable  development  goal  the  government  requires  funds  to the mindboggling amount of rs55 lakh crore  so i do not know how the funds will be mobilized by the government  i would like to know from the government about  its  fasttrack  target  and  that  are  the  fasttrack  targets    the  bill  misses  the fasttrack  target  of  2020  about  which  i  would  like  to  be  enlightened  by  the government  i would also like to know the rate of hiv that has turned into fullblown  aids  in  india  the  government  should  issue  a  clarion  call  to  each  and every indian that we are striving and we need a vision of zero new hiv infection zero  discrimination  and  zero  aids  related  deaths  india  records  around  68000 fatalities  every  year  from  acquired  immuno  deficiency  syndrome  and  related infections    whereas  the  national  aids  control  organizations  budget  has  been reduced by  a  whopping  22 per cent  which  left the  state  governments to  fend  for themselves  there is a controversy over section 141 of this legislation  the bill has  not  addressed  the  demand  for  the  removal  of  fourword  phrase  as  far  as possible  of  clause  141  which pertains to  the treatment  of  hiv  affected people  the  four  words  as  far  as  possible  dilutes  the  objective  with  which  indias  aids control  programme  has  worked  so  far  therefore  i  would  urge  upon  the government that to dispel the fear of the affected people these four words as far as possible  should  be  deleted  from  this  legislative  document  i  would  like  to  know from the hon minister whether our blood banks in the states are equipped enough to screen the blood which is not tainted with or which is not infected with hiv and aids    the  2006  draft  of  the  bill  was  comprehensive    it  not  only  protected  the rights  of  plhiv  but  also  the  mostatrisk  population    the  bill  does  not  have elements  regarding  the  outlines  of  policy  change  funding  and  normalisation  of hiv plus individuals in society  the bill has severe drawbacks in terms of fiscal responsibility    the  bill  provides  for  the  establishment  of  only  one  ombudsman  however we need more  ombudsmen   again tuberculosis is  the  leading cause of death for people with hiv worldwide  however tb can be cured but i have found nothing in this legislation in regard to my contention about tb
