    in  201213  201314  or  in  the  last  two years what was the rate of inflation is a question of figures only  in 201213 the food price inflation was in double digit that is 102 percent and in 201314 it was 95 percent  the rate of food price inflation was 122 and 113 percent respectively in the last two years of the upa regime  the wholesale price index was 74 and 6 percent respectively during the same period  for 18 months in a row this country saw a negative wholesale price index  it was 08 percent in the month of may and 16 percent in the month of june  so what comparison are we talking about  the increase  in  the  prices  of  vegetables  in  the  month  of  july  is  a  matter  of  seasonal increase  the price of sugar remained at rs 2223 per kg for months together  at this  price  the  farmers  could  not  get  remunerative  price  for  sugarcane  and  that resulted  in  the  closure  of  several  sugar  mills    the  sugar  mills  were  not  making payments to the sugar cane growers  in this situation  the government intervened took  measures  and  a  sum  of  rs  27000  crore  of    farmers  that  was  outstanding against the sugar mills came down to rs 15  thousand crore only  had prices of sugar remained static at rs 3032 per kg the farmers would have got the payment for their sugarcane  but when the prices of sugar started increasing gradually the government imposed a ban on its export so that the rising prices of sugar could be brought down  presently sugar prices are hovering around 3334 rs per kg  the increase  in  the  prices  of  pulses  is  indeed  a  cause  of  concern    the  present requirement  of  pulses  in  the  country  is  about  23  million  tonnes    whereas  the country produces only 17 million tonnes of pulses  so in such a situation we have to import pulses to make up this gap of 6 million tonnes  we have signed a long term  mou  with  mozambique  for  importing  pulses    a  reference  has  been  made with  regard  to  petroleum  prices    it  is  true  that  prices  of  crude  have  come  down  how has india used  and this is being globally commented upon  this reduction in crude prices  that additional resource is used by the centre for capital investment and  infrastructure    the  highway  sector  had  to  be  revived    the  railways  needed more  investment    the  port  sector  needed  more  investment    investment  in  rural roads  had  to  be  increased    therefore  the  nda  government  used  this  entire investment  we made up for the loss of the oil companies  we passed on benefits to  the  consumers  and  we  used  the  third  part  of  the  share  also  in  larger  public interest by diverting it into public investment  we empowered the states by giving them  more  resources  so  that  they  would  also  make  public  investment    if  india today  for  two  years  in  a  row  is  the  fastest  growing  economy  in  the  world  it  is thanks  really  to  this  public  investment  and  to  the  fdi  that  has  been  coming  into this country  i would like to say this only kindly compare the situation during the regime of  the upa government with that of the present nda government as that would amply clear the air
