  the  juvenile  justice  care  and  protection  of children  bill  2014  has  been  introduced  by  the  hon  minister  to  replace  the  act passed in this house in the year 2000 the crux of the bill is with regard to the trial of  juveniles  as  adults we  have to discuss and  debate on in detail   about 80 per cent  of  the  juvenile  offenders  come  from  desperately  poor  and  deprived  socioeconomic  backgrounds    it  is  their  harsh  upbringing  that  is  primarily  responsible for them turning to crime  there are a few clauses which are good for example the constitution of the juvenile justice board earlier the conducting of inquiry was not  specified  clearly  whereas  in  this  bill  it  is  very  clear    with  regard  to  child welfare  committees  also  the  hon  minister  had  taken  good  steps  to  for  the functioning  of  these  committees    it    is  good  that  these  special  juvenile  police units and child welfare police officers are constituted  but i do not know how budget is going to be allocated because law and order is a state subject  i do not know  whether  this  union  government  will  support  the  states  to  have  this functioning  in  each  police  station    with  regard  to  adoption  also  the  provision made in this bill is laudable i would request the hon minister to consider deleting this provision  which is there  in  clauses 716 193  and  20 of  this  bill  wherein a juvenile who is aged between 16 and 18 years if he commits some heinous crime is  to  be  tried  as  an  adult    i  think  this  is  not  a  good  provision  in  the  present circumstances    i  would  request  the  hon  minister  to  see  that  this  clause  is withdrawn
