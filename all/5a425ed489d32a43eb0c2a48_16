  the  concept of one  country one  tax  of  the  gst  is  being  commended  by  the  economists  of  not  only  this country  but  those  across  the  world    i  think  that  this  will  take  the  economy  of our  country  ahead    in  my  opinion  the  maximum  benefit  through  this  system will be this that the tax leakage will be removed and the difficulty to the trader moving across the states will end  this will increase revenue which will boost the  economy  naturally    this  is  the  biggest  decision  of  the  government  with regard  to  tax  reform    the  government  will  have  to  ensure  that  the  tax  payer does not face any difficulty  no tax payer should feel any burden while paying tax    the  government  has  made  slabs  of  512182840  per  cents however  an additional cess of 15 per cent is also likely  it has not been decided on which items this cess would be imposed who will impose this cess and how will it be imposed    we  want  that  the  cooperative  societies  should  be  exempted  from  it otherwise the common poor people of punjab and other several states will have much loss due to it  there is a talk across the country that tax will be levied on ancillary professions of agriculture such as poultry dairy fishery etc  no one can  carry  on  agricultural  activity  without  these  ancillary  professions    the farmer  ekes  out  a living  through  one  ancillary  activity  or  the other     if  that is taxed  he  will  have  much  loss    i  want  a  clarification  in  this  regard  by  the government  at least the income from land should be exempted  i feel that it will be a dangerous thing if tax is imposed on leased property  gst should be implemented on petroleum products  i appreciate this bill
