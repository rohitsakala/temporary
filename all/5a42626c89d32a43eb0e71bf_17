  through this  bill the  government propose  to  increase  the  number  of  waterways  from  the  present  5  to  106      the condition of even existing waterways is pathetic and no substantial traffic is taking place  through  them    i  would  like  to  request  the  government  that  present waterways should be interconnected with the railways roads and ports which will automatically  increase  the  transportation    the  flow  of  water  in  our  rivers  is dependent on nature and the flow of water in them is not constant throughout the year    without  taking  into  consideration  this  aspect  the  implementation  of waterways transportation seems very difficult  even the experts are of the opinion that  too  much  expansion  of  waterways  will  result  in  increased  danger  of  water pollution because the pollution caused by the emission of water vessels will result in  pollution  of  water  bodies      it  is  very  essential  to  consider  over  these  points before we develop our waterways
