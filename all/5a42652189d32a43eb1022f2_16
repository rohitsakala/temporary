    i  felt  that  the  hon  finance  minister  should clarify  two  things  in  the  bill  firstly  the  success  of  the  gst  system  is  largely dependent  on  the  width  of  its  coverage  but  the  proposed  gst  regime  has excluded  many  items  such  as  potable  alcohol  tobacco  and  petroleum  products which account for a large chunk of indirect tax base in the country secondly the one  per  cent  extra levy  has  been  proposed  to  be  charged  when  goods  move  from one state to another every time goods move from one state to another and the tax will  go  on  increasing  it  will  have  a  cascading  effect  on  the  cost  in  the  supply chain  sir  i  have  given  three  amendments  which  are  in  the  interest  of  the  union territory of puducherry our puducherry unit of the party had studied the bill and had given some suggestions they are thankful about the fact that the government has  accepted  their  suggestion  to  insert  a  new  article  366  26b  in  the  definition clause for state which includes a union territory with legislature with reference to article 246 a 268 269 a 279 a the provision of the current bill does not pave  way  for  devolution  of  union  revenue  constitutionally  under  article  275  and 280  that  is  through  central  finance  commission  so  my  amendment  is  with regard to the inclusion of article 270 275 and 280 in the definition of state for the purpose  of  devolution  of  revenue  from  central  pool  secondly  article  279  a clause 4 g provides for goods and services council to make recommendations to the  union  and  the  states  on  special  provisions  with  respect  to  certain  states  my amendment to this subclause g is to include puducherry in the list of states and uts  the  legislature  of  puducherry  has  been  consistently  demanding  statehood and  special  status  for  a  long  time  hence  puducherry  should  be  included  in  the special  provision  states  thirdly  section  182  of  the  bill  excludes  union territory with legislature from the share of one per cent additional tax on supply of  goods  for  two  years  or  such  other  period  recommended  by  the  gst  council puducherry  uts  revenue  should  be  protected  in  the  transition  period  from  vat regime to gst regime hence my amendment to section 182 to insert the words without legislature along with union territories
