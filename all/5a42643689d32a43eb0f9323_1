 in the financial memorandum to the bill it has been clearly stated that every teacher appointed or in position as on 31st march  2015  who  does  not  possess  minimum  qualifications  as  laid  down  under subsection 1 of the section 23 shall acquire such minimum qualification within a period  of  four  years    that  is  the  crux  of  this  amendment  bill    that  is  why  i welcome  this  legislation    there  are  certain  issues  which  the  government  has  to seriously consider and implement  one is the amount that is needed has been put in the sarva shiksha abhiyan  there is extreme neglect of the primary education in  the  budget  201718    the  budget  has  ignored  the  effective  implementation  of the right to education act and a meagre increase for sarva shiksha abhiyan has been made in the budget  we have certain data especially from the northeast in states like nagaland where 42 per cent of government teachers are untrained  so it  is  a  big  challenge    there  are  states  like  kerala  or  tamil  nadu  where  there  is excess  of  trained  staff  and  many  training  institutions  are  now  closing  down  one after another  so the government has to find a way out because on the one side in some  states  we  find  that  trained  teachers  and  especially  in  the  north  eastern states we find that there is a large number of untrained teachers  the government also  has  to  find  adequate  finance  for  running  the  sarva  shiksha  abhiyan  and  the midday  meal  scheme    by  this  important  legislation  we  are  bringing  all  the children in the country up to the age of 14 or eighth standard under the education system    but  the  sad  fact  is  there  are  children  who  get  all  the  privileges  in  good schools paying high fees and on the other side we see there are children who do not have any type of education and this is not a small number  the percentage of such children who do not get the facility of better education is going up every year  so  the  government  has  to  find  a  way  out  if  we  are  going  to  implement  this legislation in letter and spirit that every child in the country should have a facility for  education    there  are  vacancies  in  government  schools    i  am  very  confident that  the  things  would  improve  everywhere    i  am  proud  that  in  kerala  the government  teachers  are  well  educated  and  they  have  got  good  standards    it  is because they have been selected in such a manner  but the real problem is lack of infrastructure    now  in  the  private  institutions  education  itself  has  become  a business  one has to pay a huge amount of money to get admission of his ward in these  private  schools  which  an  ordinary  persons  cannot  afford  it    so  in  the government schools both the central government and state governments have to think together as to how to provide better infrastructure  in the case of midday meal  scheme  now  the  government  is  giving  instruction  that  aadhaar  is compulsory  for  getting  the  benefit  of  this  scheme    but  how  many  students  have got  aadhaar    i  am  not  against  aadhaar  but  it  should  not  be  misused    we  all support this bill but the government should take due care of the areas such as midday meal infrastructure issues etc  it is not only the responsibility of the central government but the state governments should also come forward and contribute  as far as the education is concerned right from students admission to the teachers appointment everything should be taken care of  what i suggest is that both the central  government  as  well  as  the  state  government  should  work  hand  in  hand and see that our education system improves
