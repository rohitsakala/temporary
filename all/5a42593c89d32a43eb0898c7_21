  in  ancient  times  students  from  all  over  the world used to come to india for studies  today india is competing with the world  we  have  a  number  of  prestigious  institutes    though  we  have  not  been  able  to make  progress in the  field of  education at  desired pace   indian  students  are  very intelligent in all streams  indian scientists are bringing laurels to isro  i think if they get support from the government they can bring laurels to the country  so i request the hon minister to provide all facilities to the students  our students go to foreign countries  if they get opportunities they will certainly earn name in their respective fields and will stay in the country itself  i would urge the hon minister to  develop  syllabi  and  evolve  teaching  patterns  of  international  standards  with indian  touch    research  is  important  for  any  institute    so  research  for  faculties should  be  compulsory    poor  students  especially  those  belonging  to  scheduled castes  and  scheduled  tribes  fail  to  afford  admissions  due  to  high  fees    the government should develop some mechanism to assist them in paying fees  there should be a complete ban on ragging in educational institutes
