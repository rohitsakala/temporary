  before  the  government  went  to  the rajya  sabha  our  suggestion  was  incorporated  as  an  amendment  went  to  the amendments  and  subsequently  a  select  committee  was  formed    the  select committee suggested certain suggestions and those suggestions unanimously have been accepted in passing  i would only say when we are dealing with scheduled areas which are demarcated by the constitution schedule v and schedule vi it is a sensitive area and a sensitive issue  in that respect let us not rush through certain bills  and  certain  amendments  in  such  a  manner  because  of  the  majoritarian outlook  i would think this government that in their wisdom they have corrected the  mistake  that  was  being  committed  and  all  mineral  bearing  states  by  these amendments  are  going  to  be  benefited  tremendously  especially  those  people  who reside in schedule v and schedule vi areas i would only ask that in this district mineral foundation and how they are going to function how that money is going to pass on for the area development of those mineral where the mining is going to take  place   that  needs  to  be  monitored   i  think  the  government of  india  would take the state government into confidence and ensure the welfare of the displaced persons and the mine workers
