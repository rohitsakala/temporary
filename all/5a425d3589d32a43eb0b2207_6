    with  respect  to  this  bill  personally  i  am  not against any emoluments being given to the judges  those who do service should be given necessary remuneration salary allowance pension etc  i would like to ask hon law  minister  as to  what happened  to  njac   they  struck down  an  act which has become the will of the people  the people of the country were taken for a ride  there is a need to make the judiciary accountable
