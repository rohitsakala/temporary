  it is the mindset of this government to share power with the states  this government believes in federalism  and  believes  in  strengthening  the  hands  of  the  states  and  this amendment  is  aimed  at  taking  the  power  to  the  states    one  hon  member  from tdp  said  that  instead  of  crediting  the  supreme  court  it  should  be  treated  as  an amendment  which  is  desired  by  the  people  india  and  therefore  the  parliament should take the credit for it  i want to say that it is a very well amendment which is brought  here  whether    in  recognition  or  in  following  up  of  the  supreme  courts decision or in following up of the law commission it is actually happening here  it is the will of the elected members of the house which is going to pass this  i fully  agree  with  the suggestion  on  ethanol  mix  for  energy  efficiency  and  also  for the  sake  of  protecting  environment      this  government  is  taking  a  lot  of  steps towards  it    in  doing  so  we  are  ensuring  that  farmers  get  better  price  for  their produce   so far as gst is concerned whatever is going to happen in the process of getting gst i do not need to speak about it  but one thing which will have to be very clearly voiced is that with this bill the amendment that we are bringing in here  is  more  to  define  with  clarity  what  is  with  the  state  and  what  is  with  the centre  at present the excise duty on potable alcohol is being levied by the state governments    government  are  opposed  to  the  supreme  court  verdict    that comes under a separate act and is not covered by this one at all  i hope eventually alcohol or ethanol which is produced goes towards energy efficiency goes towards improving  our  use  in  the  fuel  efficiency  rather  than  for  production  of  potable alcohol which goes for human consumption which does have a detrimental effect on human health  the bill was passed
