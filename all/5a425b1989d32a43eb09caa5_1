  i would like to oppose the introduction of  the  citizenship  amendment  bill  2015  the  facts  and  statements  of  the minister are absolutely contradictory  this kind of legislative exercise is adversely affecting  the  legislative  supremacy  of  parliament  and  also  the  concept  of  the sanctum  sanctorum  of  democracy    the  specific  objection  of  the  bill  is  that through  this  bill  a  new  amendment  is  being  incorporated  in  section  iiiee where the citizens of indian origin have to be defined in the new bill  there is no statement of objects and reasons for the proposed amendment  there is also an ordinance    i  would  like  to  know  as  to  what  is  the  urgency  of  promulgating  the ordinance  hon prime minister had made a commitment to the persons of india origin  if that being the case then my question to the government is that in order to  fulfill  the  commitment  why  this  provision  was  not  being  incorporated  in  2014 bill  and  in  the  ordinance  which  was  promulgated  on  6th  january  2015    that means the legislative exercise was being taken in a callous way
