  shri  arun  jaitleyji  is  right  that  as  finance minister of the country it is incumbent upon him to avoid any constitutional crisis that may emerge if the uttarakhand state government is unable to spend after the 1st  of  april  but  the  constitutional  crisis  that  may  happen  on  the  1st  of  april  is actually  precipitated  by  the  decision  of  the  cabinet  on  26th  of  march  what  was there  in  front  of  the  hon  president  of  india  and  in  front  of  the  cabinet  which showed and was evidence of the fact that the elected government of uttarakhand was not going to be able to function as per the provisions of the constitution the governor on 18th evening knew that the entire battle was about the appropriation bill  and  only  27  mlas  wrote  to  the  speaker  of  the  house  to  ask  for  a  vote  by division it  was  not  the  majority  on  27th  if  the  minority  asked  for  a  division  of vote madam you are not bound to do it they only signed the memorandum much later this is an absolute travesty of justice and every attempt of this government to scuttle a floor test has ultimately been set aside by the hon courts
