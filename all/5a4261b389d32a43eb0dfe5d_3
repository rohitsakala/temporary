  the  present  bill is comprehensive  and  includes  access  to  health  care  treatment  rehabilitation insurance  right  to  choice  of  treatment  but  most  importantly  decriminalizes attempt  to  suicide  and  regulates  mental  establishments    these  vulnerable individuals  need  support  and  care    mental  patients  face  social  stigma    public needs to be aware  they need to be accepted in the society and they should not be confined    there  need  to  be  a  budget  for  creating  awareness  through  tv  and media messages etc they need access to mental health care  there are only about 3500  psychiatrists    we  need  more  institutions  like  nimhans    we  need psychologists and they are even more scarce in the country  bill has a provision for insurance cover of mental illness  but irony is that government cannot force insurance  companies  to  cover  such  persons    there  is  a  lacuna  in  the  bill  and  it does  not  protect  the  property  of  the  mentallychallenged  people    another  very important  point  is  to  distinguishing  and  codifying  behavioural  disorder  from mental disorder otherwise criminals will take shelter on this
