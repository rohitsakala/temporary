  i support the institute of petroleum and energy  bill  2017    if  we  carefully  go  through  the  contents  of  the  bill  it  clearly mentions that since energy sector is developing with traditional hydrocarbon sector and  new  sources  of  energy  like  liquified  natural  gas  bioenergy  and  renewable energy  are  also  coming  in  the  market  with  hydrocarbons  this  institute  would undertake  advance  research  work  in  these  areas  to  secure  and  maintain  leading position in this field  as we are aware that the traditional hydrocarbon sources are decreasing and it  is  required for  the  future  of the  coming generations  to  focus on nontraditional  sources  and  new  sources  of  energy    there  is  big  reserves  of  oil shales  in  india  which  could  certainly  be  used  for  future  generations    i  would request  the  hon  minister  that  western  uttar  pradesh  haryana  and  rajasthan  are such states where there are sufficient reserves of hydrocarbons and nontraditional hydrocarbons so one such institute should also be set up there  at last i want to say that our government believes in knowing and then doing the right thing
