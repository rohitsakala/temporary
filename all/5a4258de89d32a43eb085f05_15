  i  support  this  bill    i  hope  this institution  would  be  invested  in  making  the  country  selfreliant  in  the  field  of energy    the  oil  prices  are  at  its  lowest  level  of  the  last  1015  years    but  the common man is not benefitting from it  i would like to request the hon minister that  the  benefit  of  reduced  prices  should  reach  the  poor  also    the  prices  of domestic lpg should not be beyond the reach of the common man  i come from bihar  an ambitious project namely haldiajagdishpur pipeline project is being executed  there  by  the  government  i  would  request  the  hon  minister  that  the network  of  this  pipeline  project  should  be  extended  across  the  state  of  bihar  so that the common man could get clean fuel at lower prices
