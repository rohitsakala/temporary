  the  object  of  the  bill  regarding  the  10 years  addition  for  being  eligible  for  pension  for  the  lawyers  was  very  much needed   on  the point  of  appointment of  judges we  are not getting good lawyers because of the collegium function is not properly done till now  in the collegium system if he likes the person then the person is good and if he does not like the person then he is bad  so the collegium system has failed  if required you may call  for  a  national  debate  on  this  subject  as  to  what  should  be  the  appointment procedure of the judges in the high court and the supreme court regarding the salary  of  the  judges  this  is  really  a  small  amount    at  the  same  time  i  would request  the  hon  law  minister  to  constitute  a  judicial  commission  to  fix  up  the salaries of judges  so far as infrastructure is concerned  there are a large number of  vacancies  in  the  country    immediate  steps  should  be  taken  to  fill  up  the vacancies  in  every  district  and  in  every  state    again  i  would  request  to  make  a law  that  after  their  retirement  the  judges  will  not  be  accommodated  in  any position    this  should  apply  to  ias  officers  also  another  suggestion  is  that  if lawyers are to be appointed as judges appoint them at least when they are 45 years old    but  why  at  the  age  of  60  just  for  two  years  for  the  purpose  of  giving  them pension  just  after  two  years    it  should  not  be  done    regarding  circuit  bench  i would request the hon minister to make a constitutional amendment if doorstep justice has  to  be delivered then  the  circuit  bench of the  supreme  court  must be there in all the regions of this country
