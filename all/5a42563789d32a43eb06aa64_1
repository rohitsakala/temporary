 this act has been named as care and protection of children  there are 34 sections on which i would like to emphasize  section  75  clearly  states  that  newspaper  and  channels  should  not  publicize  or exaggerate anything about children  section 752 also  states that police will not disclose  any  record  with  regard  to  children    i  used  to  run  deaddiction  camps  whenever  we  approach  the  police  by  taking  juveniles  to  them  you  will  be surprised to know that police right away deny by saying that they cannot provide shelter  for  them    in  this  condition  they  will  have  to  be  sent  either  to  jail  or  to remand homes  they need such an open environment in which they can quit drugs and  shun  crimes   i  would  like  to  thank  the  hon minister  for  making  mention  of militant  groups  in  section  84  of  this  bill  in  which  provisions  of  seven  years imprisonment  along  with  a  fine  of  rs5  lakh  have  been  made    when  child commits a crime he is completely discarded by the society  in this situation legal process involved in adoption is quite complex  i would like to state that definition of adoption should be modified to promote it  i would request the government that certain  clause  should  be  made  in  this  regard    when  we  think  about  a  juvenile offender  it  is  necessary  to  understand  the  mentality  of  the    juvenile  as  to  under which circumstances he was compelled to commit such crime  then only we will be able to provide better protection to them and only then will they destined to be a good  citizen  of  this  country    it  is  also  necessary  to  identify  their  skills  and  to provide them some short of vocational training  then we can be assured that after completing the sentence given by juvenile court they are not going to be  criminals again    i  would  also  like  to  request  that  some  sort  of  parameters  should  be prescribed  for  ngos    if  anybody  of  1618  years  of  age  commits  any  heinous crime he should be given severe punishment for that  but he should also be given at  least  two  opportunities  to  correct  himself    we  should  be  sympathetic  towards children  and  on  the  other  we  have  to  be  strict  with  criminals    i  think  this  act strikes a balance between both
