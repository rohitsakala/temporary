    every  child  is  a  blessing  of  god representing  the  greatest  asset  of  a  nation  and  its  future    it  is  unfortunate therefore when a child has become a labourer i our prevailing social system  for poor countries children are economic assets  i say that by introducing clause 5 of this bill the central government is opening a back door to bring child labour  is it that  the  child  will  be  permitted  to  work  after  school  hours    this  really  hits  the basic concept of the act itself  i would request the hon minister not to press upon clause  5  itself    in  india  millions  of  children  under  the  age  of  14  years  work  as labourers  in india the percentage of child labour is 23  we are the highest in that figure  while child labourers can be found in urban dwellings around 80 per cent are  reside  in  rural  areas  where  they  are  forced  to  work  in  agricultural  activities such as tanning livestock rearing forestry and fisheries  the founding fathers of the constitution emphasize the importance of the role of children and the need of their  development    dr  ambedkar  projected  the  childrens  rights  in  the  directive principles  of  state  policy  as  their  deprivation  had  a  dangerous  effect  on  the efficiency of the democracy and the rule of law  there is no dearth of acts in our country  but the problem is the implementation of the acts and execution of the acts  the national child labour project which started its operation in 1988 was an integral part of the national policy on child labour  the special schools under the nclp are run by the ngos local selfgovernment bodies or directly by the project  society    the  child  labour  is  getting  decreased  there    the  central government is responsible for not eliminating child labour from the soil of india  education eradicates illiteracy and provides means to economic empowerment and opportunity to live  a  better life  everyone  has the  right to  education  unfortunately  it  has  not  been  implemented  in  the  entire  country    therefore  i would  like  to  end  that  there  are  laws  but  we  have  to  implement  then  fully    the labour minister of the  government of  india  must take  care  and  see  that they  are being implemented  child labour must be eradicated through promoting education and  well  planned  poverty  alleviation  and  developmental  schemes  as  well  as through the imposition of trade actions on employment of children
