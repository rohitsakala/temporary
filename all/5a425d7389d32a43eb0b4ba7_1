  the  bill  is  a  proposal  to  amend  the  mmdr act  1957    through  the  current  amendment  of  2016  the  government  wants  to insert  a  clause  that  will  allow  transfer  of  captive  mining  leases  granted  through routes  other  than  auction  this  will  facilitate  banks  and  financial  institutions  to liquidate  stressed  assets  to  my  mind  this  amendment  is  in  favour  of  inefficient mining  enterprises  rather  than  investing  in  technology  solutions  to  enhance efficiency   this  in  effect  means  that  the central  government can  make  arbitrary new rules on a case to case basis in allocation of mining leases  in the state where the private landowners have the right and a lot of hurdles are there there must be a  constitution  amendment  for  guaranteeing  proper  land  price  as  well  as  for protection of customs and traditions so that mineral wealth exploitation continues unhindered  by  private  landowners  rights    i  think  make  in  india  should  also include  the  exploration  of  mines  and  minerals  for  selfsufficiency  in  mineral requirement  as  well  as  for  export  for  generating  substantial  foreign  exchange    i want the minister to take note of this and have a proper examination
