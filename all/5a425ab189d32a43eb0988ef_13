  i  would  like  to  congratulate  hon prime minister and finance minister for bringing in an amendment after a lapse of 28  years    this  is  really  a  very  important  bill  brought  in  before  the  lok  sabha  today corruption is the commonly used word in our country  people are resorting to corruption  to get  their  work done  and they  have  completely  sidelined the  right course  people are giving bribes because they avoid paying so many taxes levied under  our  taxation  system    and  moreover  it  has  become  very  difficult  to  earn money honestly and earn a livelihood easily nowadays most of the black money generated in this country is being invested in the real estate  black money invested in this sector is not disclosed before the government authorities  people are of the opinion that if they have to pay 55 per cent tax on their hard earned money to the government  then  why  be  honest    so  there  is  a  need  to  bring  comprehensive change in the taxation system  protection should be provided to those people who are honest  the hindu undivided family has been well defined in this bill and it will  provide  relief  to  the  common  people    again  there  is  a  need  to  curb  the tendency  of  threatening  the  common  people  by  the  income  tax  officials  restrictions should be imposed on generation of black money through this bill and protection must be provided to those who are honest
