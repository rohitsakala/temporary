  the  demand  for granting  constitutional  status  to  the  national  commission  for  backward  classes has been raised for the last 25 years  however it is really unfortunate that despite so  many  successive  governments  coming  to  power  during  this  period  no  one showed  any  promptness  in  finding  out  a  permanent  solution  to  the  problem  of backward classes of the country  this government has paid heed and understood the  pain  of  backward  classes  and  it  is  by  taking  cognizance  of  this  long  pending demand the government has taken this step of providing the constitutional status to the  national  commission  for  backward  classes    the  entire  house  should cooperate in passing this bill because this is an historical act which will go a long way in shaping the destiny of these backward classes in india  in response to the issue of usurping the rights of the states is concerned  i would like to say that this change  being  brought  by  our  government  is  targeted  at  making  the  parliament supreme    the  steps  being  taken  by  our  government  are  meant  to  bring  more transparency    better  decisions  in  the  interest  of  the  country  will  be  taken  on  the platform of this august house  the inclusion or exclusion of any caste will not be dependent on the whim and fancies of an individual rather such decisions would be taken on the basis of objective data and scrutiny of the parliament  i would also like to request the government that the demands of obc community related to the subjects  like  setting  up  of  a  separate  ministry  for  obcs  raising  the  ceiling  of creamy  layer  releasing  the  data  of  caste  census  and  ensuring  the  participation  of obcs from the presidents secretariat to judiciary should be met
