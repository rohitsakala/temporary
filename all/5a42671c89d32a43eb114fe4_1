  the bis hallmarking  is essential for the indian industries  to  facilitate  the  export  of  their  goods    the  biggest  beneficiary  will  be indian consumer because he will be assured that he is getting quality product  this bill  was  essential  to  make  india  a  world  leader  in  the  realm  of  industry    the biggest  benefit  of  this  bill  is  that  when  we  will  approach  the  wto  they  have  a rule  that  if  there  is  a  standard  for  any  product  in  our  country  we  will  have  to export  the  same  standard  of  product  in  other  countries    besides  the  bis  has formulated over 19300 standards for more than 9500 products but only 92 products are covered  i would like to thank the hon minister that he is thinking of covering more than 400 products  the more products we cover it would be better  besides services and processes have been covered in this bill for the first time  it is a very good step  moreover the planning for smart cities food even drinking water are also  being  brought  under  its  ambit    i  would  like  to  give  some  suggestions    my first  suggestion  is  that  there  is  misuse  of  isi  mark  in  the  country  on  large  scale  there  are  many  companies  which  manufacture  substandard  goods  but  sell  these goods  after  embossing  isi  mark  on  these  goods  and  consumer  is  unable  to distinguish  as  to  these  goods  are  fake  or  genuine  ones  there  should  be  a mechanism in place to check the genuineness of goods across the country  if we are  giving  self  accreditation  power  to  industries  and  if  they  do  any  wrong  there should  be  stringent  punishment    similar  provision  should  also  be  made particularly for food items
