  it is an excellent piece of legislation    most  important  is  that  there  is  a  heavy  pressure  on  the  national highways  particularly  the  national  highway  connecting  chennai  and  howrah  this route is extremely congested  perhaps the buckingham canal which has been sanctioned to us from kakinada to puducherry would help in decongestion of this route  and  reduce  the  risk  of  accidents  on  this  national  highway    but  so  far whatever investments have been made in inland waterways is very negligible and the investment that has been made for the national highways could be considered for  an  investment  in  the  inland  waterways    tourism  particularly  pilgrimage tourism  has  become  extremely  popular    this  aspect  should  be  taken  into consideration    already  we  have  inland  waterways  of  which  one  is  with  us  and technofeasibility has been completed for 50 projects  the government may take the  rest  of  the  projects  on  top  priority  to  reduce  the  pressure  on  the  rail  and  the roads  we do not have perennial rivers there  therefore to ensure regular water supply  and  to  make  it  successful  the  government  should  think  of  regular  water supply either to take it from the sea or to connect it with other rivers  that is most important to make it most successful  in some places it has been mentioned that as much  as  rs5  lakh  crores  would  be  spent  in  ten  years    i  am  sure  that  instead  of spending  the  amount  from  the  government  exchequer  it  may  be  considered  by way  of  publicprivate  partnership  rather  than  spending  it  from  the  public exchequer  the government has appointed mohandas pai committee to look into inland  waters    that  committee  report  may  kindly  be  implemented  early    the most important point which i want to mention here is that where irrigation projects are feasible they should be considered to make a comprehensive waterway system  the natural flow of water into the waterways has been blocked at various places  so while implementing the projects the hon minister may look ingo the inflow of water  from  various  places    if  it  is  not  done  i  am  sure  that  it  may  not  be  very successful    similarly  when  it  is  taken  up  silting  also  should  be  done simultaneously  at regular intervals if silting is not done i am sure it will not be very successful
