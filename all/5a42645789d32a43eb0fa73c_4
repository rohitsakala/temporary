 today we are discussing the sikh gurudwara amendment bill  i question its timing  some people have mixed religion with politics  when we go to pray nobody stops us but we are not allowed to vote  i want that everyone who considers the guru granth sahib the guru and goes to the gurudwara  for  prayer  should  be  allowed  to  exercise  his  franchise  to  elect gurudwara prabandhak committee
