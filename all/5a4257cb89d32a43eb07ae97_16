  it  has  been  seen  across  the  tenures  of  various governments that the route of ordinance is followed whenever government wants to favour the capitalist industrialists and the elites  today the government has brought this bill for setting up the commercial courts  its fine but the initial route of ordinance by the government is not justified  the government should bring such a bill which could ensure prosperity and progress for the country  i request that the government should  review  this  bill  and  send  it  back  to  the  standing  committee    it  may  try  to bring it back once the standing committee considers it    the minister of law and justice shri dv sadananda gowda replying said the purpose of the bill is to accelerate economic growth improve the international image of the indian justice delivery system and the faith of  the  investor  world  in  the  legal  culture  of  the  nation    commercial  disputes require  better  understanding  and  specialization    continuously  keeping  some judges who are not specialized in the subject also creates delay in the disposal of the cases  here in the bill we have made a provision as to how persons who are specialized in commercial matters would be posted and how they are to be trained  commercial  matters  should  be  dealt  with  separately    this  bill  does  not  violate article  14  of  the  constitution  and  it  does  not  infringe  upon  any  right  of  poor people  by taking away commercial matters from the normal courts they can deal with other cases quickly and speedy disposal can be brought about  recently we passed  a  bill  the  delhi  high  court  amendment  bill  2015  where  we  have enhanced  the  jurisdiction  of  the  district  court  of  delhi  from  rs20  lakh  to  rs  2 crore  in commercial courts bill the original jurisdiction of the delhi high court is rs 2 crore and above  once the delhi high court amendment bill is notified automatically all the cases of commercial disputes below the value of rs 2 crore will  be  transferred  to  the  district  court    so  we  thought  it  fit  that  both  these legislations should be brought together  as a result the delhi high court bill was notified and simultaneously the commercial courts ordinance was promulgated  we promulgated this ordinance to avoid confusion  a few of our friends said that it ought to have been referred to the standing committee again  but i want to say that when the standing committee was taking evidence from various stakeholders the  ordinance  was  brought  to  the  knowledge  of  the  standing  committee    in  its report  everywhere  they  observed  that  this  ordinance  has  been  promulgated  and concurred with it   some of the members mentioned about pecuniary jurisdiction  in this regard i want to say that if the government feels it can certainly enhance the pecuniary jurisdiction of the court  one of my friends asked as to why appeal has  to  be  made  in  the  high  court  only    in  this  regard  i  want  to  say  that  where there  is  an  original  jurisdiction  the  commercial  bench  will  be  established  there and  commercial  appellate  division  also  will  be  there    so  automatically  the appeal  will  go  from  the  original  side  to  the  appellate  side    with  regard  to pendency of cases this government has taken several initiatives and that is why so many  cases  have  been  disposed  of  rapidly  in  various  courts    about  pendency  in the high courts as on 31122012 it was 4434 lakh and as on 31122014 it had come down to 4153 lakh  we will computerize all the courts  about pendency in the district and subordinate courts the pending cases have been reduced by four lakh  i hope that this bill will have a bigger impact on judicial reforms the bill as amended was passed
