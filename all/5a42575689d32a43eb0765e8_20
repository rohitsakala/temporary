  my first suggestion is with regard to  the  coordination  forum    the  mandate  of  this  forum  should  be  extended    in  a recent  assocham  report  it  is  stated  that  barring  these  20  iims  there  is  only  7 per cent campus placement in the remaining business schools which are providing mba  degrees    therefore  these  iims  could  play  the  role  of  a  mentor  for  other business schools so that their standard also could be improved  our iits and iims are  one  of  the  best  brands  in  the  world    therefore  the  council  of  iits  and  the coordination  forum  for  these  iims  should  work  in  close  coordination    the foundation  stone  of  the  iim  in  my  parliamentary  constituency  rohtak  laid  in  the year  2011  but  so  far  only  35  per  cent  of  work  has  been  completed    i  therefore request that the construction work of this iim should be expedited
