  i  also  wholeheartedly appreciate  him  for  bringing  out  a  wonderful  legislation    it  really  protects  the consumers  and  brings  in  the  standardization    the  bill  is  silent  if  the  promoter takes advance without registration and needs to be addressed  the conditions of 12 apartments and above 500 square meter should be deleted  it requires balancing of the  promoters  as  well  as  the  interest  of  the  buyers    we  suggest  that  more concessions may be given to affordable housing like the tax holiday less interest etc so that the middle class and the poor will also get benefited  whether housing should  also  be  given  an  infrastructure  status  is  a  longpending  issue    the  bill  is also  silent  on  the  required  defaulters    we  need  to  define  the  carpet  area    one important point is those who are working either in the regulatory authority or in the  appellate  either  as  the  heads  or  as  members  they  should  not  be  allowed  to reemploy  in  the  private  sector    as  regards  50  per  cent  amount  more  than  the deposits  monitoring  of  withdrawals  is  required    lastly  the  black  money  is  the fountain head but it is really silent on that
