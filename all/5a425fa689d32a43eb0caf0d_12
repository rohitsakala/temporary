 i rise to speak in support of this bill    people  of  the  country  wanted  such  a  bill  for  a  long  time    in  the  previous years the real estate builders plundered the people the farmers householders and ditched  everyone    money  was  collected  from  a  large  number  of  people  on  the promise  to  deliver  homes  to  them    there  are  even  such  builders  who  sold  lands meant  for  roads  even  sold  green  parks    a  commission  should  be  set  up  to determine where the money earned through such practices has been deposited  the clause to deposit 70 per cent of the amount in the banks in my view would check black money   lastly i thanked my government for bringing an important bill
