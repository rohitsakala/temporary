 it is very good to have autonomy of such institutions  but i am not sure whether total autonomy is very good for any of the institutions or a person even  i would only express some apprehensions about this bill    first  of  all  is  that  the  formation  of  the  board  itself  is  fallacious    so  how come  the  board  can  appoint  the  persons    in  case  some  illegally  irregularity corruption  or  nepotism  goes  on  in  this  board  how  would  the  board  be accountable    this  is  my  first  apprehension    how  will  all  these  20  institutes  be upgraded  and  taken  as  institutes  of  national  importance    the  educational  parity should  be  there    how  are  we  going  to  do  it    i  think  only  coordination  forum cannot  do  it    everybody  has  said  about  the  students  fees    that  is  also  my apprehension    who  is  going  to  decide  the  fee  structures    the  bill  says  that  the board will be responsible for the fee structure  but the contribution of the central government or whatever budget is there that will be decided by the board  that means the budget should not be same for all 20 institutes and the fee structure will also be different in all these institutes whereas the entrance exam will be same for all  i would like to have some clarification on that
