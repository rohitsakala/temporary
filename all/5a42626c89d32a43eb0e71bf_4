  though  our forefathers traditionally  used  waterways  for  transportation  but    earlier  governments  did  not pay attention during  the last 6065 years period on waterways except five national waterways    fortunately    we  have  at  least  5500  km  long  coastline    there  are numerous perennial rivers in the country  transportation cost through waterways is  relatively  very  low  so  cost  of  commodities  will  also  come  down    this  will decrease  pollution  as  well  as  accidents    i  request  the  government  to  include  the bays in konkan region for transportation through waterways
