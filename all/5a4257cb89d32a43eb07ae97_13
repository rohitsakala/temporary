  i rise to oppose this bill  in order to replace  the  ordinance  a  new  bill  is  introduced  in  this  house  during  this  winter session when an identical bill is still pending in the rajya sabha and the matter is under  the  scrutiny  of  the  standing  committee    coming  to  this  bill  why  i  am opposing this bill is all the enactments or the legislation coming in this house is for ease of doing business  almost all the legislation which is being aggressively pursued by this government is for ease of doing business and not for the common downtrodden  people  of  this  country    can  you  suggest  any  bill  which  is  for  the common  people  of  this  country    the  indirect  way  by  which  the  bill  is  being pushed through or bulldozed through the lok sabha with the huge majority of the government is my first objection  the executive is given ample power to define what is a commercial dispute  even the parliament is not having the authority to define the crux of the legislation  the same things is there for specified value also  chapter v of the bill deals with the transfer of pending suits and application under the arbitration act to the commercial courts  it is also contradictory  there is no definition  as  far  as  the  commercial  courts  or  the  commercial  divisions  or  the commercial appellate tribunals are concerned  the arbitration and conciliation bill  of  2015  is  silent  about  the  definition  of  commercial  dispute    even  this  act also  is  silent  about  the  arbitration  proceedings    what  mechanism  will  be applicable in a case where the specified value is more than rs one crore which is also a commercial dispute  i would like to know whether such a case will be decided by  the  high  court  as  per  the  original  jurisdiction  envisaged  in  the  arbitration  and conciliation  actor  or  it  will  be  done  by  the  commercial  division    the  legislation violates article 14 of the constitution because through this legislative we are creating a classification like poor vs rich  that classification is not a reasonable classification  this means that a poor man will have a poor treatment and the rich will have a better treatment    this  has  to  be  taken  care  of  as  far  as  poor  and  common  people  are concerned  there is haste and hurry so as to pass this bill and this itself means that it is not for the common people of the country and it is only for a particular class of the society  so i strong oppose this bill
