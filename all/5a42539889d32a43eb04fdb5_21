  we  sincerely  support  this budget  but we oppose the defection of peoples representatives after having been elected on a particular party ticket earlier and later defecting to other parties  this is a very immoral practice  we have to correct this  we have a great example of hon vajpayeeji here  had he wished to survive his government he would taken some mps from other parties and would have survived and avoided the midterm poll   but he  never did like  that   here unless  otherwise  we  correct  the  lapses  in our  anti  defection  law  either  it  should  be  a  timebound  thing    within  three months  if  a  person  croses  the  floor  having  been  elected  on  one  partys  to  other party  either  he  should  on  his  own  resign  otherwise  he  should  be  disqualified   this is high time as acted on it
