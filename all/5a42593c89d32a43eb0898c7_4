  this  and  the  forthcoming  bill  on amending  the  iit  act  will  also  introduce  new  institutions  in  andhra  pradesh kerala chhattisgarh goa karnataka jammu and kashmir and there will also be an  upgradation  of  another  institute  in  bihar    what  we  are  looking  is  just  not extending  the  quantity  of  nits  and  nits  throughout  the  country  but  also  the quality    the  issue  of  teacher  shortage  is  extremely  crucial    our  parliamentary committee had also pointed out that there is a tremendous dearth of teachers which is going  to affect the  quality   even the ministrys own  website points out that in the iits there is 39 per cent shortage of teaching staff  in the nits shortage is 29 per cent and in the iiits shortage is 36 per cent  the irony is this that the number of public engineering institutions including the iits and nits are dwarfed by the number of private institutions that have come up in the whole country  about 15 million  to  2  million  engineering  graduates  are  produced  every  year  but employability is very low  the most famous engineer shri e sreedharan blames the  abysmal  quality  of  engineers  on  the  unbridled  growth  of  private  engineering colleges with no regulation  let me point out why the institutes of public sector the nits and the iits are important  the greatest institutes in the world are those that  do  not  treat  teaching  as  a  profitable  entity    some  of  us  had  opportunities  to visit  yale  university  one  of  the  bestknown  universities  in  the  world    we  were impressed  to  learn  that  although  yales  fee  that  they  charge  the  students  is  quite high it only represents 14 per cent of the actual cost of teaching  why is it  that is  because  86  per  cent  of  the  cost  of  teaching  at  yale  is  subsidized  from  the endowments    it  is  a  matter  of  serious  concern  that  most  of  the  engineering graduates churned out by private institutions are not employable   the root cause of  problem  lies  in  the  profitmotive  of  private  institutions  and  also  they  do  not invest in research  it is also worrisome that only 034 per cent of all the students enrolled for higher studies get registered for phd  moreover merely 20 per cent of the ph d students are enrolled in scientific and technological areas  the point i want to lay stress is that we must invest in research  this is what needs to change if  the  quality  of  our  higher  education  particularly  related  to  nits  iits  is  to improve  i do support this bill with the caveats that i have pointed out
