  at the outset i would like to thank the  government  for  bringing  a  bill  which  seeks  to  declare  20  iims  as  the institutions  of  national  importance  and  also  to  empower  those  institutes  to  award degrees  to  the  students    this  will  facilitate  iims  to  become  autonomous institutions prevent government interventions and allow good management to take place    i  am  a  representative  from  bihar  where  a  single  iim  was  set  up  at  bodh gaya in 2015  i would like to urge the government that the number of seats in this institute  should  be  increased  to  300  or  400  like  other  iims    only  three  courses namely finance marketing and hr are being run in this institute  all the courses should be allowed to be offered in the iim bodh gaya  the seats of this institute are not fully filled up and hence this is also required to be taken into account  iim bodh  gaya  is  being  operated  under  the  control  of  iim  kolkata  and  hence  it requires to be made independent  thats why iim bodh gaya should be made selfreliant    even  today  iims  are  reeling  under  the  shortage  of  faculties    so  the vacancy of faculties should be filled up at the earliest  at last i would like to urge the hon minister to set up one more iim at nalanda in bihar
