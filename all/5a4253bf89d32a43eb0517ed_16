 that this bill has been passed with full consensus in the rajya sabha if the same spirit  of    consensus  is  displayed  in  the  lok  sabha  then  bangladesh  would  get  a positive  message  this  may  perhaps  be  the  first  instance  where  a  political discussion  accompanied  some  stirring  melodies  some  members  of  parliament have raised certain questions some have expressed concerns and some have given suggestions all these suggestions would be implemented by the state governments but funds are required for doing so we have provided  funds to the west bengal government  the  question  of  kachchativu  was  raised  the  supreme  court  had given  a  ruling  regarding  berubari  in  which  it  was  set  down  that  constitutional amendment is required for transfer of any land area from india to another country this had happened in the case of kachchativu i would like to inform you that this matter is subjudice and i cannot comment on a subjudice matter but i have noted it  the  matter  of  illegal  infiltration  was  also  raised  88  percent  of  land  has  been fenced  and  fencing  in  the  remaining  area  would  be  done  and  infiltration  will  be checked  after  land  boundary  is  demarcated  as  far  as  maritime  boundary  is concerned  i would like to inform the house that the issue of maritime boundary was  settled  with  bangladesh  on  07  july  2014  the  issue  of  rivers  and  river disputes  is  still  under  discussion  as  regards  the  allegation  of  having  a  big brotherly  attitude  india  does  not  play  the  role  of  a    big  brother  but  of  an  elder brother  with  all its neighbours   which is the  culture of  our country in  the end i would  only  like  to  say  that  if  this  bill  is  passed  here  in  the  same  way  as  it  was passed  in  the  rajya  sabha  with  complete  consensus  it  would  send  a  positive message not only to bangladesh but to the entire world  that there is no political dissent in our country over such issues and all parties think only about the nation and take all decisions keeping in mind  the national interest the bill as amended was passed
