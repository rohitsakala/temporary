 the world health organization in its global estimates on depression for 2015 has said that over five crore indians suffered  from  depression  and  over  three  crore  others  suffered  from  anxiety disorder in that year  this was the calculation or the figure of 2015 alone  is our country equipped to tackle such a burgeoning crisis  the answer is no  there is no  insurance  coverage  for  a  person  with  a  mental  disorder    the  bill  before  us today is no doubt progressive in many ways  it is broader and more inclusive yet this bill received 124 amendments perhaps the highest for any law  readily the government also has accepted those amendments  it prohibits electroconvulsive therapy  in  children  and  makes  it  mandatory  for  medical  experts  to  use  electric shock only under anesthesia for adult patients  this bill guarantees every person the  right  to  access  mental  healthcare  and  treatment  from  the  government    this right  includes  affordable  good  quality  easy  access  to  services  such  as  minimum health services in every district  decriminalization of the attempt to suicide is one of the most outstanding facets of this new bill  this bill provides introduction of advance  directives  to  people  with  mental  health  disorder    it  provides  for establishment of a state mental health authority and the central health authority alongwith  the  mental  health  review  commission  to  regulate  the  sector  and register institutions  this bill requires that every insurance company shall provide medical  insurance  for  the  mental  health  on  the  same  basis  as  it  is  available  for physical  illness    the  bill  ignores  parents  and  families    the  existing  medical infrastructure  is  poor    lack  of  specialists  to  treat  mental  disorders  is  another problem  india has just 01 psychiatrists for one lakh people compared to 17 per one lakh in china  women particularly in rural areas are subjected to great stress in carrying out daily chores and living in a patriarchal oppressive society   there are very few facilities where woman with mental illness can be treated and even fewer who deal with their rehabilitation in society  this bill rightly speaks of not separating  a  mentally  ill  mother  from  her  child  while  she  undergoes  treatment  while the intentions of the bill are laudable much of it will fall through the cracks unless  appropriate  infrastructure  is  set  up    the  union  government  should  give financial help to states to provide mental care services up to district level  society needs to be educated that mental distress disorders and derangement are inevitable byproducts  of  a  stressful  social  order    as  a  society  we  need  to  move  beyond stigma  and  instead  develop  sympathy    the  government  needs  to  invest  more money and health workers in tackling this challenge
