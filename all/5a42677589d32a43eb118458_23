  i  rise  to  support  this  nabard  bill with certain reservations and certain concerns the very purpose of nabard is to boost  the  rural  economy  by  providing  financial  assistance  by  way  of  providing loans  to  three  sectors  namely  agriculture  rural  infrastructure  and  smallscale industries  the  contribution  of  agriculture  to  gdp  has  come  down  from  35  in 1981  to  14  in  2017  the  only  condition  under  wto  agreement  is  that  the subsidy should be to an extent to ten percent but in the country like india where 60  per  cent  of  the  population  is  still  dependent  on  agriculture  unfortunately  that the  component  of  subsidy  is  being  taken  away  so  it  has  to  be  reviewed  and reconsidered  if  the  country  has  to  have  progress  so  if  you  want  to  double  the income to the farmers by 2022 then you have to not only double the lending but also to increase or enhance the capacity of lending of nabard many folds so that agricultural  credit  could  be  provided  to  the  farmers  that  should  be  based  on subsidy  incentives  and  other  benefits  the  second  point  is  regarding  the  rural infrastructure  my  submission  to  the  government  is  that  at  least the  member  of parliament should be informed regarding that rural developmental activities which are being managed funded or financed by the nabard my suggestion regarding to  increase  the  authorised  capital  of  the  bank  under  the  bill  is  that  not  only  the consultation  but  also  the  consent  of  the  reserve  bank  of  india  is  required  my apprehension and concern is that this agricultural development bank is going to be an  industrial  development  bank so kindly  confine  the  activities  of  nabard  to agriculture rural development and small scale industries with rs 1 crore to rs 2 crore and not with rs 10 crore
