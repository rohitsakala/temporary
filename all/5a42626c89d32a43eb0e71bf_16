  while on one hand this bill is certainly going to boost to the trade on the other it will also result in creation of a lot of facilities from the point of view of tourism transportation and protection of environment  i would  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  house  towards  my  constituency    a waterway  has  been  declared  at  point  no  40  which  will  originate  at  faizabad starting from river ghaggar further going through river ganga and reaching upto the confluence of river ghaggar  i would like to request the hon minister that the waterway  which  he  wants  to  start  from  faizabad  should  be  started  from lakhimpur because the construction of a border road along that waterway has been announced  this will pave the way for this national waterway to take the shape of international waterway
