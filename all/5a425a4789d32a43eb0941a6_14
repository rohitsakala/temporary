  as  far  as  issue  of inordinate delay is concerned i would like to place it on record that a letter from the election commission had come to us on 26th november 2015  we processed everything    in  the  present  session  we  are  placing  it  so  that  it  should  be  passed  we had detailed discussions with the election commission of india they said that they may require seven to eight weeks for this purpose  if we are able to pass this bill  we  will  be  able  to  give  them  the  voting  rights  within  the  stipulated  period  central  government  is  certainly  here  to  give  all  sorts  of  assistance  to  the  state government  to  see  that  all  those  persons  who  came  from  bangladesh  should  be rehabilitated  and  should  be  given  all  basic  facilities    there  is  clarity  when  the enclaves are exchanged between the two countries and there is no confusion as far as that matter is concerned  i would therefore request that the bill may kindly be passed  the bill was passed
