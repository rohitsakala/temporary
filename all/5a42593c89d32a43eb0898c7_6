  i  would  like  to  support  the  national institutes  of  technology  science  education  and  research  amendment  bill 2016  the national institute of technology is an institution of national importance which provides  education  of  technology  management science and  its subsidiary subjects  i am of the opinion that the number of seats should be increased in nits  i am also of the opinion that the number of nits should be increased in the state according to their size and population  for instance the population of goa is less than  that  of  my  district  itself  and  there  is  an  nit  whereas  the  population  of maharashtra is more than 11 crore and there is also an nit  this is not justifiable i would  like  to  urge  you  that  an  nit  should  be  set  up  in  marathwada  region    six new nits have been proposed to be set up by the government which is a welcome move    given  the  increasing  interest  of  the  students  in  engineering  and  higher education  the  adequate  steps  will  have  to  be  taken  to  set  up  nits  in  adequate number  in  large  states    moreover  the  condition  of  nit  located  in  northeast needs to be improved  i would also like to draw the attention of the hon minister to  the  increasing  number  of  suicides  committed  by  the  students  in  the  coaching centres of kota  this is a serious issue  proper measures should be taken in this regard
