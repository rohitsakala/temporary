 the issue of price rise should get the priority  over  all  other  issues  because  it  is  affecting  more  than  80  pe  cent  of  our population  i am not doubting the efforts of this government but somehow or the other this government is unable to take any action to rein in inflation  food prices have  increased  to  79  per  cent  in  may  2016  as  against  423  per  cent  in  april  inflation  has  not  a  shortterm  impact    it  will  impact  on  our  employment investment  manufacture  and  our  economy    economic  situation  investment  and employment  will  improve  only  if  banks  extend  credit  and  there  is  investment  consecutively  the  congress  led  government  and  the  bjp  led  government  are unable to control inflation  inflation is a key issues which needs to be tackled  it seems that the government does not have a clue as to what really needs to be done to rein in the prices  instead of focusing on  tackling the supply side glitches that are  chiefly  behind  the  price  spike    the  government  is  holding  the  traders responsible    according  to  the  standing  committee  on  finance  the  information flow  is  not  before  him  and  he  has  to  seek  information  from  different  ministries and has to compile it then there will be very time to fight against the price rise and inflation    moreover  the  presence  of  multiple  agencies  in  handling  various  issue concerning  inflation and  price  rise  reduced  the  department of consumers  affairs to a mere data collecting and compiling organization  the present government has been in power for the last two years and some months but what specific steps has it  taken  to  control  inflation  and  pricerise  than  sending  advisories  to  respective state  governments    the  governments  latest  move  to  take  on  lease  farmlands abroad  mostly  in  african  countries  to  grow  pulses  and  bring  them  to  india  is  an innovative idea no doubt  but i think it needs to come to a logical conclusion  i would only say that the government has miserably failed to provide any relief to the common man  the union government has completely failed to control rising prices  of  essential  commodities  particularly  of  pulses    here  i  would  also  like  to mention that there is a need for more budget allocation for price stabilization fund to  check  prices  of  essential  commodities    incentives  for  pulses  production  will help farmers and consumers both
