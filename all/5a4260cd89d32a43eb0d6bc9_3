 it is nearly 70 years since the country has  got  its  freedom  but  it  is  a  matter  of  regret  that  even  after  so  many  years  the policy of reservation has had little impact on the lives of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes people  these socially deprived people live a precarious life unable  to  still  fulfill  the  bare  necessities  of  life    the  ageold  caste  system  is  the main cause of the social inequalities in our country  although our constitution has provisions  for  reservation  for  these  socially  deprived  people  they  have  benefited from these reservations only in a limited way  we need to put effort to make these people  become  a  part  of  the  mainstream  society    it  is  also  evident  that  with inclusion of more castes under the scheduled caste category the government will require  more  funds to  make  sure that  every  such  member  is  enabled to  access  all opportunities  and  facilities    so  i  request  the  hon  minister  to  revise  the  fund allocation towards the welfare of the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe people  the  time  has  come  to  provide  quality  education  to  our  children  from  the  nursery level as only through education our children can make a good future
