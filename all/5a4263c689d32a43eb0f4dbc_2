 the first point is that the bill proposes to target traffic offenders with stringent penalties  the second point is about creation of the motor  vehicle  accident  fund    under  the  act  the  fund  is  called  the  solatium fund  to  pay  compensation  to  hit  and  run  victims    but  under  the  bill  the government  is  also  creating  one  more  fund  called  the  motor  vehicle  accident fund  so the point is what is the necessary for a second fund when first fund is already there  one other point that i would like to make is regarding the definition of road rage but there is no definition for this in the bill  it would be good to have a  definition  for it   my  final point is that  there are  thousands  of  buses which  are illegally registered with fake addresses and they are given allindia permittourist permit which is not allowed for sleeper coaches  i would request the government to please investigate this and cancel the registration and certificates of these illegal vehicles as it is causing huge safetyrelated issues for the citizens at large
