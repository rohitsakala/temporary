  the country is most concerned regarding research which is  of  very  poor  quality  it  is  not  as  if  students  and  teachers  are  not  good  but  the students passing out of iits and niits either move to civil services or join multinational  companies  we  spend  so  much  billion  dollars  on  arms  purchase  the reason being that  we  fail to  develop technology a  member  referred  to  corpus  in harvard  which  was  created  by  the  private  sector  there    we  need  persons  with hearts like bill gates warren buffet our corporate sector is concerned only with profit the house should discuss as to why the private sector is not contributing in this regard there is no practical orientation in our country here more attention is paid on  pure  science  another  fact is  that those  seeking  admission in mtech  are not  from  btech the  students of  btech  either  go  abroad or join  civil services our research is much lower compared to china and other countries full discussion is needed in this regard we should stop the practice of borrowing technology from abroad the professors are not given the dignity and power due to them they do not get much money also
