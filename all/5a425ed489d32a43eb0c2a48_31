   much has been said about the transparency accountability and about other benefits that will accrue out of gst and all these bills  my  concern  is  regarding  the  two  clauses  of  the  central  gst  bill  that  is clauses 9 and 10 and clause 6 of the integrated gst bill by these provisions of law the powers vested with the state legislatures and the state governments are being taken away the gst council has been empowered with the powers to decide the tax rates the parliamentarians privilege is to deliberate on the tax which is going to be levied on the people that privilege is being taken away by this  act  according  to  article  253  of  the  constitution  it  is  for  the  central government to make legislations without being ratified by the parliament and the state legislatures all these agreements are being implemented as a result of  such  provisions  of  law  the  poor  farmers  especially  the  farmers  who  are growing  cash  crops  are  affected  there  is  no  specific  mention  about  the  cash crops as to under what category it is being treated how can we include all these items under one slab this is not clarified so i urge upon the government to have a relook on this without even amending article 265 of the constitution the powers vested on us are being taken away so for ensuring the benefit of the people  the  government  should  have  a  relook  and  i  hope  there  will  be  some amendments on this issue
