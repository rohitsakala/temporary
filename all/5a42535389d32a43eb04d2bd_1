  the  point  is  a  bill  has  been  passed  by  the  rajya  sabha  and transmitted to this house and that is pending before this house  this bill is titled the  transgender  persons  protection  of  rights  bill  2016  and  the  title  of  the private member bill is the rights of transgender persons 2014  so these two bills are more or less identical are of the same nature and of the same character  so that is my formal objection
