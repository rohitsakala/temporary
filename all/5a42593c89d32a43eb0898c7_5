 five crore people of andhra pradesh  are  suffering  a  lot  due  to  the  unscientific  bifurcation  done  by  the  earlier upa government  i thank the former  hrd minister and prime minister as they have given permission to start 9 institutions out of 11  it is a historical step after independence of this country  i request him to extend all the support  we all know very  well  as  to  how  much  money  is  required  to  build  a  national  institute  of technology  and  javedkarji  is  providing  rs40  crore  for  this  institute    i  would request  the  hon  hrd  minister  to  create  the  entire  infrastructure  for  the  national institute of technology tadepalligudam before the completion of the first batch  i would  also  like  to  request  the  government  of  india  to  provide  more  and  more funds  to  higher  education  in  our  country  because  providing  education  is  the responsibility of the government  the iits and nits are not only suffereing from the  shortage  of  teachers  but  also  from  the  shortage  of  fund    besides  the  most important  thing  is  research  where  we  have  cut  a  sorry  figure  for  a  number  of reasons    for  that  we  would  have  to  create  a  worldclass  environment  in  our education institutions  besides we should maintain the holistic atmosphere in our educational institutions  then only we would be able to provide quality education to the students  the industrialization is not increasing in proportion to the increase in the engineering graduates  so i would request that we should concentrate more in  bringing  industrialization  on  par  with  education    only  then  we  would  be  in position  to  provide  more  and  more  jobs  to  our  engineering  graduates  and  other graduates  at the same time i would also request the hon minister to increase the budgetary allocation in this regard
