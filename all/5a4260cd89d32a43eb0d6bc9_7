 my first demand is to increase the percentage of reservation for the people belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in proportion to their  population   it should  be  increased  from  15 to 20 or 22 per cent in proportion to their population through a constitution amendment  of late there is a tendency on the part of everyone to subclassify them and subcategorise them  it is being done maybe for reasons of political benefit or maybe for some other benefit  there are a lot of hostility  towards people belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes  there are no secretaries and joint secretaries in the government of india from the people belonging to scheduled castes community  there are no judges in the judiciary from the scheduled castes community  there are so many judgments coming from the supreme court against reservation  there is  an  urgent  need  to  revisit  and  relook  at  the  entire  reservation  policy  in  the country  we have to seek justice for the people belonging to the scheduled castes and  scheduled  tribes  once  for  all    it  is  because  we  are  striving  for  national integration
