 long back in 1951 when the patiala government for the first time saw promulgation of article 356  at the outset i would  categorically  put  it  on  record  very  clearly  that  all  these  are  regressive  and bad precedents that we are setting  as a representative of an established regional party i oppose this imposition of article 356  india is in a situation where both the bjpled  nda  and  the  congressled  upa  seem  to  be  in  the  same  boat  and  both seem to be repeating each other  i believe the constitution is a piece of paper  it is to  be  used  for the interest of the  people  it is not  to be  misused  for our personal and  political  goals    we  have  heard  about  cooperative  federalism  from  this government  we all hoped that a new chapter would begin  so this cooperative federalism  has  become  a  doubtful  slogan  now  a  slogan  that  is  intended  for  use when  it  is  convenient    what  the  bjpled  nda  government  has  done  till  now starting  from  arunachal  pradesh  to  uttarakhand  is  not  only  antidemocratic  and antifederalism  but  also  a  very  sad  thing  because  all  of  us  pin  a  lot  of  hope  on narendra  damodar  das  modi  ji  and  his  government    a  floor  test  is  the  natural recourse if questions of stability of a government are concerned
