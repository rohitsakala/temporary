  in  our  country  it  has  become  a common  trend  to  buy  properties  make  transactions  dabble  in  shares  purchase vehicle through benami transactions  in some of the cases property is immediately transferred  by  a  person  in  the  name  of  any  member  of  his  family    it  is  only  to hoodwink the government  i would like to compliment the government that it has endeavour  for  making  this  bill  more  stringent  by  bringing  in  comprehensive amendments  in  the  benami  transactions  prohibition  act  1988    most  of  the black  money  is  invested  in  the  real  estate  sector    i  would  like  to  bring  to  the cognizance  of  the  government    that  there  is  a  provision  in  this  bill  that  right  to confiscate  any  type  of  property  will  vest  with  the  central  government  whereas land  and  property  are  state  subjects    so  there  is  a  need  to  rope  in  the  state governments  in  this  whole  process    no  time  limit  has  been  provided  regarding filing of appeal by any person in appellate tribunals  there should be atleast three months window for approaching the high court in this regard  i do not feel that mere by making provisions  for six months jail and 25 per cent penalty will make this  act  stringent    government  should  have  absolute  rights  over  confiscated property    inquiry  should  also  be  made  with  regard  to  the  high  officials  and  the subordinate staff who have attained superannuation    shri  c  n  jayadevan  the  benami  transactions  prohibition amendment bill 2015 has been brought by making comprehensive amendments to the  benami  transactions  prohibition  act  1988  and  to  deal  with  benami transactions effectively  we know that many of the politicians and bureaucrats in the  country  are  amassing  property  worth  more  than  their  legal  income  in  benami names    i  think  this  bill  will  help  to  check  this  menace  to  a  great  extent  if implemented  properly    the  committee  had  also  noted  that  benami  transactions could  be  preempted  and  eliminated  by  digitalization  of  land  records    the committee  stated  that  since  land  is  a  state  subject  under  the  constitution  rights over confiscated properties should vest with the state governments instead of the central government  so i would like to know what is the governments reaction to these issues    shri ck sangma the first point that i would like to say is that unless and until there is proper coordination between the centre and the state it  will be difficult for this act to be actually implemented at the grass root level  second we are  a  sixth  schedule  area    being  a  sixth  schedule  area  the  land  belongs  to  the clan the land belongs to the headman  the land does not belong to any individual  in this particular act there is no provision to allow the clan to be exempted from this law  i think in north east most of the tribals are exempted from income tax  it is a wonderful scenario for anybody who wants to do benami  therefore these kinds  of  situations  need  to  be  considered  when  we  pass  this  bill    another important  issue  is  that  we  have  porous  borders  with  bangladesh    a  lot  of counterfeit  money  is  coming  in    all  i  am  saying  is  that  the  central  government must respect the sentiments of the tribal people and at the same time ensure that the act is implemented in true spirit  the last point which i would like to mention is that  the  government  must  make  some  provisions to ensure that the powers  are not misutilized under this act
