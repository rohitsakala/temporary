  during the last 18 months rapid progress has been achieved in the department of atomic energy and also in the field of atomic energy  at present we have got 21 reactors and  very  soon  we  will  add  up  six  more  reactors    just  two  days  back  we  have finalised an mou with japan  in the years to come nuclear power in india is set to become one of the major source of energy and also electricity  the atomic energy act of india was enacted in 1962 with rapid expansion of our nuclear programme we  have  two  main  constraints  coming  forward    the  act  makes  it  binding  on  us that  all  the  future  reactors  or  future  establishments  have  to  be  set  up  by  these corporations  secondly the financial constraints on the part of these corporations also  make  it  difficult  to  proceed  forward    therefore  keeping  these  two consideration  we  can  have  a  provision  of  a  joint  venture  with  other  government establishments  including  psus    but  the  atomic  energy  act  of  1962  debars  us from  entering  into  any  kind  of  a  joint  venture    so  one  of  the  amendments  is pertaining to that  in the 1962 act the government company is defined as the one which has a share of not less than 51 per cent  when we enter into a joint venture we might sometimes have a company which may not be having that much of share because it would be always be a government company or a government sector unit  therefore we have tried to bring in an amendment so as to make an provision that this will be 51 per cent jointly  the need for this has arisen to meet the immediate need  of  equity  infusion  to  augment  countrys  nuclear  power  generation  capacity   the present constraint is that currently the atomic energy act narrowly defines the category  of  companies  eligible  for  licence  to  produce  nuclear  power    the definition of the government company is the one not less than 51 per cent of paid up shares in the capital held by the central government   if in future that company does not remain in government sector for any reasons then government would have the right to cancel the licence
