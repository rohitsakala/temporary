  out  of  rs21  lakh  crores  of union  budget  only  rs60000  crore  has  been  allocated  for  the  ministry  of agriculture  which  seems  to  be  on  lower  side    this  amounts  to  3  per  cent  only though 70 per cent of our population depends on agriculture  i would like to say that the government should conceive a new programme called grow india on the lines with programmes such as makeinindia digital india skill india etc and a target  should  be  fixed  for  this  new  programme  also    the  government  has  set  a target to double the income of farmers but i would seek some clarifications about it    i  understand  that  their  profitability  should  be  doubled    the  report  of  dr swaminathan  should  be  implemented    i  strongly  believe  that  till  the  msp  is  not fixed  50  per  cent  more  than  the  input  cost  the  farmers  cannot  survive    the government  should  clarify  in  this  regard    i  would  like  to  congratulate  the  modi government  for  introduction  of  neem  coated  urea  which  has  saved  the  farmers  the subsidy  for drip irrigation should be  increased   the crop insurance  scheme introduced by  the  government  has  benefited  the  farmers   its  coverage  target  has been  fixed  at  50  per  cent  but  i  would  like  that  it  should  be  100  per  cent    soil health  cards  is  a  good  scheme      there  are  about  650  vigyan  kendras  or laboratories but i would say that this number is inadequate  this government has given  due  emphasis  on  irrigation  and  has  increased  the  budget  from  rs20000 crore to rs40000  crore  there are about 20 check dams in punjab but all of them are  not  functional  as  the  silt  has  accumulated  there    when  the  state  government intend  to  desilt  them  the  department  of  mining  stopped  them    therefore something  should  be  done  in  this  regard   a  basmati  trade  corporation  should  be set  up    agro  based  industry  should  be  reserved  for  farmers    there  is  no  proper arrangement for checking the wastage of foodgrains  therefore storages should be set  up    today  the  loans  of  farmers  need  to  be  waived  off    the  ministries  of consumer affairs food and irrigation should be merged with the union ministry of agriculture  a separate budget should be presented for agriculture
