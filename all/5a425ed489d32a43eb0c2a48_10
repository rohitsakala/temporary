  the  government  may  enact  as many  legislations  as  it  wants  but  the  nation  will  not  be  prosperous  unless  the welfare  of  farmer  community  is  taken  care  of      the  government  should  also enact such laws that no one is forced to commit suicide due to starvation or debt burden    the  government  has  promised  to  provide  employment  to  the unemployed  but    it  is  not  clear  when  it  is  going  to  fulfill  its  promise    i  think breaking  of  promise  is  also  a  sort  of  corruption    the  people  have  great expectations  from  this  government  and  i  hope  that  this  government  would provide jobs to all the unemployed youth and would not indulge in any sort of discrimination  against  anybody    it  should  also  bring  its  proposals  for  the betterment  of  the  poor  labourers  farmers  and  women    finally  i  believe  that the government would fulfill all the promises it has made to the people of the country
