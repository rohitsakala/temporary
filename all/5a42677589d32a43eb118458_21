  i  would  like  to  put  forward  a  few  humble  demands  of mine to the central government as we all are aware the rainy season is going on now  so  seeds  should  be  given  to  the  farmers  during  this  season  secondly fertilizers should be given to the poor farmers thirdly loans which were already given to the poor farmers should be waived
