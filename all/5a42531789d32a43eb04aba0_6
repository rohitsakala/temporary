  it  is  really  a  matter  of  pride  that  our  defence establishments jawans of our country are not only protecting the life and property of 125 crore countrymen but also people of our neighbouring countries  our hon defence minister has plugged the loopholes in defence department and hence has enhanced  the honour  of our  country    in  the  year  2011 some  officers of  defence department arbitrarily brought out an illegal  bogus and fake circular to harass the people  of  this  country    in  order  to  protest  against  this  circular  the  people approached  court  and  the  court  took  the  matter  very  seriously  and  cleared  the matter  to  a  great  extent    i  believe  that  whether  it  is  a  defence  minister  or  three wings of our army or defence secretaries are all part of a same system  but these days navy officers do not follow the circular brought out by defence secretary as they have brought out their own circular and have withhold the construction work in the mumbai city  i would like to state here that at least 22 people have booked their  flats  in  a  building  being  constructed  in  mulund  ghatkopar  and  lbs  road  these  people  have  made  their  investment  in  this  construction  of  building  but  the officers of navy have brought out a circular due to which the construction has been stopped    i  would  request  the  defence  minister  to  take  up  this  matter  seriously because the people engaged in building construction work has a major contribution in the gdp of our country  besides it provides employment to crores of people the discussion was not concluded
