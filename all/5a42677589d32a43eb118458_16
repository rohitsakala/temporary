  i am extremely  grateful to you for allowing me to speak on the national bank for agriculture and rural development amendment bill 2017  the bill proposes to increase authroised capital of nabard from rs 5000  crore  to  rs  30000  crore    such  move  reflects  the  conviction  and commitment of the government towards villages and agriculture sector one of the major  problems  being  faced  by  farmers  today  is  related  to  market  if  we  provide storage  facility  to  farmers  for  their  perishable  and  nonperishable  produces  at panchayat  level  through  nabard  then  major  problems  of  farmers  would  be solved  nabard has made great contribution in the field of irrigation nabard has played a major role in setting up of check dam and barrage while supporting the bill i would say that special attention needs to be paid towards its monitoring and assets creation
