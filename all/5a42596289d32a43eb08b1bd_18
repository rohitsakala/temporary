  i  congratulate  the  hon  minister  for having  such  a  comprehensive  bill  after  detailed  discussion  in  the  standing committee  in  rajya  sabha  and  also  in  this  house    globally  there  are  367 million  people  who  are  living  with  hiv    india  has  third  largest  population  of people  living  with  hiv  with  an  estimated  21  lakh  people  after  south  africa  and nigeria  it is satisfying to note that the national hiv epidemic has declined over the last 15 years or so  we hope this bill will give further boost to indias efforts in  fulfilling  the  global  commitments  towards  ending  the  aids  epidemic  by  the year 2030  people living with hiv are still dying in our country particularly when coinfected  with  tb  or  hepatitisc  even  when  we  have  knowledge  and  means  to prevent  such  deaths    the  bill  says  that  the  central  government  and  the  state governments  may  try  their  level  best  to  give  measures  for  providing  antiretroviral drugs as far as possible  our suggestion is that as far as possible may be  deleted  and  a  specific  assurance  may  be  given  in  this  house    india  supplies more than 80 per cent of the antiretroviral medicines globally but it seems to be hesitating in committing to provide treatment to its own citizens  even with all the years of awareness and education we have instances of stigma and discrimination against  people  living  with  hiv    these  are  the  challenges  we  must  particularly have  in  mind  while  making  rules  in  this  regard    the  discrimination  is  also  well addressed in this bill  i fully support this bill
