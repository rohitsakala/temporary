  i  rise  to  support  this  bill    right  to free  and  compulsory  education  to  all  children  below  the  age  of  14  years  is  a constitutional obligation  it was a revolutionary change which took place in 2002  article 21 is amended in order to incorporate 21 a in the constitution to provide right to free and compulsory education to all children between the ages of six and fourteen   but  unfortunately  that  act  came  into  force  only  in  the  year  2009   my first suggestion to the hon minister is to have a discussion on the implementation of the rte act  that is the need of the hour  by 31st march 2015 every teacher in the primary school should possess the minimum and basic qualification  now the government is extending the date of 31st march 2019  article 21 is violated by the respective state governments  the respective state governments are not able to train the trainers within the stipulated time of 31st december 2015 means they have violated the fundamental right of the citizens of those states  i would like to know  from  the  hon  minister  as  to  which  are  the  states  that  have  compiled  with article  21a  and  which  are  the  states  that  have  demanded  or  sought  exemption from this provision  there are totally 66 lakh primary teachers  out of which 11 lakh teachers are still untrained  that means the right to education act is only on paper  and  not  in  practice    quantity  quality  and  equality  have  to  be  improved  in education  the point is the gdp contribution to education has to be increased to six per cent
