  there  are  delicate  fault  lines  in  our society  like  this  where  after  69  years  of  independence  we  have  people  who  are enslaved  in  large  sections  by  poverty  social  inequality  and  bound  together  by  a need for survival  child labour is one such reality  there are different definitions given to the term child labour  we need to look into this and align this with right to  education  as  well  which  this  bill  has  attempted  to  do    we  have  the  largest amount of child labour in the world  nongovernment statistics say that we have 30  million  children  in  child  labour  and  15  million  of  them  are  bonded  labour which  is  even  more  severe    the  reasons  are  very  obvious    it  is  poverty  due  to which  the  need  for  an  extra  income  arises    the  fact  is  that  80  per  cent  of  these children  are  working  in  rural  areas  as  agriculture  labour    this  bill  looks  at  the distinction between a child and an adolescent  it also balances the need for basic education with the need for an extra income  it also aligns itself with other laws  it  also  increases  the  punishment  for  somebody  who  hires  children    this  bills prohibits  all  forms  of  child  labour  with  the  exception  of  children  who  are  aiding their  families  in  nonhazardous  occupations  after  school  or  during  vacation    in india we have unorganized occupations where people pass on their skills to their children  however this bill has not clarified one thing completely which is 70 per cent  of  our  children  work  as  an  aid  in  the  contractual  labour  with  their  parents which is actually bonded labour  the bill gives the power to the government for omitting  processes  from  schedules    this  can  be  misused    so  this  needs  to  be looked into  rather than giving power to the government for omitting processes from  schedules  a  parliamentary  clearance  for  the  same  would  be  a  better safeguard    there  is  a  need  to  make  this  bill  in  sync  with  the  rte  act  and  the bonded  labour  rules    then  i  come  to  strengthening  of  the  inspection  process  the  bill  says  that  appropriate  inspection  should  be  done  where  employment  of children  are  prohibited    but  the  monitoring  needs  to  be  extended  to  adolescents which are working in nonhazardous places because a child is working against his will even in places where he is allowed to work  we still have a system where we do  not  train  our  children  for  employment    how  on  earth  are  we  going  to  move forward as a country  shri akshay yadav a country cannot make progress where future of children  is  not  secured    united  nations  child  rights  protocol  and  the  138th convention of the international labour organisation considers the age of a child as 18  years    in  such  a  situation  what  was  the  need  to  reduce  the  age  of  a  child  children of age from 14 to 18 years are the maximum victim of trafficking  this bill is going to give impetus to human trafficking  we should find ways to provide better  education  to  the  children  of  the  age  of  upto  18  years    right  to  education should  be  given  to  children  of  the  age  of  upto  18  years  instead  of  14  years  aadhaar  cards  should  be  made  compulsory  for  the  school  admission    school dropouts also need attention  it is not proper if the children work in the  name of family enterprises  the government should enact a law whereby we can provide freedom of studies to our children  child labour are not paid at full rate of wages  this also is a sort of generating black money
