 i  appreciate the  government for introducing the iim bill 2017 which will address a long pending demand of the academia to give degreegranting power to the iims and also give them academic freedom in pursuit of excellence  i am happy to note that the new bill will address most of the autonomyrelated concerns of iim fraternity and it will make each of the 20 iims an institute of national importance  it is good to note that the institutes will  be  managed  by  an  independent  board  and  each  will  have  a  chairperson  and director which will be selected by the board instead of the government   i think the new bill should incorporate some provisions where iiims will be engaged as a management think tank for the local governments  iims can also be used as hubs to train plan monitor and help management of social service initiatives  the iim extension centres will make iims knowledge resources accessible to sustain and enhance the quality of human life for the local communities
