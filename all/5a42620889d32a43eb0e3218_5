  the  child  labour  prohibition  and regulation amendment bill 2012 is one of the most ill prepared bill that i have seen in my seven years in parliament  this bill neither prohibits child labour nor does  it  regulate  child  labour    by  allowing  clause  5  the  government  is  actually legitimizing the use of child labour albeit in a manner of family enterprises   the use of family has also been expanded  by allowing this provision the government have  now  blocked  the  hands  of  civil  society  from  acting  on  saving  children  who are  forced  into  labour    there  is  no  clause  which  regulates  the  working environment  we are saying the family which has been forced to send his children to some work needs to be punished  the fact is that they do not have the money to begin  with  and  that  is  the  reason  they  are  forcing  their  children  to  work  whether hazardous or not  if the government take  fine from them if you put the father the earning member in jail the government think the children will stop working  do not  be  in  a  hurry  to  pass  this  bill  do  not  reduce  the  list  of  hazardous  industries from 83 to 3 follow the norms of the ilo  send this bill to a select committee  let  the  house  examine  it  correctly  let  there  be  a  wider  consultation  in  this process
