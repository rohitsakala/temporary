    the  bill  seeks  to  amend  the  national  bank  for agriculture  and  rural  development  act  1981    the  commercial  banks  provide almost three fourth of the total agricultural credit in the country and the regional rural  banks  provide  another  ten  percent    the  major  portion  of  this  credit  is financed by nabard but most of these agricultural advances had not reached the needy  farmers  and  is  siphoned  off    by  the  middle  class  people  for  consumption rather than agricultural purposes  reason being concentration of commercial bank branches  in  urban  and  semi  urban  areas    the  quantum  of  agriculture  advance released to farmers proves that the real farmers are denied low cost credit  out of the  total  bank  advances  commercial  banks  have  contributed  72  per  cent  the regional rural banks 11 per cent and the cooperative banks 17 per cent  the rbi and  nabard  should  be  directed  to  create  a  foolproof  mechanism  by  which  the entire  advance  at  low  cost  is  distributed  or  channelised  to  the  farmers  through  a local level service cooperative bank   the rbi is to ensure that the public deposits in  such  local  cooperative  banks  are  safe    its  liquidity  should  be  assured  by nabard  and  rbi  and  the  administrative  control  which  may  be  vested  with  the states      the  state  cooperative  sector  its  administration  audit  and  enforcement need  to  be  totally  overhauled    the  present  lethargic  bureaucracy  be  totally abolished  and  a  pure  banking  based  management  and  administration  of  primary cooperative bank be evolved by nabard   shri  ck  sangma    i  stand  to  support  this  bill    the  objectives  of nabard are very positive the slogan is very positive and entrepreneurship is the way forward  we do not have the information in most of the locations on what the growth of agriculture has been because of the increase and implementation of these irrigation  schemes    i  suggest  to  the  hon  ministry  of  agriculture  as  well  as  the ministry  of  finance  that  we  should  have  a  centralized  data  bank  that  actually oversees the change in the production after these irrigation projects are done the northeast has a huge potential when it comes to dairy industry  but sadly in the last few years the northeast has not even received about rs 20 crore in terms of these  investments  and  my  state  has  not  even  touched  rs  5  crore    so  with  the huge  international  borders  that  we  have  almost  4000  plus  kilometers  of  border the potential that we have to export even milk i think is huge  that will help the farmers  and  the  people  who  are  raising  these  cattle  also    i  think  this  potential should  be  looked  into  and  more  attention  should  be  paid  to  this  particular  sector  most of the northeast region that we have is very rich in vegetables and very rich in horticulture products but sadly there is no value addition could i also get some kind  of  assurance  from  the  ministry  and  from  the  hon  minister  that  food processing  also  would  be  given  equal  importance  just  like  the  irrigation  and  the dairy farming is being given  if food processing comes in then it will go with the idea of nabard which is gaon bade to desh bade
