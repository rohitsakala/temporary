  i  am  really  overwhelmed with  the  support  and  the  quality  of  discussion  we  had  on  these  two  bills    all  are endowed with wisdom but they should be provided opportunity  when opportunity is given their capability comes to the fore  therefore it is duty of the society to provide equal  opportunity    so  those  four  points  have  become  five  points  accessibility quality  affordability  accountability  and  equality    all  these  together  is  what  will make education  today the government incurs rs6 lakh expenditure per student per year  but everyone is not affluent therefore we have to have a graded fee structure  the maximum fee is rs rs2 lakh  it is a complete fee waiver for scheduled tribes and scheduled castes so 23 per cent is covered in that  the people who are earning below  rs1akh  and  physically  handicapped  who  are  talented  they  are  also  having  a complete fee waiver  upto rs5 lakh income they have to pay only rs60000  upto rs9 lakh annual income they will be provided interest free loan and interest free loan means repayment is paid over a period of ten years so they will be given much more than  we  actually  charge    so  major  poor  section  is  completely  covered  through various schemes  we are charging rs2 lakh from the affluent section of the society  those who are capable to pay must pay the fees  again let me put emphasis on the infrastructure    infrastructure  is  not  just  roads  buildings  or  staff  quarters    that  is important    but  more  important  is  research  infrastructure  and  there  is  tremendous backlog    now  all  of  us  together  have  to  do  it    we  have  thought  of  a  higher education financial agency hefa  with budgeted rs1000 crore commitment we  will  apoint  one  partner  in  bank  and  somebody  else  a  financial  institute  to manage it  it will also put in rs1000 crore with that rs2000 crore basic core capital  we  will  leverage  rs20000  crore  for  improving  the  infrastructure throughout  the  iits  and  nits    this  amount  of  rs20000  crore  is  coming  in  the next three years  so on the infrastructure backlog we have already asked all the iits and nits to give us the dprs  so when we sanction the money they should be  ready  with  their  dprs  so  that  the  work  can  start  immediately    many  people talked about that before even coming to the iits the students have to spend lakhs of rupees on coaching  but there also we are coming with a very innovative idea of iitpal  iitpal is a free open course which is available online  i want to make it  available  through  the  tv  also    those  interested  students  need  not  go  to  the coaching  centres  but  can  take  lessons  materials  homework  tutorial  trial examination  and  everything  here everything  what  a  coaching centre  does it  will be  much  better  and  it  is  done  by  the  best  of  the  professors  of  india    that  is  the major initiative which come for all the students  everybody talked about research  we need more new research  we call ourselves as it superpower  but we are not producing  hardware    but  even  in  software  we  have  not  come  out  with  new google    so  there  are  many  things  even  in  software    though  india  youths  have made  significant  contribution  in  innovations  like  google  face  book  and  twitter etc  these  innovations  is  not  in  our  name  the  number  of  total  research publications is 25164   your young scientists have filed 757 patents and of them patents awarded are 137  our capacity is such that we can do ten times more  we are providing at least from rs1 crore to rs5 crore for each research proposal as per requirement  they need our talented youths not go to foreign countries india will  provide  them  the  required  finance    that  is  the  initiative  of  our  hon  prime minister under imprint india  everybody stressed on iitindustry interaction  the uchchatar avishakar yojana was stated in 2015 and we are continuing to improve it further  so there are nearly 500  projects under imprint india and 100 projects under  uchchatar  avishkar  yojana  will  be  taken up which  will  really  start  a new innings for research and innovation in india  under startup we have allowed the iit  hostels  to  start  it  even  in  their  hostel  rooms    so  under  startup  we  are providing  facilities  finance  and  escort  services    we  have  started  an  initiative named  gyan  ie  global  initiative  of  academic  network    more  than  200 professors from all over the world best of the best teachers have come over here conducted the course and have benefited thousands of students  then swayam is a big launch to happen  team comprising five each expert professors of all main courses  and  subjects  for  teaching  students  from  ninth  standard  to  post  graduate level  have  been  constituted    it  will  give  a  new  dimension  to  education  as  good education  for  all  is  the  policy  of  this  government  and  this  government  is marching  ahead  with  this  goal  in  view      therefore  under  national  knowledge network  600  universities  and  institutions  of  national  importance  have  been connected  with  one  gbps  connectivity  provided  there  is  a  platform  for collaborative  learning  and  access  to  high  speed  internet    apart  from  this  all  the central universities in the country are going to be connected through wifi network  under  this  all  the  classrooms  libraries  laboratories  hostels  and  places frequented  by  students  even  canteen  will  be  covered  by  wifi    all  these experiments are increasing the quality of education  one of the hon members has raised  an  important  issue  like  interaction  with  defence  and  space  research organization  this opportunity should be provided to the students  i have noted down  suggestions  of  all  the  hon  members    and  we  will  all  together  take  a decision thereon as providing good education is the duty of all of us  this is also a national agenda too and we will all carry it forward  finally i am thankful to all the hon members for extending their support to this bill the bill as amended was passed
