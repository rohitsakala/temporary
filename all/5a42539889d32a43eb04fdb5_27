  i  feel  sad  whatever  happened  in uttarakhand and arunachal pradesh it is also a matter of concern that comments are  passed  on  the  highest  authority  of  the  country  today  i  urge  upon  the government  that  they  will  have  to  think  over  judiciary  as  well  the  people belonging to media write anything against the government today judges pass such comment that become the highlights of the newspaper and television this does not augur  well  for  democracy  so  we  will  have  to  discuss  on  the  amendment  of  the provision of emergency we will also have to take cognizance of the fact the way bjp  has  destabilised  the  democracy  in  two  states  therefore  i  am  of  the  opinion that we must discuss on the provision of article 356 once again
