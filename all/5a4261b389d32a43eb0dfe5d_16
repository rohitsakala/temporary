  i  congratulate  both  the  governments the  upa  government  and the  nda  government  for  bringing  such  a comprehensive bill to protect and promote the interests of persons having mental disorder this is a perfect legislation  it is surprising to know that in india six to seven per cent of the population is suffering from mental illness  but the medical infrastructure available to address to address mental illness is very poor  as result over 50 per cent of the mentally ill persons in india do not have access to mental healthcare  so  mental  healthcare  social  stigma  and  discrimination  and  also rehabilitation are aspects which are well addressed in the mental healthcare bill 2016    i  am  now  coming  to  the  provisions  of  the  bill    i  would  like  to  seek  a clarification  from  the  hon  minister  whether  we  will  be  able  to  implement  the mental  health  care  as  stipulated  in  clauses  21o  of  the  bill    given  the  wider scope  of  the  definition  of  mental  illness  as  enumerated  in  clauses  21s  of  the bill  i  would  also  like  to  ask  whether  the  government  with  the  limited  existing infrastructure  would  be  able  to  implement  these  provisions  in  practice    i  would appreciate the hon minister as  well as the government regarding section 309 of the  india  penal  code  that  is  decriminalization  of  the  attempt  to  commit  suicide which is provided in clause 115 of the bill  it is a very progressive and a logical provision regarding  suicide it  is very  interesting to  note  that  in india  suicide is one among the top ten causes of death  that is why the law commission in its 210th report had recommended and suggested for decriminalization of attempt to commit  suicide  i  have  moved  13  amendments  which  will  help  the  government and make the provisions more clear  i fully and wholeheartedly support this bill
