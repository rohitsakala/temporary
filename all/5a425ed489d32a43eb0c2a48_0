 these are four important bills and are being taken up together for consideration as their subject matters and references are same  the system of indirect taxes extant anterior to 101st amendment  to  the  constitution  continues  to  exist  even  today  and  is  likely  to continue till 15th september this year  under this system the right to levy some of the taxes was the jurisdiction of the centre and the right to levy some of other taxes  was  under  the  jurisdiction  of  states    but  these  bills  seek  to  ensure  the movement of all the goods and services all over india to set up uniform system of  taxation  facilitate  the  interface  of  an  assessee  with  only  one  assessee authority  the tax proceeds so collected will be shared by both the centre and the  states    this  system  is  somewhat  different  from  the  earlier  one    it  is different because we are now creating by law a jurisdiction simultaneously both in  the  centre  and  the  states  and  in  the  process  handing  over  the  indirect  tax administration  to  the  first  federal  institution  that  india  has  created  where  the centre  and  the  states  both  will  participate    in  this  respect  the  goods  and services  tax  council  made  unanimous  recommendations  for  five  laws  out  of which  four  laws  will  come  up  before  the  parliament  and  one  before  the legislative  assemblies  of  all  the  states  and  two  union  territories  where legislative  assembly  exists    first  law  is  the  central  gst  law  which  includes the  integration  of  taxes  to  be  incurred  on  goods  and  services  determine  the ceiling  of  taxation  and  collection  of  taxes  etc    second  law  is  the  sgst  law which will not come up before the centre but before 31 legislative assemblies  this  law  will  be  a  mirror  image  of  the  central  law  and  will provide  for  as to how  the  gst  will  be  implemented  in  every  state   third  law  is  the  integrated gst  which  will  handle  the  taxes  likely  to  be  incurred  on  the  transactions  of interstate trades from one state to another state and from one union territory to the other union territory  fourth is the union territory gst law which in a way stands to be the cgst law as it incorporates its provisions and implement them  in  the  union  territories    fifth  and  the  last  one  deals  with  the  system under  which  provisions  have  been  made  to  provide  compensation  to  the  state which suffers loss as a result of its implementation  a provision has been made for  compensation  cess  in  order  to  provide  for  compensation  to  such  states which includes tax exceeding 28 per cent on the luxury items   apart from this the  gst  council  is  indias  first  federal  institution  where  sovereignty  of  the centre and the states in relation to indirect taxes has been pooled together in a federal  institution    hence  to  create  indias  first  federal  institution  it  is incumbent  on  all  of  us  to  make  sure  that  the  federal  institution  works  therefore  i  hope  we  are  guided  to  maintain  that  delicate  balance  of  that relationship  itself    with  these  few  words  i  commend  these  laws  for  the consideration of the house
