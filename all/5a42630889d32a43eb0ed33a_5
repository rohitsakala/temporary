    i  support  this  bill    although  this  bill  is  about iiits  it  concerns  higher  education    everyone  demands  iits  iims  iiits  and institutes  of  higher  education  but  nobody  talks  about  the  quality  of  education  we have entrance tests but not exit tests  the amount of money being wasted because of  inferior  teaching  and  training  levels  is  mindboggling    corporations  would  save much  if  the  passouts  are  effective  and  readily  employable    that  will  definitely benefit the indian economy immediately  this bill appears to be a step in the right direction  by allowing industry participation in management of iits we will ensure that the right kind of exposure is provided to students before they pass out  the bill proposes a ratio of 503515 for the central state and private investors respectively  it would be better if this set of ratio is not  mentioned in the law but issued through regulations  after  the  law  is  passed    it  would  be  beneficial  because  then  the government  can  moderate  the  share  of  each  parties  according  to  the  conditions prevalent  in  future    teacher  recruitment  is  becoming  a  serious  problem  in  higher education  institutes  the  pay  for  the  teaching  jobs  needs  to  be  increased  and  made more and more attractive to encourage passing out students to take up teaching jobs  regional  languages  should  be  promoted  in  these  institutes  it  would  go  a  long  way towards attracting local talent  indias strength is in its diversity and language plays a big role
