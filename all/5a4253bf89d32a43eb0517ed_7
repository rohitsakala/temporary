 whenever we talk about bangladesh we always get  reminded  of  bengal  partition 1906  and  annulment  of  bengal  partition 1911  from this the greatest lesson the british learnt was that they could not divide the bengal  people    then  they  shifted  their  capital  to  delhi  and  afterwards  pakistan was created from india  when we look at the map it is very surprising to see how bangladesh can be a part of pakistan which is situated on the other side of india and  ultimately  bangladesh  was  created  in  1971    i  request  the  hon  minister  to look into the issues between sri lanka and tamil nadu and to facilitate free trade so as to  benefit the  people of both sides  we on  behalf of  telugu  desam  party fully support this bill
