 an amendment was actually effected in 2015 where substantive amendments were made and we had certain reservations regarding  those  amendments    so  again  some  amendments  have  been  proposed  when the amendment was given effect to last year the general perception that was created by this government was that now once the central government comes into operation they  will  be  auctioning  all  the  mines  more  transparency  will  be  there more  money will accrue and that money will also be transferred to the respective states    but  around  six  or  seven  states  had  certain  reservations  that  since  land belongs to the state whenever any lease has to be given whenever any mining is to  be  given  as  prospective  license  or  mining  lease  then  the  state  has  to  be  taken into  confidence      there  were  at  least  three  rulings  from  the  supreme  court  that had  established  that  the  state  governments  had  rights  over  mines  as  well  as  the lands  on  which  the  mines  were  located    our  party  agrees  with  the  proposed amendment  which  would  facilitate  transfer  of  captive  leases  alongwith  the respective end user industry  i would like to impress upon the minister that when the  lease  is  granted  by  the  state  government  its  transfer  should  also  be permissible  with  the  permission  of  the  respective  state  government  and  not otherwise    the  governments  should  not  ignore  the  state  government  because ultimately  it  is  with  the  help  of  the  state  government  that  mining  can  happen actually  the central government may also consider incorporating a provision to empower  the  state  government  to  permit  transfer  of  a  mining  lease  from  one government  company  to  another    the  amendment  provision  of  section  61b regarding  area  limit  is  causing  difficulties  in  increasing  the  limit  on  case  to  case basis  why  case  to case basis    so special  dispensation  in  area  limit  is  required for government companies  as the government companies play a very vital role in meeting the raw material requirements of the industries the area limit should be relaxed in respect of areas reserved for prospective or mining under section 17 a of the mmdr act
