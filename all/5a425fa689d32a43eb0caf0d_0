  i  would  like  to  request  the  hon members to pay a special attention to this bill because this bill is the need of the hour    we  have  been  discussing  about  some  regulation  in  the  real  estate  for  the last  11  years  because  all  the  buyersconsumers  across  the  country  are  agitated rightly  and  they  are  not  getting  adequate  redressal  system  as  per  the  previous arrangement  so keeping that in mind during the upa regime a bill was brought and the bill was referred to the standing committee  the standing committee has made  certain  recommendations    out  of  30  and  odd  recommendations  2223 recommendations were accepted  in between there was a change of government and the government that came has brought it in the form of a new bill  the bill which  was  approved  by  the  standing  committee  consisting  of  lok  sabha  and rajya sabha members was again referred to the select committee of rajya sabha and the select committee of the other house has done an excellent job  the bill was debated and decided in the rajya sabha almost unanimously  the purpose of the  bill  is  that  it  is not  only  going  to  make  consumer  the  king  but bring  in  such needed regulation and transparency to the people who are involved in this sector  this bill seeks to create a set of rights and obligations for both the consumers as well as developers  secondly this bill seeks to encourage both of them to live up to the expectations of each other as per the agreement entered into by both of them  if they mutually agreed upon nobody is going to intervene  unfortunately what is happening  is  that  the  buyers  or  the  consumers  are  always  at  the  receiving  end  this  bill  seeks  to  establish  a  regulatory  authority  with  which  the  developer  will register the project to be launched  secondly while doing so they have to declare all  project  related  information  including  the  details  of  developers  status  of  land various approvals project schedule information regarding architects and structural engineers  etc  so  that  there  is  transparency    all  these  things  will  be  in  public domain    thirdly  the  disclosure  helps  the  home  buyers  to  make  an  informed choice    apart  from  promoting  fair  play  in  real  estate  transactions  it  also  aims ensuring timely execution of the projects  timely execution is a major issue  the bill  seeks  to  provide  uniform  regulatory  environment  and  orderly  growth  of  the real  estate  sector    we  feel  that  the  real  estate  developers  are  also  partners  in development    we  in  the  government  do  not  believe  that  private  sector  is  bad  public and private partnership is the need of the hour  the manner in which it was passed  in  the  upper  house  clearly  highlights  that  the  highest  legislature  of  the land  could  do  it  to  further  the  aspirations  of  the  people    i  was  moved  by  the response of the public on social media also after the rajya sabha cleared the bill  our aim of housing for all by 2022 is not possible by mere efforts of the central government or state government alone  government of india state governments and then private sector also should join in a big way  we have so many prestigious projects in the country  that is why even the fdi also is coming in this particular sector    there  is  so  much  concern  among  the  industries  circle  as  to  what  will happen  to  the ongoing  projects on  ongoing  projects  whatever agreement one has entered earlier stands  all of what i am proposing will apply for the future projects along  with  the  projects  which  have  got  stuck  now  regarding  the  provision  of imprisonment  for  any  violation  of  the  orders  of  the  regulatory  authority  some concern is expressed in certain quarters including some sections of the media   if they are not violating any of the orders of the regulatory authority nobody is going to touch them  the consumers courts also will have jurisdiction with regard to the cases wherein some people have a grievance  there cannot be a consumer without a developer and vice versa  and we have to protect the interests of both  nobody should create any hurdles with regard to land acquisition  i would therefore urge upon all the people concerned try to come to some sort of understanding about the land  acquisition  bill  so  that  the  land  is  made  available  for  the  housing  sector  the  government  is  aware  that  40  approvals  are  required  for  housing  project  and the important thing is that they should be given in time  approvals are taking six months  time  one  year  two  years  or  three  years  also    that  is  why  during  the discussion  on  this  bill  i  appeal  through  this  house  to  all  the  state  governments and also urban local bodies to be proactive  we insist on early completion and we must also see that speedy approvals are given  i am dealing with that separately    model  building  bye  laws  are  being  finalised  by  the  ministry  of  urban development  in  consultation  with  the  ministry  of  environment  and  forests    we are at an advanced stage and will be announced for the public so that they need not come  to  delhi  for  environmental  clearance  for  a  project  up  to  a  particular  level  that  responsibility  is  given  to  the  urban  local  bodies  revision  of  national building code is finalised after taking our suggestions  ultimately our target is to ensure  that  all  required  approvals  are  given  in  about  a  months  time    to  ensure housing  for  all  the  government  has  launched  the  prime  ministers  awas  yojana with  an  intention  of  constructing  two  crore  houses  for  urban  poor    keeping  in view  my  request  to  give  housing  an  infrastructure  status  a  number  of announcements  regarding  the  concessions  whether  they  are  service  tax  income tax or fdi have been made by colleague  hon finance minister  i will be further working with him  i would like to see a day wherein the interest rates are further brought down  the only way to bring down the interest rate is that the economy should grow  in this bill we have almost incorporated majority of the suggestions of  the  standing  committee  the  select  committee  and  also  suggestions  given informally by various people  keeping that in mind i would urge upon this august house to please understand and appreciate the intent as also the objectives of this important bill and extend full support
