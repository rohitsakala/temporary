 the primary objective of the bill is to regulate adolescents from working in certain types of employment and to permit children in family enterprises subject to certain conditions  however the provision must not serve  as  a  loophole  to  allow  for  exploitation  of  child  in  the  name  of  family  run enterprises    most  children  who  are  academically  inclined  do  not  have  time  for anything  other  than  eat  sleep  and  study    this  leads  to  lack  of  communication skills  team  work  discipline  and  most  importantly  the  common  sense  in  them    i grew up in usa working from the age of 10 years  i worked about 10 to 20 hours per week  it gave me lifeskills  it taught me the dignity the labour  we should encourage parttime work and should take every step to instill dignity of labour in children   but  it  should  be  based  on  minimum  performance  in  school   i  strongly feel  that  the  labour  ministry  should  also  have  a  monitoring  mechanism  at  the central  level  to  keep  an  eye  on  family  enterprises  to  ensure  that  this  provision  is not misused  the bill adds a new category of persons adolescents children who are  between  age  group  of  14  and  18  are  categorised  as  adolescents  and  are prohibited  from  hazardous  processes    this  is  also  a  welcome  move  of  the government    the  penal  provisions  in  the  bill  are  too  weak    i  request  the  hon minister to double these penal provisions because this is not enough of a deterrent  i  would  urge  upon  the  government  that  with  these  changes  we  also  bring  in enforcement to ensure that it is not abused and children are treated with dignity
