 the land of delhi has been grabbed in the name of dda and even the single inch of land has not been spared for the development of villages and consequently those villages remained undeveloped  i would like to urge the minister that a scheme should be formulated for the development of delhi  the government  should  make  such  arrangements  that  may  facilitate  the    removal  and resettlement of the slums at the same time  i would like to request that the  section 81  and  133  which  had  been  the  root  cause  of  corruption  during  the  earlier government should be abolished
