  this  is  an  important  bill  and  is  being discussed in entirety in the standing committee  the government is expecting that the report would come in the next session  how did the government arrive at the conclusion that immediately this one section has to be amended  but it seems that the  government  is  attempting  to  exempt  the  public  servants  from  its  provisions  why  is the  government  in  a  hurry  to pass  this  bill  without discussion by  keeping the public servants and the members of parliament out of its purview
