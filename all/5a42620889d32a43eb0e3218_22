  this  legislation  is  full  of ambiguity  and  loopholes    i  feel  that  it  will  be  very  difficult  to  implement  it  exemptions to employment in the house level will forfeit the entire purpose of the main clause  the quantum of punishment has been enhanced  it is very good  but in the era of outsourcing employer needs to be defined clearly then only culprit could be found  with regard to monitoring vigilance and monitoring committees headed  by  the  local members  of  parliament  may  have  been constituted  to  review implementation    i  would  suggest  it  is  better  to  restore  the  original  clause categorizing 85 industries as hazardous occupation
