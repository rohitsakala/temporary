  agriculture  sector  has been neglected by all the previous governments for the last 50 years  so  farmers are compelled to migrate in other sectors from agriculture which is likely to create a big problem in the agriculture sector in future  i would like to make demand to the  government  that  present  union  government  should  give  attention  to  the agriculture  sector  on  the  lines  of  the  steps  taken  in  gujarat  in  this  regard  government  has  increased  the  insurance  cover  for  farmers  under  krishi  bima yojna which is a commendable step  it is my request that more attention should be given  to  promote  research  and  training  in  the  agriculture  sector    similarly students  exchange  programme  farming  exchange  programmes  should  be undertaken  with  the  universities  situated  in  the  developed  countries  excelled  in agriculture    in  addition  to  that  there  is  a  need  to  set  up  small  water  bodies  for water conservation in drought affected states and districts so as to utilize it during the  impending  monsoon    there  is  also  need  to  give  priority  to  the  river interlinking project  it is my request that government should consider opening of a agriculture technology institute on the lines of itis  shri p k biju agriculture is the biggest contribution of countrys gdp with 17 per cent of the total  but the growth of the agriculture is only a staggering 22 per cent  but it is a shame on the government that ex cept sugarcane all crops have been showing a negative growth  taxes forgone for corporates have gone up by about rs30 thousand crores and are put at 21 per cent of gdp  on the other side  the  budget  which  boasts  of  a  farmers  budget  is  escaping  from  the  sordid realities of the indian agrarian sector  in the last 20 years nearly 300000 farmers have  ended  their  lives  by  ingesting  pesticides  or  by  hanging  themselves  moreover the new pricing policy by the central government in fertilizer industry will have huge  negative  impact  on  the poor  and  marginal  farmers in our  country  similarly  the  regional  comprehensive  economic  partnership  rcep  free  trade agreement  with  india  and other  15 njations the agriculture and  plantation sectors in kerala are staring at an uncertain future as they fear that once the pact is signed it  will  sound  a  death  knell    for  these  sectors    kerala  will  be  one  of  the  states worstaffected  by  the  rcep  agreement    there  will  be  a  direct  impact  on  rubber and spices and an indirect impact on coconut  pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana and  kisan  credit  card  have  failed    the  two  biggest  problems  with  the  design  of pradhan  mantri  fasal  schemes  is  that  first  even  extremely  poor  farmers  are expected to pay the premium  second if the farmer gets trapped in a cycle of debt and defaults on his agricultural loan his policy becomes inoperative   it is a matter of  big  concern  that  out  of  the  total    geographical  area  of  india  almost  onesixth area with 12 per cent of the population is drought prone  the amount allocated for microirrigation projects is a paltry sum  it is a fact that around 94 per cent of the existing  farm  credit  corpus  goes  directly  to  agrobased  industries  and  not  to  the farmers    rural  credit  is  another  important  sector  neglected by  the  budget   more than  half  of  the  agriculture  households  are  in  debt      government  allocation  is indeed  the  highestever  budgeted  allocation  for  the  mnrega  rs47499  crores  however  years  of  underallocation  have  meant  the  scheme  has  runup  sizeable deficits  that  are  rolled  forward  every  year  making  less  funds  available  for commissioning  fresh  works    india  faces  serious  problems  of  hunger  and  undernutrition  which  is  related  with  the  performance  of  the  agriculture    the implementation of the national food security act will add the woes of the states especially  kerala  where  rice  is  the  staple  food    the  act  will  do  away  with  bpl and apl categorization and a large number of families will be left out of the public distribution system
