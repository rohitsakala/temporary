  land is a state  subject   it would  have been  a  better  idea  had  this  been  sent  as  a  model  bill  to  the  states  with  states enacting  their  own  bill  to  regulate  the  real  estate  sector  this  bill  would  bring several state government agencies under the purview of the act  the bill provides for prior registration of real estate projects with a real estate regulatory authority and  talks  about  the  area  and  number  of  apartments    the  power  to  modify  the threshold  limit  should  vest  with  the  state  government  and  should  not  be appropriated  by  the  central  government    the  amount  realized  for  real  estate project  from  the  allottees  from  time  to  time  shall  be  deposited  in  a  separate account  to  be  maintained  in  a  scheduled  bank  and  shall  be  used  only  for  that purpose    it  should  also  be  made  mandatory  for  the  promoter  to  submit  the accounts  for  the  projects  to  the  real  estate  regulatory  authority  every  quarter  there  should  be  penal  provision  apart  from  the  return  of  the  amount  and compensation if the promoter fails to complete or unable to give the possession of apartment  or  building    this  bill  will  result  in  making  homes  and  flats  more expensive in india  this would drive genuine small time marginal developers out of the realty business and mncs would only thrive
