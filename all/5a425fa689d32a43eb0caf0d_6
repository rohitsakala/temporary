 it is a much needed bill considering the fact that though the real estate sector is one of the most important sectors of our economy and though it provides direct and indirect employment to cores of people yet it also remains one of the most unorganized sectors the most important step in this  bill  is  that  the  developer  will have  to  put 70 per  cent  of the  money  received from  the  customers  for  a  new  project  in  a  separate  escrow  account  so  that  the funds are not directed to start a new project  this is a huge step to ensure that the construction is completed within the stipulated time  there are many provisions in the bill which give comfort to the buyers against delay and fraud  the bill states that the registration with the regulatory authority is required only for those projects where land is more than 500 square metres or if the number of units is more than eight    i  fail  to  understand  the  rationale  behind  this  ceiling    the  bill  states  that registration is not necessary for redevelopment projects  so is this law applicable to such projects or not  although the bill focuses on developers accountability it should have also brought the civic and other related bodies that are responsible for permission  under  its  ambit    the  bill  has  put  the  onus  of  the  conveyance  deed entirely on the promoter or the developer of the project and the buyers have no say in  the  matter    ideally  there  should  be  a  provision  for  the  deemed  conveyance  to protect  the  interest  of  the  home  buyers  with  respect  to  the  title    i  hope  some  of these concerns will be addressed satisfactorily
