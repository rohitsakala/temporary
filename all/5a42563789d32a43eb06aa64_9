  overall  this  bill  is  very  positive    but where i stand in my dilemma is whether 16 is good or 18 is good  so i would like the minister to explain this because there are critics of this bill also who have over a  period  of  time  worked  with  children who  have  reservations on  making  18  into 16  one nirbhaya case is the reason why we are doing this  laws cannot be made by  emotions    there  is  another  aspect  where  article  15  of  the  constitution  talks about protecting all our children  but from 16 years to 18 years is a very small and very tender gap  this is a very serious bill which is going to have a social impact for  a  lot  of  people  for  generations  to  come    if  the  minister  could  kindly  clarify what is the roadmap for the future we would definitely like to hear from here  the places  of  safety  is  something  that  we  really  need  to  look  into    basic  abuse  of children and young boys starts in these shelters in a lot of cases i would like the hon minister to  make sure that every child is protected  making sure that there is no  conflict  of  this  bill  with  the  constitution    this  bill  is  about  psychology sociology  and  legal  aspect    every  child  is  an  asset  to  this  country    i  hope  that whatever choice we make for them is the right decision
