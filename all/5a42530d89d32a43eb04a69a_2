  the  indian  farmer  has always  stood  by  indias  food  security    it  is  they  who  increased  food  grains production  from  50  million  tonnes  in  1951  to  about  270  million  tonnes  in  2017  while the per acre production and productivity have been increasing the per acre income  of the  farmer  has not  been  increasing at  the same  level   the  intermittent droughts  floods  cyclones  and  unseasonal  rains  have  all  been  taking  their  toll  on the farmers  even during the current year the entire rayalaseema region nellore and  prakasam  districts  of  southern  andhra  pradesh  were  badly  affected  by drought    northeast  monsoon  is  a  total  failure  and  that  is  why  even  drinking water  has  become  a  big  problem  not  only  for  the  human  beings  but  also  for  the cattle  although the budget expresses an aspiration to double the farmers incomes in  five  years  period  but  there  is  no  clarity  how  it  can  be  achieved  without increasing msp which is the only source of income  for any income to double in a period of five years there should be an annual growth rate of 20 per cent in msp  agriculture being a highly location specific activity the costs of production differ for different farming situations  the costs and productivity differ for irrigated and unirrigated  areas    the  government  has  to  advise  the  cacp  to  recommend different  rates  of  msp  for  different  farming  situations    even  when  it  comes  to budget allocation for 201718 there is an increase of just 12 per cent  in the last two  years  the  country  has  witnessed  unprecedented  drought  and  with  no  reliable insurance  system  in  place  and  very  low  msp  for  various  crops  the  farmers  have suffered  heavily    the  government  should  seriously  consider  bringing  a  loan waiver  scheme  at  least  for  affected  farmers    the  target  of  rs  10  lakh  crore  for agriculture credit for 201718 is not even 10 per cent increase  there is a need to increase the target of bank credit for small and marginal farmers from the present 75 per cent to fifteen per cent of the total bank credit  in conclusion i would like to  say  that  the  farming  community  in  the  entire  country  is  in  great  distress  and agony  that is why the governments both central and state should come to their rescue  by  giving  reasonable  minimum  support  price  supply  of  quality  seeds fertilizer water power and access to easy bank loans
