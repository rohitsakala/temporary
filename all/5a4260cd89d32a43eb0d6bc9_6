  the  people  belonging  to  scheduled caste got the benefit of reservation by virtue of the poona act and for this they had to struggle a lot  the main intention and spirit of our founding fathers was that if the  reservation  policy  is  implemented  in  letter  and  spirit  then  the  people  of  sc community  would  come  into  the  mainstream  of  the  society  but  this  was  not implemented that way  this is the reason that this community is still neglected and backward  even  after 70  years  of  independence   three universities of the  country were declared as central university at the time of independence  they are banaras hindu university delhi university and aligarh muslim university  the policy of reservation  is  being  fully  implemented  in  the  bhu  and  delhi  university  while appointing teaching and non teaching staff  but the aligarh muslim university has not  been  implementing  the  reservation  policy  thereby  depriving  sc  and  other backward classes from this benefit  the successive governments of uttar pradesh have  not  raised  this  issue  in  all  these  70  years    if  more  and  more  castes  are included  in  the  list  of  scheduled  caste  like  this  then  the  interest  of  other  caste which are already there in the existing list would be adversely affected because the supreme  court  has  pegged  the  limit  at  50  per  cent    i  therefore  request  the government to consider on this aspect also when any such proposal comes to it in future
