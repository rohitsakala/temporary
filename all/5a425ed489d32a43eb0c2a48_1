  there  are  as  many  as four  bills  before  us  today    in  fact  this  was  an  important  game  changer enactment and this bill was introduced promptly by the then upa government  it is more than seven to eight years passed now  who is the loser in delaying it  it  is  the  people  of  this  country  and  we  lost  about  a  total  of  rs  12  lakh  crore  with  regard  to  these  bills  i  would  like  to  submit  that  preparation  for implementation  has  not  been  done  to  the  satisfaction  of  authorities  concerned whether  of  the  states  or  the  centre    besides  small  businessmen  and  traders particularly must be made to understand the nuances of the new law  there are ten  working  groups  constituted  to  look  into  specific  issues  of  sectors  like banking  finance  insurance  telecom  etc    but  there  are  several  other  very important and crucial sectors where the groups have not been formed and i do not even find any committee or group formed to look into that problem  there is  no  clarity  with  regard  to  excise  free  zones  like  the  northeast  and  other backward  states  and  special  economic  zones    this  will  discriminate  against the  development  of  these  regions    similarly  there  is  no  clarity  on  how  antiprofiteering provision would be implemented  i would like to ask that how can you invoke it in a market economy  ultimately there are a number of people who can be put inside jails for no reason  the antiprofiteering penal provision in this gst bill is far too vague and draconian  it could discourage companies from  making  efficient  improvements  in  supply  chains  as  they  are  required  to pass  on  the  entire  benefit  to  the  consumer    a  very  important  sector  like  real estate that is supposed to be the area which generates a lot of black money has been ignored by you  the government had not included it  as far as interstate movement  of  goods  is  concerned  there  is  substantial  increase  in  the administrative procedure and documentation  this will increase red tapism this will be a big impediment in business operations  in addition to that entry tax is not clear with respect to the merger of different taxes with  the gst  as far as the tax rates are concerned  there are too many rates  this itself will defeat the objective of the gst  regarding the cesses we do not know the fate of various cesses  surcharges  and  additional  excise  duty  and  we  need  a  clarification  on that    there  should  have  been  some  strict  prohibition  to  ensure  that  no  cess surcharge  or  additional  excise  duty  would  be  imposed  henceforward    again taxation  of  selfsupplies  proposes  all  interstate  movement  of  goods  and services between two divisions of the same legal entity would be subject to tax  in fact any movement of goods and services from one state to another becomes subject  to  tax    the  refund  itself  is  not  automatic    it  should  have  been automatic    a  major  aspect  of  this  bill  is  that  the  gst  council  is  only  an extension  of  the  executive    it  is  only  a  coordinating  body    the  central legislation  will  have  no  power  to  abrogate  the  power  of  the  state    as  per  the present  wording  it  appears  that  only  the  gst  council  and  the  central government  matter  as  a  notification  can  be issued  merely  on the recommendation  of  the  council  by  the  central  government    this  is  a fundamental  contradiction  to  the  basic  legal  framework  and  legal  relationship between  the  union  executive  and  the  union  legislative  as  envisaged  in  the indian constitution  any ambiguity on this issue lead to lot of hassles for the tax payer  taxation has to be simplified  i would like the government to spell out  how  this  basic  provision  of  tax  compliance  and  tax  reporting  will  be simplified from the point of view of the tax payer  i would also like to ask from the government that what was the need to have a new definition of agriculture sector in the gst bill  it will bring agriculturist in the back door into the tax net even as most farm produce are exempted from gst  you have made some calculations for compensations but that is not adequate at all  the gst debate now continues on categorization of products  are parachute hair oil and edible oil one and the same  maybe a lot of corruption and harassment will get in  if you  avoid  all  these  things  from  the  scrutiny  of  parliament  everything  can happen    has  the  government  evaluated  the  prospect  of  igst  leading  to cascading  effect  on  prices  and  its  impact  on  inflation    will  there  be  a  fair mechanism  to  ensure  that  originating  states  do  not  suffer  revenue  losses  as igst  is  a  destination  based  tax  which  favours  the  net  consuming  states  only  the  issue  regarding  distinction  between  the  central  tax  administration  and  the state tax administration has to be explained  i have already told you that there will be turf war  what started out as a single tax and a single market dream for industry  has  now  degenerated  into  five  rates  and  a  cess on  top  with  additional uncertainty about tax rates  administration both at the state and centre will be technological nightmare  with regard to many appellate bodies i would like to submit a fundamental mistake has been committed and it will be struck down by the judiciary  liability linkages provisions are extremely bad  there is no provision  with  regard  to  inflation    gsts  have  been  withdrawn  in  many  other countries because of profiteering and also because of inflationary measure  the intention is very  good   but ultimately  the  government is landing  this  country into an area of tax distortions and there could be anarchy and war between the states and the central administration
