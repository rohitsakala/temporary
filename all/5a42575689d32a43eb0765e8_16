  i  also  take  this  opportunity  to congratulate  the  hon  minister  for  bringing  a  good  bill  to  protect  the  academic standards  in  our  indian  institutes  of  managements  in  the  country    the  sole purpose  of  this  bill  is  to  give  effects  to  a  statutory  recognition  and  also  to  give autonomous  status  to  the  higher  educational  institutions  in  the  country    i  would like to suggest that government have to strive in such a way that india becomes the best destination  for  having  higher  education  and  quality  education   i have  sound reasonable  apprehension  about  clause  92  which  says    that  every  institute  shall strive  to  raise  funds  for  selfsufficiency  and  sustainability    as  regards  fee determination  i  would  urge  upon  the  hon  minister  to  take  this  aspect  into consideration because  higher  fees  means  that  the  poor  and  common  students  will be  denied  the  right  to  have  access  to  higher  educational  institutions  like  indian institutes  of  management  in  our  country    you  kindly  understand  my  point  with regard  to  clause  10    the  governing  body  or  the  board  of  governors  is  the executive  body  of  the  institute  and  the  board  will  consist  of  the  chairperson nominated  or  appointed  by  the  board    except  the  central  government representative  and  the  state  government  representative  all  other  representatives are being nominated by the board  so at least convince this house as to how this board  is  going  to  be  constituted    as  regards  receiving  donations  and  gifts  from foreign countries it has to be restricted and some condition should be there
