  the  mental  act  of  1987  was institution  based  and  the  focus  of  treatment  was  through  the  institutions  and regulatory methods  in this bill of 2016 which is in the process of becoming act our focus has shifted from institutions and gone towards community whereby we have tried that the people may opt for the treatment while remaining as a part of community    we  have  tried  to  make  the  bill  patient  centric  and  in  the  process empowering  them  while  deviating  from  the  institution  based  form  of  treatment  we want to empower the patient in order to ensure that they get proper treatment while removing all the hurdles being faced by them during the treatment  through this act the individual will get the power of giving advance directives in regard to as  to  how  his  treatment  should  proceed  under  a  particular  circumstance  which means  he  can decide  whether  it  should be  community  based or  institution based what  facilities  to  chose  from  etc  and  he  will  be  vested  with  the  legal  power  of giving  such  advance  directives    this  is  a  very  progressive  provision  which  has been inserted in the bill  similarly the legal provisions for an individual to make nomination  have  also  been  made  in  the  bill    we  can  also  make  provision  for decriminalization  of  suicide  once  this  bill  is  passed    earlier  we  used  to  give electroconvulsive  treatment  ie  ect  to  the  patients    now  ect  cannot  be administered without the use of anesthesia  ect cannot be given to children and they  cannot  be  subject  to  psychosurgery    there  is  a  need  for  getting  informed consent  for  psychosurgery    we  have  tried  to  put  an  end  to  all  kinds  of  harsh  or inhuman treatment which was in vogue earlier  we have also added certain penal provisions in the bill so that action could be taken against the persons involved in illegal  activities    one  of  the  suggestions  made  was  regarding  inclusion  of  role models  we have taken very good initiatives in form of hiring brand ambassadors to cover a large number of our health programmes  we will also try to make this programme  a  success  through  brand  ambassadors    the  hon  members  have  also suggested to add the self help groups  we will certainly launch programme for the  sensitization  of  all  including  asha  mnm  etc    but  there  is  no  need  to mention  it  in  the  bill  right  now    as  far  as  inclusion  of  psychotherapist  is concerned we will go by the directions of the expert committee  the government would make every possible step to upgrade the institution like nimhans  when this  bill  is  made  an act  all the  ensuing structures  will  be  thoroughly  funded  and arrangement of training will also be made  the question was also raised as to why judiciary has been given representation in the district board  i would like to tell that  it  has  been  done  because  judiciary  is  required  for  adjudication  and implementation  of  the  legal  aspects    the  legaljudicial  angle  is  required  to  be monitored  by  the  judiciary  in  case  of  any  punitive  action    earlier  a  mentally  ill patient used to face sterilization which will no longer be the case because it was an inhuman  act    secondly  now  the  onus  of  taking  care  about  their  health  and hygiene is on the institutions  as far as mother and child subject is concerned a provision for giving reason has been made in case of separating the child from the mother   the  issue of  alcohol  and drugs  was  also  raised  that  they  should  also  be considered  as  a  part  of  mental  illness    we  have  already  accepted  so  in  our definition  the issue of trained manpower has also been raised and we are doing our  workout  for  that    we  are  planning  in  way  where  we  are  going  to  involve ashas  and  anms    through  various  measures  we  are  trying  to  strengthen  our mental health infrastructure   the bill as amended was passed
