  the  benami  transaction prohibition act was enacted in 1988 to curb the tendency of benami transactions across the country  but it is also true that this objective of the government was not fulfilled because there were various shortcoming in it  now after removing these shortcomings  this  bill  has  been  brought    as  per  the  economic  survey  many economists are of the opinion that 70 per cent wealth of the country is concentrated in  the  hands  of  only  1015  per  cent  people  and  in  the  last  70  years  rich  have become  richer  and  poor  more  poorer    the  main  reason  behind  this  fact  is  that black money generated in this country have been stashed in certain other countries and benami properties were purchased here  i feel that after the passage of this bill this trend is going to end in this country and disparity between poor and rich will also come to end  i would like certain clarifications from the government  there is  a  need  to  bring  certain  amendments  in  income  tax  act  also there  are  certain people in the society who wish to transfer their property to their relatives and what is  the provision  in  those  cases   another point  is  that  in  our  country  various  land are owned by gods and few lands of gurudwara sahib are owned by guru granth sahib also  in this regard clarifications must be given in this bill so that there is no confusion left  i feel that comprehensive clarification should be given in this bill
