  so  far  as  i  know  there  has  not  been any  discussion  on  alcohol  or  industry  related  to  it  since  1965    earlier  madhya pradesh used to get molasses from state of maharashtra as the state had its no sugar mills    but  maharashtra  government    had  adopted  a  policy  not  to  sell  a  grade molasses  to  other  state    though  the  madhya  pradesh  used  to  have  this  a grade molasses    but  on  paper  it  was  b  grade  molasses    as  i  was  student  of  science  i knew  that  if  alcohol  is  prepared  with  b  or  c  grade  molasses  it  would  increase percentage  of  methyl  alcohol  and  would  cause  deaths  to  those  who  consume  it  as  expected  number  of  the  incidents  of  death  took  place  at  that  time  czechoslovakia started liquor industry and even patronized it but later on it had to suffer a lot and the industry was closed there  therefore sooner or later we have to move towards deaddiction
