 the cess is proposed to be increased from rs25 to  rs200  in  the  amendment  bill    this  will  adversely  affect  the  financial condition  of  the  sugar  mills    the  sugarcane  growers  are  also  not  going  to  be benefited either  today sugar industries are on the verge of closure and hence we should try to sort out their problems  the government released rs6000 crore for sugar mills but no mill succeeded to get even a single penny due to the eligibility conditions prescribed therefore  consequently no farmer is getting their arrear of payment    if  any  mill  is  paying  their  arrears  it  is  doing  so  by  disposing  of  its assets    the  levy  of  cess  will  fructify  only  when  the  varieties  of  sugarcanes  are improved    the  efforts  should  be  made  to  revive  the  closed  sugar  mills    the programme chalked out by you is not going to be successful as this has brought the farmers  at  the  losers  end    therefore  the  government  should  have  a  specific policy for sugarcane
