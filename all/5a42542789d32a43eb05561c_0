 ordinarily civil suits involving value  of  rs20  lakh  and  above  some  under  the  original  civil  jurisdiction  of  the high court of delhi  this has been increasing the workload of delhi high court considerably  poor people seeking justice had to face great difficulties every time  as this bill seeks enhancement of pecuniary jurisdiction this will help them in a big way  after passing of this bill the pecuniary jurisdiction of delhi high court will see a rise in the value of cases handled there  cases pertaining to lesser value will  henceforth  be  handled  by  the  district  courts  and  the  city  civil  courts    in tamil  nadu  judiciary  is  getting  proper  support  from  our  government  be  it providing  infrastructure  facility  or  be  it  providing  properly  recruited  presiding officers to administer justice  tamil nadu is way ahead  i would like to point out that no funds were released for the state of tamil nadu in the years 201011 and 201112  for  enhancing  judicial  infrastructure  under  the  centrally  sponsored scheme  i want to draw the attention of the hon law minister to take necessary steps  to  release  sufficient  funds  for  still  better  functioning  of  judiciary  in  tamil nadu   shri  tathagata  satpathy  the  delhi  high  court  amendment bill 2015 is a very simple bill  this is supposedly intended to lighten the burden on the high court of delhi  it is also interesting to note that when judiciary in all the states is heavily laden with disputes and longlasting litigations  delhi has had the  good  fortune  that  the  central  government  has  constituted  no  less  than  14 subordinate  courts  to  lighten  the  load  of  the  high  court  and  i  hope  that  the government  will  also  be  considerate  in  setting  up  more  courts    in  odisha  we have a situation where we can set up more courts whereby our judiciary will also be  lightened  of  the  load    the  aim  of  a  civilized  society  is  that  justice  should  be meted out as quickly as possible  there was a revision like this in 2003  i am not clear  whether  it  is  actually  required  or  the  government  can  devolve  the  power whereby  the  concerned  high  court  itself  can  take  a  decision  may  be  in consultation with the government raise its own financial pecuniary bottom up and bring it higher and pass on the burden to lower courts  that is something which the  government  can  think  about    we  have  certain  issues    according  to  the  last estimate  we  have  more  than  three  crore  cases  pending  in  different  courts  across the  country  has  there  been  an  positive  move  to  ensure  that  this  figure  comes down  i  would  like  to  know  from  the  hon  minister  whether  the  government  is thinking  of  bringing  a  system  of  taking  punitive  action  on  the  false  and  flimsy cases that are filed by people  my last suggestion would be that a system has to be worked  out  whereby  the  proceedings  in  cases  must  take  place  only  when  the applicant or the litigant the one who has filed the cases or the  prosecution if it is compelled  to  supply  all  relevant  papers  at  all  different  stages  free  of  cost to  the accused or to the other side  that way it would help people and would stop people from going to courts immediately at the drop of a hat
