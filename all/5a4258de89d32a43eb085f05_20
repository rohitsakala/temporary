  the  condition  of  research  in  india  is  very pitiable    indian  institute  of  petroleum  and  energy  bill  will  prove  to  be  a milestone  it is my request that such an institute be set up in northern india also  much research is needed in the field of solar energy wind energy and alternative energy    barauni  refinery  the  only  major  refinery  was  set  up  70  years  ago    my suggestion is that through the csr initiative the institute can be developed  there are  immense  reserves  in  purnia  baisee  and  between  bengal  and  assam  which needs  to  be  explored  there  is  no  shortage  of  reserves  in  india    what  lacks  is research  i congratulate you for setting up such an institute
