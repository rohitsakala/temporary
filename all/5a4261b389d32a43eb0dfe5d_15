  i  would  like  to  congratulate  the  hon minister  for  bringing  the  mental  healthcare  bill  2016  as  it  is  a  welcome  move  this is the good thing that all the persons suffering from mental disorders will be able to get medical coverage after the bill is passed   in this respect i would like to  make  a  request  that  a  person  attempting  to  commit  suicide  should  be  given treatment  instead  of  registering  a  criminal  case  against  him    the  hon  minister should pursue this matter with the ministry of law in order to make provisions to this  effect    the  insurance  companies  should  be  given  strict  orders  facilitating proper treatment of such patients at an affordable premium  we will have to make proper  budgetary  provision  for  the  treatment  of  such  patients  in  201718  budget  a  punitive  provision  of  this  bill  providing  for  imprisonment  of  six  months  or  a penalty  of  rs10000  or  both  for  the  noncompliance  of  the  provision  is insufficient according to me  at the same time the persons suffering from mental stress can also be accommodated by converting nirbhaya kendras into counseling centres
