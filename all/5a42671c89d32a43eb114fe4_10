  the  bill  indian  standards  bureau  bill  2015  seeks  to replace  the  indian  standards  bureau  act 1986   india is  a  country  of  consumers  our prime minister has ushered in a new chapter by announcement make in india for  exporting  the  indian  products  in  the  international  market    therefore  it becomes  all  the  more  important  that  we  possess  those  standards  which  could establish the identity of indian products in the international markets  it is not only in terms of the exports but also keeping in mind the fact that india has a population of 125 crore with the products and services reaching upto the last hamlets of every village that we require the services and articles of top most quality  i would like to request the hon minister that  when  we  talk  about  hallmarking  only  321  agencies are  there  that  are  going  to  take  care  of  standardization    i  would  like  to  know whether  the  government  had  allowed  selfcertification  in  hallmarking  also    i would like to request that if the government propose to allow selfcertification then it  is  desirable  that  our  laboratories  are  also  of  the  international  standards    the penal provisions under the bill are very lax  the law should be stringent enough not  to  allow  anybody  to  misuse  the  isi  mark  and  manufacture  the  substandard articles  so  that  isi  mark  could  find  a  distinct  identity  for  the  indian  products  in international market  by only doing this we will be able to give a new direction to the consumers of the country
