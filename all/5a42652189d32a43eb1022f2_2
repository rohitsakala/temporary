  the  hon  member  has  to  really appreciate  that  withdrawal  of  the  bill  is  one  part  and  another  part  is  introducing the new  bill   trade unions  had been demanding  since  long that the  payment  of wages  should  be  done  in  a  transparent  manner  so  that  the  workers  are  not exploited  this act was passed in 1936  major technological transformation has come since then  in the digital process all payments should be made through the bank  account  or  through  cheque    so  it  is  in  the  interest  of  workers    we  have come to the house for its withdrawal in accordance with the procedure  you may find out small technical reasons but it is really in the interest of the workers and is the need of the time  that is why we had come up with an ordinance  now the ordinance  has  to  be  replaced  for  which  this  bill  has  come    i  think  we  should welcome it the bill by leave was withdrawn
