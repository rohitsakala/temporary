 regarding the bill i would like to state that auction is necessary in the bill it has been stated that the central government has received a representation  from  industry associations  stating  that  the  subsection  has  caused difficulties  which  does  not  allow  merger  and  acquisition  of  a  company  having captive  leases    here  i  would  like  to  know  whether  we  are  working  for  the companies  and  the  corporate  or  whether  we  have  to  seek  a  balance  between  the interest  of  the  business  community  as  well  as  the  toiling  working  class  also  regarding  the  dumping  of  waste  i  want  to  say  that  it  has  created  quite  a  lot  of problems  and  lives  of  millions  of  people  are  in  peril    mines  are  owned  by  the industrial  houses corporate  millionaires   there  is  mafia  operating in  the  mining sector of india  the mining sector is one of the important sectors which is giving employment for millions and millions of people  but the labour laws which have to  be  implemented  at  the  grassroot  level  are  not  being  implemented    if  you  are saying  about  inclusive  growth  and  cooperative  federalism  then  the  state government  is  also  one  of  the  stakeholders  my  humble  request  is  that  a  bill whether it is a new bill or any amendment bill should be thoroughly looked into and  consultation  with  various  stakeholders  should  be  done  by  the  concerned departmentallyrelated  standing  committee    but  the  recommendations  of  the departmentallyrelated  standing  committees  are  not  being  accepted  by  the government    we  have  to  protect  the  prerogative  and  the  power  of  the departmentallyrelated  standing  committees  only  in  the  committees  we  can have  a  thorough  discussion  with  the  concerned  officials  with  the  trade  union leaders  with  tribal  leaders  and  also  with  various  stakeholders    so  their recommendations suggestions complaints and apprehensions have to come before us  my request is that even though this bill seems to be a small bill this bill has to be sent to the concerned standing committee and their recommendations should come before the house
