  we  welcome  the  national institutes of technology science education and research amendment bill 2016 to  add  the  nit  in  andhra  pradesh    however  it  is  also  my  duty  to  bring  this attention of this house the complete disregard of this government for the principle of quality in its quest for mere quantity what for instance is the current state of this  year  nit  in  andhra  pradesh    the  nit  with  900  students  functions  out  of  a temporary  campus  there  are  no  laboratories  no  libraries  no  high  quality  it  or engineering  tools  for  training    we  have  a  situation  where  we  have  created  an institution  which  was  not  ready  to  be  launched  but  in  a  haste  they  have  gone ahead   i  want  to  contrast  this  to  what  we  have  just  seen  in  my  constituency  two weeks ago when a fully functioning central polytechnic the best known in kerala established  in  1949  was  derecognized  by  the  aicte  for  not  fulfilling  a  list  of conditions that they deemed had to be fulfilled if that same list were applied to the new nit in andhra pradesh it would have been derecognized by the same aicte so  the  problem  in  our  system  is  that  our  higher  education  is  overregulated  and undergoverned    there  is  a  larger  problem  that  is  hidden  behind  this  bill    even our premier iits are facing today a shortage of trained faculty  according to the governments own figures it is about 42 per cent in the iits but in the nits the shortage  is  now  in  the  glaring  vicinity  of  50  per  cent  of  the  authorized  faculty    we cannot run education like this  on top of that employers across the board are complaining  about  the  unemployability  of  indian  graduates    a  recent  ficci survey shows a figure of 62 per cent of employers are dissatisfied with the quality of our engineering graduates the fact is that in our haste to add more on paper we must not lose sight of the fact that these are meant to set new and higher standards  we are spending in the latest budget of this government  12 per cent of our gdp on higher  education   whereas south  korea  which  is  not  far  away   it  is  24  per cent  double  of  what  we  are  spending    even  our  fellow  brics  members companions  in  the  developing  world  are  leaving  us  behind    they  have  policies that focus rightly on quality and not just quantity  let me again remind you about the kakodkar committee reforms  really we ought to take those into account and implement  them    in  global  ranking  we  know  our  iits  will  feature  in  the  top hundred  when we come to the nits they do not feature anywhere in the top 500  i  fully  agree  with  the  remarks  of  the  hon  minister  about  the  importance  of innovation  india today has 17 per cent of the worlds brains because we have 17 per  cent  of  the  worlds  people    but  we  are  only  producing  35  per  cent  of  the worlds  global  research  output    what  are  we  doing  to  tap  the  possibilities  of industryacademia  interface    i  had  suggested  when  i  was  there  earlier    that  we could  allow  companies  to  come  directly  to  our  iits  and  nits  and  say  here  is  a research project  if  the  students  are  prepared  to  research  on  this  we  will have  an agreement  we  will  innovate  something  and  nit  can  share  the  profits  with  the private companies  it happens very commonly in the west  but we need a policy decision  that  will  allow  the  nits  and  other  institutions  to  have  this  kind  of relationship with companies  i ask you mr minister are we doing them justice  what  is  the  government  doing  to  align  the  establishment  of  educational institutions like this nit that we are approving today with market research  what kind of engineers do we want in india or what do employers want what does the government want what does the future want  we have talent in our country but we do not know how to mould it how to put it forward  and i would urge you mr minister that the ministry itself should come up with a national level incentive to  encourage  more  innovation  in  the  nits  iits  and  elsewhere    my  party  and  i want more higher education institutions to open their door to indias young people who are hungry for education  but we all want these additional institutions to be solid to be well equipped with teachers and resources  let us by all means declare this  nit  to  be  an  institution  of  national  importance  but  let  us  also  make  it  an institution of truly national importance    dr  kambhampati   haribabu  the  andhra  pradesh  reorganization  bill  states  the  establishment  of  about  11  institutions  in  andhra pradesh  when the state was divided we were not left with any iit iim or even a single  nit  or  iiser    i  compliment  the  government  for  taking  such  a  bold decision  to  start  nine  institutions  out  of  11  promised  in  a  span  of  20  months  of time  i also compliment the minister for providing 480 seats in the very first year of establishment of nit  the funds were allocated  i request the hon minister to take steps to see that the construction of the buildings is taken up immediately and finished  expeditiously    again  i  have  a  suggestion  for  the  hon  minister  to consider    there  are  foreign  financial  institutions  which  are  coming  forward  to finance for the projects at libor interest rates or at lesser rates  i would request the hon minister to consider this suggestion  out of eleven institutions that were promised  for  andhra  pradesh  nine  have  been  established  only  two  are  left  over for establishment in andhra pradesh one is the central university and the other is the  tribal  university   these  two  universities  are  to  be  considered  for establishment  in  andhra  pradesh  at  the  earliest    i  have  two  suggestions    one  is encouraging  quality  in  education  and  the  other  is  innovation    i  request  the  hon minister to consider how university colleges can also be brought on par with nits and  other  institutions    i  think  if  we  can  take  steps  for  this  the  quality  of engineering education can improve
