    once  this  bill  becomes  an  act  and  is  implemented  has  a significant impact on the taxation methodology on india in our present system there are multiple direct and indirect taxes and multiple assessing officers the nature of economic activity today is changing because a number of these taxes by  their  nature  are  converging  even  though  we  become  a  political  entity  in 1947  india  remained  different  economic  entities  every  state  had  its  own  tax and  different  tax  rates  because  of  which  a  lot  of  economic  resources  are  lost there is no free flow of goods and services in the country the object of gst is to have one tax whereby each assesse has only one interface with one assessing officer it should become a more efficient tax which is not easy to breach so that compliance  is  higher  the  constitution  of  india  clearly  divided  the  power between the centre and the state through the central list the state list and the concurrent  list  if  the  centre  exercises  it  that  power  prevails  in  division  of power there was no grey area the idea of gst actually created the grey area the grey area is that you will have a tax which will be jointly imposed by the centre  and  the  states  it  will  be  one  tax  the  centre  and  the  states  will  all merge their taxes into that one tax the centre and the states have both pooled their power into one tax there is a shared sovereignty between the centre and the  states  we  have  created  indias  first  federal  decision  making  authority  by the method of pooled sovereignty the centre and the states will jointly decide what  the  taxation  rates  are  how  the  laws  are  and  how  they  have  to  be administered today when you have tax on tax the good becomes costlier once all that is  removed the  goods  will  become  slightly  cheaper  the recommendation of the law and the rates will come from the council  it  is  the  gst  council  which  will  decide  the  rate  the  gst  council  got  the power under article 279a to make a recommendation with regard to the model law  there  will  be  parliamentary  control  there  will  be  control  of  state legislatures  on  annual  financial  statements  and  on  the  rates  which  were included  in  the  financial  bill  ordinarily  those  recommendations  are  to  be acted  upon  and  in  case  these  are  not  acted  upon  we  can  refer  it  back  for reconsideration therefore read article 246a and article 279a harmoniously and  therefore  the  authority  of  law  that  article  265  talks  of  is  the  law  framed under article 246a which parliament and state assemblies will approve on the recommendation of the gst council  therefore this is the authority of law in accordance with article 265 the government has adopted compensation cess formula instead of taxation formula for compensating states if the government had followed taxation formula the total tax impact of funding the compensation through a tax would be abnormally high a rs 172000 crore of tax would have to  be  imposed  for  the  central  government  to  get  rs  50000  crore  in  order  to fund  the  compensation  there  will  be  no  extra  burden  on  consumers  in  this formula it will remain transient for the period of 5 years so that this can be used as far as the compensation is concerned you have raised it as to why this is a money bill this bill seeks to replace the central excise law the service tax law  the  vat  law  and  the  various  other  taxation  laws  it  consolidates  them into one according to article 110 of the constitution if a bill seeks to impose a tax  it  shall  always  be  deemed  to  be  a  money  bill  some  member  were uncomfortable about the idea of an antiprofiteering clause an antiprofiteering clause  is  that  nobody  must  have  an  unjust  enrichment  because  of  taxation  if there is a tax rebate then it must be passed on to the consumer that is the antiprofiteering clause which is there in this bill shri moily rightly argued that tax evasion  takes  place  in  real  estate  transactions  also  so  real  estate  should  be brought under the ambit of gst as  i said in the beginning that it is a federal body  and  we  have  to  consult  states  also  in  this  matter  but  the  states  were apprehensive  that  if  the  real  estate  is  included  in  the  gst  the  collection  of stamp  duty  etc  would  be  affected  thereafter  the  chief  economic  advisor prepared a paper in which he said that the states can keep their stamp duty and other revenues that they get out of it these are the advantages the states will get the finance minister of delhi made a detailed presentation to the council making a strong case why real estate should be included after listening to him and these presentations the council decided  let the gst be implemented in the very first year we will take up the issue of real estate whether we have to bring it within the consideration itself or not same is the position with regard to petroleum products and potable alcoholconsumable alcohol states held that huge revenue is involved in these products and they cannot agree with regard to these  products  after  deliberations  we  persuaded  the  states  and  told  them  that alcohol would be spared but petroleum would be included in the gst through constitutional amendment today petroleum has been constitutionally within the  gst  but  its  gst  will  be  zerorated  once  the  experiment  of  gst  moves forward  the  council  will  have  an  opportunity  without  amending  the constitution to decide what is to be done with regard to the petroleum products itself the council had some apprehensions regarding certain issues but so far as the council has worked i have thought it proper that we would take decision on the basis of consensus the review of the revenue service was that as far as the  igst  law  is  concerned  it  has  to  be  entirely  centrally  administered  the reasoning they gave was from the language of the constitution itself as also the fact  that  if  there  is  a  dispute  between  two  states  then  one  or  the  two  states should not become the adjudicator this issue was discussed at length and by a unanimous decision we arrived at an arrangement if you see article 258 of the constitution if the centre has to perform taxation function which is under igst we can perform under the constitution the centre is empowered to delegate it to  one  of  the  state  many  regional  parties  including  the  west  bengal government  were  very  particular  on  the  sharing  of  this  power  with  the  states itself and did not want centre to exclusively have this power the council took an  alternative  view  i  then  had  a  meeting  with  the  current  cag  and  i conveyed  to  him  the  views  that  your  authority  remains  unchallenged  or unchanged  but  the  source  of  your  authority  is  the  constitution  as  also  the provisions of the cag act itself that jurisdiction remains if you have hired contract  labour  but  it  does  not  mean  that  the  products  you  call  agricultural products  will  also  be  taxed  these  products  can  still  be  zero  rated  and  you should consider this with this point of view i think there is no confusion in this because these products are to be kept in category of zero rated products i was referring  to  the  banking  provision  with  regard  to  exemption  from  multiple registrations there is a overriding power under clause 148 which is there the central  government  only  has  a  ministerial  job  of  notifying  the  rates  the central government does not decide the rates madam the council is going to be  as  i  said  a  permanent  body  and  that  permanent  body  is  represented  by almost every state government literally by every state government  all the bills were passed    2017 by lok sabha secretariat note  it  is  the  verbatim  debates  of  the  lok  sabha  and  not  the  synopsis  that
