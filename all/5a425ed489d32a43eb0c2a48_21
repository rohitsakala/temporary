    i  congratulate  the  hon finance minister for introducing the gst bill  the hon finance minister has a very balanced approach towards setting up the gst council and this approach has been instrumental in the introduction of this bill  such a council has been constituted  first  time  in  the  history  of  india    the  centre  and  the  state governments  have  been    granted  equal  rights  in  this  council  which  is  a historical  move  and  thus  the  government  has  set  up  a  truly  federal  council  the gst will bring all the existing taxes under one umbrella and it will help in setting up single window system and it will also help towards the ease of doing business  it will reduce the overheads costs and thereby the capital investment of  the  manufacturers  will  come  down  which  will  help  their  end  products  to compete  in  the  international  market        it  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  our exports and will also help in setting up proper monitoring mechanism
