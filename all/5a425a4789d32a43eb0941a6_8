  i  thank  you  for  giving  me  this opportunity  to  express  my  views  on  election  laws  amendment  2016    voting rights should be given to those bangladeshi citizens who have been living in india since  long    the  government  should  also  consider  the  condition  of  bangladeshi people living in metro cities on large scale  their condition is very much pitiable  they  have  no  shelter  and  no  access  to  potable  water    i  would  urge  upon  the government that apart from voting rights they should also be provided shelter and other facilities
