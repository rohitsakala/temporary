  i  express  my  utter  disappointment about the direction in which this government intends to take or has started taking this  country    people  ask  as  to  why  when  the  prices  of  petroleum  products  are falling drastically in the arab countries it is not happening in our country  let us allow the poor indian to build up some reserves in their families with which they can survive the vagaries of economic ups and downs that the whole world is seeing today    very  surreptitiously  this  government  has  taken  upon  itself  the  task  of imposing  income  tax  on  agriculture    hardworking  farmers  earn  some  money through  house  rent  or  by  having  a  taxi    that  makes  some  income  which  is  now being clubbed as income from other sources  just because 4000050000 farmers are cheating on income tax let us not punish the two to three crores of farmers who are genuine toilers who are not rich and who are working for survival  the second point  is  political  funding  through  electoral  bonds    finance  minister  also  in  his budget speech mentioned that political parties reportedly get about 70 per cent of donations  through  cash  and  a  mere  30  per  cent  through  cheques   so  this  30  per cent was what was taxable  now they will be allowed to buy electoral bonds and that  too  incognito  secretly    they  are  helping  them  hide  that  little  amount  also  all of us know how the fcra rules had been changed in the last 201516 finance bill    now  that  shows  that  foreign  funding  can  come  to  political  parties  in  india very  very  secretively  and  in  that  process  you  are  allowing    people  foreign companies to lobby here  you should legalize this lobbying or make it in such a manner  that  people  can  pay  up  in  white  and  that  should  be  acceptable    the draconian  search  and  seizure  provision  in  the  income  tax  is  my  next  point    in clause 50 of this bill the government has proposed a curious amendment to allow it officials not to disclose their reasons for conducting search and seizure finally my  last  point  is  that  the  npa  problem  is  getting  worse    this  years  economic survey points out that bad loans have doubled since last year  again i would like to ask that how can the economy grow when the bank lending growth has declined to a 60 year low of a mere five per cent  that is a 60 year low  we are in a partial state of recession  since there are reports of massive job cuts across sectors  from it real estate and everywhere  if the government claims that the seven per cent figure is true it has to be living in denial it is not accepting the reality
