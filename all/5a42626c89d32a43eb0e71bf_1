  i strongly oppose the introduction of the insolvency and bankruptcy code 2015  my first objection is regarding rule 69  according to rule 69 the financial memorandum should very specifically state the recurring and  the  nonrecurring  expenditure  to  be  incurred  when  the  bill  becomes  a  law  unfortunately  nothing  is  mentioned  in  the  finance  memorandum  regarding  the expenditure  to  be  incurred  out  of  the  consolidated  fund  of  india    secondly  as regards rule 64 the bill is not published in the gazette and no advance notice of the intention to move the bill has been given  in such a circumstance we received the bill on saturday  we were in our constituencies and we could not go through the bill  the third and very important objection which i would like to raise here that there are 11 schedules in it  the schedules of the amendment act are there so as to avoid clause by clause discussion  my fourth objection is with regard to notes  to  clauses    where  is  the  note  to  clauses  in  respect  of  39  clauses  of  the companies  act  of  2013    this  bill  is  a  defective  bill  because  these  39 amendments  or  clauses  were  incorporated  in  the  eleventh  schedule  so  as  to  not have  any  notes  on  clauses  which  means  indirectly  evading  the  parliament  to amend the companies act and other major statutes
