 by amalgamating many central and state taxes into a single tax the gst would mitigate double taxation and would eventually pave  the  way  for  a  common  national  market  when  implemented  the  cgst sgstutgst  and  igst  would  be  levied  at  rates  to  be  mutually  agreed  upon by the centre and the states in the gst council i would like to suggest that the details of all these taxes may be made more simpler similarly the payment to government  and  subsequent  refunds  be  minimised  or  kept  at  a  minimum possible level the division of administrative control over taxpayers need to be reconsidered  regarding  the  power  to  collect  gst  in  the  territorial  waters  and its further delegation to the states i feel the act should specifically mention this and it should be made a part of the act itself as for the organizational structure and deployment of human resources i feel the ministry of finance should place report of the working group on the table of parliament
