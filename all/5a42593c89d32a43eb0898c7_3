 on the face of it this amendment is a very simple straightforward amendment to the nit act  it only adds one more nit in andhra pradesh  consequent  on  the  bifurcation  of  the  old  state  between  telangana  and andhra  pradesh    but  this  apparently  small  amendment  raises  some  very  deep questions  about  our  educational  policy  and  the  future  direction  of  the  younger generation in our country  we started out with eight regional engineering colleges and now we have many more but the 20 of them are upgradations from the status of  regional  engineering  colleges    subsequently  10  more  nits  have  been  added and  today we  are  about to  welcome  in  this  parliament the  birth  of  a new  nit  in andhra  pradesh    now  we  have  to  have  a  fine  balance  between  teaching  and research in all of our educational institutes including our universities both central and state in addition to the iits the nits and the iisers  when we go ahead and announce  the  establishment  of  new  institutions  do  we  actually  anticipate  the faculty  requirements  for  these  new  institutes    i  think  we  need  to  pay  very  close attention  to  these  issues    do  we  pay  adequate  attention  to  institutes  for  the humanities  and  the  arts    what  is  happening  in  our  institutes  of  technology particularly the nits is that we are not  producing wellrounded citizens  even in institutes of technology there should be arrangements to teach subjects in the field of arts and humanities  two years ago the then finance minister had announced that  there  was  going  to  be  a  national  institute  of  humanities  in  madhya  pradesh  even if we are not able to set up very many national institutes of importance in the field of humanities and arts there are other ways in which humanities and arts can be supported in our universities and colleges  we have a global role to play  we  must compete with the rest of the world and  make sure that our students and younger generation are getting the best education possible whether in the field of science education or in the field of arts and humanities
