 this bill effectively addresses most of the issues pertaining to the customer addresses some of the issues pertaining to the developer  but  does  not  address  the  issues  pertaining  to  the  competent  authority who  most  of  the  times  is  the  reason  for  delay  and  escalation  in  the  cost  registration  with  the  regulatory  authority  should  be  an  online  process  without  a human interface  for a building permission to be completed there is water supply electricity supply firefighting certificate and other certificates  so the developer is the customer to the competent authority  the competent authorities should also be liable if they delay the project  there is a clause that the developer as a safety measure  has  to  keep  70  per  cent  of  the  project  cost  with  the  local  competent authority  my suggestion is that it should be subject to the local condition  we are now setting up the real estate regulatory authority and appellate tribunal  who is  going  to  bear  the  cost      there  is  rule  of  projects  over  500  square  metres  sometimes  a  clever  and  skilful  developer  may  try  to  circumvent  the  real  estate regulatory authorities  kindly take care of it  i wholeheartedly support the bill
