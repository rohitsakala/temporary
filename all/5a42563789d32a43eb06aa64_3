 when a child is committing a crime we are not having a system to study what has caused the child to adopt this path  it may be economic hardships family background environment or peer pressure  i believe that taking a reactive approach will not help this country  we have to take a long term approach in cases where we are dealing with children or infants  what the past has shown is that implementation of the law has been the biggest problem  therefore  probably  whatever  there  is  in  the  bill  we  will  have  some  600  plus juvenile  boards  because  they  plan  to  have  one  board  per  district    i  believe  that laws should  be so  framed  that they  are  very  easily  understandable   so with  600 districts  again  we  will  have  the  law  being  interpreted  completely  differently  at every  single  district    ambiguities  are  galore  in  this  bill    i  would  like  that  the government  should  reconsider  whether  setting the base  age  whatever  eighteen or sixteen whether that is wise or not  although i support the lowering of the age i believe  that  there  is  no  rationale  behind  the  number  sixteen  and  these  district boards should have the freedom to judge each and every case on individual merit  the other part that i would like to point out to the government is that there is a lot of discretion left at the hands of the police officer dealing with the children  now we  are  very  well  aware  that  our  police  officers  are  found  to  be  extremely insensitive  and  callous  in  most  cases  dealing  with  adults  when  it  is  a  child we obviously  cannot  expect  them  to  have  feelings  to  have  emotions  and  to  be bothered  about  the  future  of  the  child    so  i  would  request  the  government  that they  should  reconsider  about  the  discretion  of  the  police  officers  because  their sensitivity is something that one needs to actually question  the other point that i would say is that all the time when we are making our laws we are making it with a  very  shortsighted  approach  and  very  soon  by  the  time  the  law  is  actually implemented  at  the  ground  level  we  find  that  our  machinery  is  incapable  of handling it  so there should not be any ambiguity  yet it should be an open ended law which can transform itself over a period of time
