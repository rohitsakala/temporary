 all that i wanted to say that as a member of the standing  committee  on  finance  we  had  eight  meetings  on  the  benami transactions bill and we gave a unanimous report in which we said that fresh law should be brought  i want to ask the hon minister that why is it that you chose to override the unanimous recommendation of the finance committee and go ahead with the bill  the intention of the minister to eradicate black money is good  but by  bringing  this  act  he  is  opening  the  path  to  hell  because  in  the  statement  of objects and reasons of the bill does not state that the purpose is to eradicate black money   this  act has  a  provision  for  confiscation under 271  and  it  is  vested in the  central  government  whereas  it  should  have  been  vested  in  the  state government which allocated land  lastly i think this will open a serious problem in  rural  areas  where  there  are  no  proper  land  records  and  there  are  cash transactions  moreover the existing income tax act has adequate provisions and teeth to deal with issues such as tax evasion and unaccounted income  therefore he should take back the bill today and go for a new bill   the  minister  of  finance  and  minister  of  corporate
