 west bengal fought hard to preserve and protect  cooperative  federalism  in  the  process  of  formulation  of  gst    it  also fought  uncompromisingly  on  fiscal  autonomy  of  all  states  of  the  nation  on matters of gst  our leader and the present chief minister of the state of west bengal  had  in  principle  supported  the  concept  of  gst  as  early  as  2009  in  our party  manifesto    the  idea  was  to  usher  in  a  strong  and  cohesive  indirect  tax regime which creates a single market for all trade and industry and is beneficial for the common men small traders and enterprises  the compensation act will ensure  that  no  state  of  the  country  will  suffer  any  financial  loss  due  to  gst  west  bengal  pushed  hard  for  the  gst  threshold  to  be  raised  to  rs20  lakh turnover  so  that  the  small  and  tiny  businesses  are  kept  out  of  the  scheme  of gst additionally in order to ensure least  disturbance and to provide a single interface so that the assessee does not have to face more than one authority the concept of crossempowerment has been introduced in the law  the purpose of gst was to get rid of multiplicity of taxes and the related cascading effect and to unify different taxes into a single entry so that the illeffects of inflation can be  curtailed  to  a  large  extent    adding  to  this  the  removal  of  multiple  tax structure  means  a  reduction  in  the  cost  of  compliance  the  benefit  of  which should  finally  pass  down  to  the  consumer    another  important  benefit  of  the new gst regime is the boost to ease of doing business  it is expected that such a major reform in the indirect taxation structure will not only help curb inflation but will also have a very positive effect on gdp growth    having said so we are concerned in few arenas which i would like to point out to  considering the scale of the reform it is imperative that sufficient time is given to build up the structures  required  to  ensure  proper  implementation  of  the  gst  law    another area  of  concern  is  the  preparation  of  the  gst  network  gstn    this  is  one system  that  cannot  afford  to  fail its  failure  will lead to a  collapse  of  the  entire indirect  tax  system  of  the  nation    therefore  it  is  necessary  to  get  all  the modules  of  the  gstn  prepared  and  tested  as  quickly  as  possible    i  have  a request to  the hon finance  minister that we  should not hurriedly  rush  for this thing  we  should  look  into  this  again  whether  defects  are  there  in  it    it  is important that the implementation is also made by both centre and states in the true  spirit  of  cooperative  federalism  helping  build  the  nation  together    this should be the spirit  no one should ask for its credit  we should say that we all together have implemented it
