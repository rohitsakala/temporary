 we want that benami transactions in the  case  of  property  should  be  totally  stopped  in  our  country    we  think  some loopholes  are  still  there  in  the  act    establishing  adjudicating  authorities  and appellate tribunals to deal with benami transactions and specifying the penalties for entering  into  benami  transactions  are  good  intensions    had  the  loopholes  in  the income tax act 1961 been plugged we would not need a new bill  sometimes an  individual  can  purchase  land  for  the  sake  of  the  family  and  he  may  sincerely honestly  gift  it  to  other  persons    in  that  case  what  would  happen  has  not  been described in the amendments  this loophole should be plugged  it is stated in the bill  that  the  confiscated  properties  will  be  vested  with  the  central  government that should go to the concerned state government  for initiating and completion of the cases there should be a fixed time limit  for furnishing information about land only 30 days time has been given  i think this can be extended  it should be integrated with aadhaar or pan card  benami transactions are taking place only to create black money to keep the black money for political purposes and also for creating  election  fund  of  political  parties    if  the  political  parties  and  political leaders keep away from benami transactions and not use black money for political purposes then only  benami  transactions can be stopped in  this  country  we  hope that this bill becomes a very strong law
