  my  first  submission  is  that  the region  for  introducing  this  amendment  bill  is  a  court  judgment    nobody  is prohibited  from  visiting  a  gurudwara    the  one  who  respects  the  dignity  of gurudwara should be allowed to shoulder the responsibility of its management and only such persons should be allowed to vote  the guruji had said that khalsa is my  reflection    how  a  person  who  fails  to  posses  the  appearance  of  khalsa  can manage the affairs of gurudwaras
