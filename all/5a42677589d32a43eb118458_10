  nabard indeed can really do  something  for  the  nation  definitely  the  capital  should  be  increased  to rs30000  crore  and  we  support  it    however  banks  are  not  lending  to  farmers  the policy of the government is going in one direction and the banks which come under  the  finance  ministry  are  going  in  a  totally  different  directions  for  nonpriority  sector  instead  of  giving  rs400  crore  they  gave  rs3000  crore  and  for priority  sector  like  sheep  farm  land  development  water  resources  farm mechanization they gave rs 5 crore when it should have been rs100 crore  that is what the finance ministry has to look into  at the same time i am not here just to  complain    i  am  also  here  to  thank  the  ministry  for  what  it  has  done  for telangana   telangana  is  investing  in  the  rural  sector   they  have  given us loans for  irrigation  and  godowns    in  telangana  we  are  getting  huge  returns  on  our investments    under  sheep  programme  we  hope  to  get  something  like  rs25000 crore  as  return  in  three  years    all  over  the  nation  it  is  rural  to  urban  migration  but  in  telangana  particularly  in  two  districts  there  is  urban  to  rural  migration that  is  from  hyderabad  to  mehboobnagar  and  from  hyderabad  to  karimnagar  that  is  happening  because  of  the  irrigation  project  there    we  request  for  a  little more funds and we hope the minister considers it  rs 5 crore was earmarked for my district under the district credit plan  but the amount given was zero
