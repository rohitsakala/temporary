  let  me  straightaway first  preface  by acknowledging the fact that the valor and the bravery that have been shown by our soldiers  over  the  last  seventy  years  are  next  to  none  in  the  world    army  is operating with largescale vintage equipment  indias defence budget in 201718 has decreased from 24 per cent of gdp in 201112 to 21 per cent of gdp now  the previous defence ministers proposal to create a fund which would collect all unspent amount from the defence capital budget from previous years and make a corpus  fund  is  an  excellent  idea    capital  outlay  used  to  be  33  per  cent  of  the defence  budget  in  earlier  years    this  has  now  come  down  significantly  to  24 percent  and that  is  a matter of  great  concern   defence  procurement  procedure  is yet to be given a final shape  make in india initiative in defence sector appears to have borne no fruit so far at all  the minister shri jaitely has to unlock the fdi logjam in defence sector  regarding orop i do not understand as to why for nine months only rs 3000 crore has been spent  i would urge the defence ministry to arm  our  soldiers  give  them  what  they  need  because  there  is  no  dearth  of  their valour and bravery
