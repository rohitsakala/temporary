    this  seems  to  be  a  small  bill  but  it  has  far  reaching implication  in  our  country  i  would  also  like  to  know  if  one  institution  from  the state  getting  the  benefit  to  that  importance  of  national  institution  what  is  the reservation  policy  of  that  institution  that  is  not  clear  our  neighbouring  country china is spending more than us what is happening in our institutions of national importance  central  universities  and  iits  the  ministry  of  human  resource development has announced to increase the annual fees of iits from rs 90000 to rs 2 lakh the scst students get only 50 per cent concession that means they have to pay rs 1 lakh how is it possible i am myself a victim of this practice i had  got  the  admission  but  i  could  not  pay  the  fees  at  that  time  the  vacancy  of scst  teaching  faculties  is  because  they  are  not  ready  to  fill  up  our  higher educational  institutions  are  trying  to  create  their  institutions  as  elite  institutions they  are  not  ready  to  implement  the  regulation  of  this  country  they  are  not implementing the reservation norms i think the present minister will take care of these things because he has a lot of ideas in this regard lakhs of engineering seats are lying vacant in this country because the students do not have money to pay a huge amount of money is needed for getting admission in the private selffinancing institutions
