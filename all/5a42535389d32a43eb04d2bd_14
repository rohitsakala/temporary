  the  speech  of  the  hon  finance  minister  was  very  disappointing  as  he  tried  to  prove  with  figures  and  reasons  that  it  is  not possible  to  check  the  pricerise    his  speech  gave  an  impression  that  this government  is  least  bothered  whether  the  prices  go  up  or  come  down    this government made a promise during the elections that they would bring the prices down but it has failed in doing so  the president of bhartiya janta party termed those  promises  as  chunavi  jumla    increased  prices  have  become  curse  to  us earlier people used to say that even if they would not be able to do big things they would at least get dalroti but today even pulses are not affordable to the middle class people  inflation has reached at 788 per cent which is the highest in last 23 months   like pulses prices of  vegetables  are  also very  high  till now the  high prices affected the urban people more  but now it is seen that villages are more affected  by  high  prices    the  government  claims  that  it  is  taking  strict  action against hoarders  but hoarding goes unabated  in the end i would say that if the government is serious to check the pricerise it will have to take right measures
