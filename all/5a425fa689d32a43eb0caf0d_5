  the  real  estate  sector  is  the  second largest employer in the country  it contributes to about nine per cent of the gdp  there  was  an  absolute  screaming  need  for  regulation  to  be  brought  in    the excesses  caused  by  the  imbalance  of  power  during  negotiations  between consumers and sellers were indeed extreme  therefore there was a need to set up an  individual  authority  with  an  appellate  tribunal  to  address  the  concerns  of  the buyers  and  the  promoters    the  minimum  size  of  plot  required  for  registration  is 500 square metres  this ceiling should be done away with  my second point on this  issue  is  that  the  projects  under  development  would  be  included    i  think  to include them would create a lot of confusion  my suggestion to the hon minister would  be  to  fix  a  date  from  whereon  projects  seeking  application  or  projects seeking approval would be brought under the ambit of the authority  i will come to my third and slightly technical aspect  i think that the intent of the hon minister and the government is correct when they said that 70 per cent of the money given should be kept under an escrow account  but there are two issues in it  you allow the  promoter  to  put  a  certain  percentage  for  construction  separately  and  a  certain percentage  for  land  separately so  that  the  buyer  and  the  authority  is  aware as to how much money is going to go for what  you have left out covered parking and basement  parking  from  the  definition  of  common  area    the  builders  can  take advantage  of  this  and  charge  huge  amount  from  the  consumer    so  some regulatory input should be thee on that  the final point which i have is this  in section 2 n i common areas means the entire land for the real estate project or where the project is developed in phases and registration under this act is sought for a phase the entire land for that phase  when the projects are done in phases what  is  going  to  happen  is  that  people  are  going  to  take  the  common  areas  away from  the  genuine  apartment  owners  and  they  are  going  to  try  and  profit  from  it  there is a need to plug this loophole
