  i support the bills with a lot of reservations and  a  heavy  heart    i  think  that  the  gst  basically  is  a  transgression  into  the powers  of  the  parliament  when  we  are  giving  our  taxing  powers  to  a  gst council which does not have a representative character the states will have no freedom  to  decide  on  the  rates  at  which  they  choose  to  tax  commodities  we have to see that the states fiscal condition does not deteriorate  how will the compensation to the states be worked out  where would the money come from to compensate the state that has not been made clear in this let me mention clearly that the centre seems to be in a hurry  till now the government has not fixed up the rates  it has fixed the basic rates  but what is the rate of individual commodities  now there will be a problem of fitment  these basic questions have not been resolved  the business is totally unprepared for gst what will the small businesses do  the biggest problem of the gst is the gst network gstn    it  will  be  a  technological  nightmare    you  have  to  train  the businessmen in all the states for the job so instead of hurrying let us put the systems  in  place    lastly  prices  should  not  increase  in  this  year  of  transition  but prices may increase and that has to be taken care of
