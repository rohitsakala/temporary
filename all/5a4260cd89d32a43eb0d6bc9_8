 i would like to inform that nearly 30 per cent of the sc and st population is spread over in this country  only 15 per cent reservation is  there  for  scs  and  75  per  cent  is  there  for  sts    without  increasing  the percentage  if  a  community  include  in  the  list  then  it  is  a  burden  on  the  existing communities    hence  enhance  the  reservation  percentage  also    there  is  a  hitch here  as  regards  supreme  court  that  50  per  cent  should  not  be  crossed    the government  can  promulgate  an  ordinance  and  can  exceed  50  per  cent  because parliament is supreme
