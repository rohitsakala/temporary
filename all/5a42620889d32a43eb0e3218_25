 i would like to submit that the sphere of the child labour problem in india would increase by the introduction of the bill and in this efforts have been done to make methodology universally agreed upon through this bill the number of hazardous occupations have been reduced to three this is discriminatory with children i do not understand that government can give any reason for this because it is prohibited for them to work in such occupations secondly  we  talk  about  right  to  education  in  21th  century  this  is  a  right  which every child should have access to where every child should have right to higher education children are property of this nation they are part and parcel of house and  state  they  are  integral  part  of  our  country  you  cannot  leave  them  only  to their  parents  not  only  they  have  a  right  to  get  education  but  also  good  health good life style and good childhood they should get good youth and so they will become good citizens
