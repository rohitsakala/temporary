  we should always bear in mind that we do  not  end  up  reducing  the  importance  of  the  parliament  in  the  process  of passing the legislations having the far reaching or game changing implications for the country  i would also like to say that this is not a new policy  it is but like a stream of policy decisions which has faced hurdles and speed breakers on its way and we have successfully overcome those obstacles  on one hand it is being  propagated  that  our  economic  philosophy  underpinned  by  the  free capitalism should be uniform across the world while maintaining an integrated market  across  the  globe  on  the  other  hand  efforts  are  being  made  to  bring parochialism into the philosophy based on universal values  the growth during the last 70 years has been city centric capital centric and factory centric instead of being agricultural centric farmer centric and rural centric  there should be development in our backward areas  i would like to know whether we are going to  include  those  areas  into  our  newly  emerging  india  and  if  the  reply  is affirmative  then  how  the  government  propose  to  do  it    i  would  like  to  know from the government as to what kind of efforts it is going to make to address the problem of regional imbalance  gst is essentially an indirect tax  on one hand the government is making announcement to reduce direct tax while on the other it  is  increasing  the  indirect  tax  like  gst  whose  burden  is  to  be  shared  by  all  the  divide  between  rich  and  poor  will  go  on  increasing  and  it  wont  reduce  the government has included bidi in the list of luxury goods  there is a need to remove it from that list
