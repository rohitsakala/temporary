  on  behalf  of  the  telangana rashtra samiti i stand to support this bill  i was adjunct faculty member teaching electrical  engineering  and  i  interviewed  more  than  3000  electrical  engineers  in the last 25 years  the quality has really become abysmal  but if you ask them the simple  question  whether  there  is  current  because  of  voltage  or  whether  there  is voltage  because  of  current  most  of  them  do  not  know    even  the  ordinary electricians know more and that is the gap between theory and practice  some of our  apprentices  who  are  school  dropouts  are  better  than  some  of  our  mechanical engineers  nowadays there are shops which sell projects and also project reports  the government of telangana recognized that many engineering colleges instead of making the future of students bright they are destroying  engineers today are among  the  most  unemployable    so  i  am  very  proud  to  say  that  our  state  has actually closed down 174 engineering colleges which are substandard and wasting life of students  i think we need to take such proactive steps at the national level research  is not about  compilation  of  knowledge but  creation of new knowledge the  data  is  the  raw  material  for  creation  of  new  knowledge  and  that  is  no accessible  because  of  multiple  laws  relating  to  security  and  so  many  other departments some of these barriers of collection of data need to be removed the cost  of  education  is  important  if  you  are  increasing  fee  please  ensure  that  no deserving student is denied because of lack of funds there is a need to bring the industry  into  the  institution  and  take  the  institution  to  the  industry  through apprenticeship system and that will really help the quality of engineering
