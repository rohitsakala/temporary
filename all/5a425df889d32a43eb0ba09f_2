  all  of  us  understand  that  the  archaic  laws are  to  be  scrapped  as  they  are  creating  hindrance  in  judicial  and  administrative proceedings  there have been so many laws in the statue book which were framed nearly 150 years ago to meet the requirements of those days but in course of time they lost their relevance and their presence and are creating a lot of administrative problems    a  large  pendency  of  cases  was  attributed  directly  to  the  archaic  laws  all  of  us  will  be  happy  if  the  obsolete  laws  which  create  administrative  and judicial hindrance are weeded out  it should be a continuous process  our statue is full of obsolete laws some dating back to the 19th century and early 20th century  we know that since 18346612 central statues have been enacted and some point or the other 3821 have been repealed  the repealing and amending fourth bill proposes  to  repeal  295  obsolete  and  redundant  laws  lying  unnecessarily  on  the statute  book    the  departmentrelated  parliamentary  standing  committee  on personnel public grievances law  and justice has suggested the  sunset  clause   i make an appeal that the government should take efforts to make the laws simple  i fully endorse the views of the standing committee of parliament in this regard
