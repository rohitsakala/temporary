 i am very happy today because this august house is  going  to  discuss  a  historic  and  landmark  bill    this  bill  primarily  seeks  total prohibition  on the  employment  of  any  child  of  14  years in  factories establishments  shops  etc    we  have  linked  the  right  to  education  act  of  2009 with this bill  we want that every child should study in school  this is the very purpose of the right to education act  we have given a new definition  we have defined  a  child  having  the  age  between  14  years  to  18  years  as  adolescent    the adolescents  of  16  years  to  18  years  have  also  been  prohibited  to  be  employed  in hazardous  process    most  importantly  this  bill  provided  for  punishment  stricter than that of earlier act  the employer who violates the provisions of this act will be highly punished  it is a deterrent one  earlier it was noncognizable now it was made cognizable offence  another important point which i want to make clear is that  we  have  made  a  provision  for  the  constitution  of  a  rehabilitation  fund  for child  and  adolescent    i  also  appeal  to  all  the  hon  members  to  extend  their  full cooperation and to support this historic and landmark bill
