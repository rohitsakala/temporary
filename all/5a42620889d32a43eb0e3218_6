 child labour is the manifestation of abject  poverty    majority  of  the  child  labour  comes  from  poor  families  and  they have  to  work  to  sustain  themselves    according  to  the  government  there  are  43 lakh  adolescent  labour  in  the  country    however the world  labour  organization says  that  there  are  about  5  crore  adolescent  labour  in  our  country    according  to my own assessment there are more than one lakh adolescent labour in delhi alone  the parents have to send their children for work owing to poverty   there should be  provision  for  childadolescent  labour  and  children  of  poor  families  in  the government schemes in this bill the definition of family is quite dangerous  in the context of a child in this bill family means his or her parents brother sister brother  and  sister  of  father  and  brother  and  sister  of  mother    this  is  absolutely wrong  family means parents and real brother and sister only  i would therefore request  the  government  to  define  the  family  in  clear  terms    after  getting education  the  child  could  have  the  family  in  the  business  the  business  should therefore be defined so that the life of child is not spoiled  this bill cannot serve its  intended  purpose  if  it  is  based  on  one  department  only  hon  minister  should take into his cognizance the suggestions made by the parliamentary committee  i feel that we need a comprehensive bill to fully abolish the child labour
