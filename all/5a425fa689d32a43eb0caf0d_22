  i  am  thankful  to  all members who have spoken on this important bill  one hon member made out a point that parliament has no jurisdiction to pass this bill  the bill is meant only for  contract and transfer of title   the land  and other  related  issues  are  left  to  the local bodies  the law department as well as the attorney general has opined that the parliament has jurisdiction because it is a concurrent subject  so keeping that in mind only we brought this bill  but the main question is about the genuineness the promptness and the timeliness of the house delivery  this is the major concern of  the  people    the  earlier  government  has  brought  a  bill  in  2013    but  in  2011 itself the debate was started and from 2011 to 2016 for five full years the country was debating this issue  the media was also debating this issue  it will be historic moment in the history of the country because we are fulfilling the aspirations of the people by giving them the needed protection and also by giving credibility to the realty  sector   certain  people have  expressed  certain  concerns  for  example what will  happen  to  the  state  bill    the  central  legislation  overrides  the  state legislation   that is the constitutional position  a point made was why we should confine it to 500 square metres and eight apartments and why we should not reduce it  down    i  have  left  it  to  the  discretion  of  the  states  depending  on  the  local situation  i have given the option to the states to make legislation  i may politely remind  the  hon  members  initially  when  the  bill  came  in  2011  it  was  4000 square metres and the number of apartments was not notified  from 4000 square metres we have brought it down to 500 square metres  but it is not so the rate of interest  payable  by  consumer  and  payable  by  builder  varies    as  per  clause  2a the  rate  of  interest  payable  by  either  party  will  be  the  same    so  there  is  no discrimination  whatsoever    there  is  no  question  of  any  delay  on  our  side  moreover we have tried to hasten the process after wider consultation  we are not against  the  builders    we  want  builders  also  to  be  partners  to  build  strong  and stable india  i am willing to discuss with the builders if they have any problem  the rule says that if a member has any interest he or she should declare it before he  speaks  in  the  house    but  i  do  not  want  to  invoke  the  rule    a  concern  was expressed  by  the  hon  member  from  maharashtra  visvis  their  legislation  and also  on  other  issues    i  am  assuring  them  that  we  will  consider  them  during  the making of the rules  with regard to impact of this on property prices  i would say that  we  would  get  more  investment  we  would  get  early  clearances  and  the property  prices  would  come  down    the  only  purpose  of  this  bill  is  that  what  a developer is promising through an advertisement he should  fulfill it  through this house  i  seek  the  cooperation  of  all  states  because  this  law  will  be  really meaningful if the states come forward and then make those regulations and put the responsibility on the officers concerned  i am not trying to shift the responsibility from the central government to the state governments  with regard to the matter raised by a member that states should be given powers to appoint more authorities i  would  say  that  there  should  not  be  dual  authorities  at  the  same  time  certain powers are delegated to the states  it is provided in clause 20  then there is the point  of  structural  defects    now  the  responsibility  of  rectification  of  structural defects  lies  with  the  builder  promoter  and  developer  for  a  period  of  five  years  article  2  k  provides  for  an  exhaustive  definition  for  carpet  area    clause  42 provides that the promoter shall disclose at the time of  making an application for registration of the project with the regulatory authority regarding the number type and the carpet area of the apartments for sale in the project  for existing projects a window of three months from the date of notification has been given under clause 3  for  making  an  application  to  the  authority  and  to  disclose  the  same    future disclosure of  carpet area  would  not  affect  the past sales  under the  existing or ongoing projects  with regard to government bodies it has been brought within the purview of the act  the government bodies are collecting money and they are not constructing  houses  in  time    moreover  this  bill  will  reinforce  the  trust  and promote sales  the day this act is notified there will be a boom in the real estate sector and people will purchase houses with more confidence  private people will come and invest more with regard to government formulating a national urban rental housing policy the government is in the process of developing this policy and  a  model  tenancy  law  which  will  encourage  house  owners  to  let  out  vacant houses on rent so the government has shown its commitment its caliber  so i am  happy  that  our  friends  from  the  other  side  from  all  sides  are  supporting  us  the  bill  cuts  across  all  sections  particularly  the  middle  income  group  consumers have  been  facing  problems  and  harassment    phasewise  registration  is  also provided  in  the  bill   a  project  could  be declared  and  executed  in  phases  but  for every  phase  these  provisions  will  apply  70  per  cent  amount  is  the  criteria applicable for each phase separately  the bill provides for five years liability for structural  defects not  for other defects  the  bill  will  apply  uniformly  across the country    the  need  is  to  ensure  timely  completion  of  projects    the  definition  of allottee  is  very  exhaustive  and  i  have  already  explained  it    discrimination  is another issue  the constitution is already taking care of it that is why i have not made  any  separate  mention  about  this    under  this  bill  promoters  cannot  sell without registration of the project to the authority  i appeal to all the home buyers across  the  country  not  to  give  any  advance  before  registration  of  the  project    again central bill will override the state bill  that is the constitutional position  i  would  like  to  say  that this  bill  will cover  both  residential  and  commercial  also  moreover  standards  are  provided  in  32  for  promotional  measures    central advisory  council  is  being  proposed  for  advising  and  improvement  also  practically to the extent possible i have tried to cover all the suggestions given by the  hon  members    i  am  sure  that  this  bill  will  live  up  to  the  expectations  and aspirations of the people   the bill was passed
