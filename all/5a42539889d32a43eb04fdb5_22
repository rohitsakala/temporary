  when  it  comes  to  the  uttarakhand issue  as  per  the  rules  and  regulations  if  the  government  did  not  have  proper mlas there should have been a floor test  in the floor test if it had been proved that they were short of mlas automatically the government would have fallen  i do  not  understand  why  bjp  was  in  such  a  hurry  to  impose  presidents  rule  in uttarakhand  so unnecessarily using article 356 is not good for democracy  we have our rules and regulations in the assemblies as well as in the parliament  so i request that the state should be allowed to run properly
