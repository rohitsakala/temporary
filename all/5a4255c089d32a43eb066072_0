  in  this  small  bill  ceiling  the  is  proposed  to  be increased  from  rs25  to  rs200  per  quintal  under  section  3  1  of  the  sugar cess act 1982  at present per quintal cess is rs 24 against rs25  this cess is to be increased from rs 24 to rs124  currently the amount  collected from cess is rs500 crore which is likely to increase to rs2500 crore with the increase in the cess  secondly there is a provision for soft loan under which an interest free loan of rs4100 crore will be given for a year to the farmers of those sugar mills who have paid 50 per cent of the dues  if we provide rs500 crore yearly in the cane development fund then the same will be used for its development  thus a total  of  rs3000  crore  is  required  for  this  purpose    we  have  formulated  several schemes in this regard  the arrear of farmers has gone up to rs5068 crore and the old arrear is rs1025 crore thus the total arrears of farmers is more than rs6000 crore the farmers are facing problems and the development of the sugarmills is not  happening  there  is  no  modernization  of  mills  and  hence  additional  fund  is required  i believe this is an important move in the interest of the farmers and the sugar industry  i appeal to the house to pass it without any debate
