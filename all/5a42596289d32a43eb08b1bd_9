 this is one of the very good bills drafted  by  the  ministry  of  health  and  family  welfare    so  i  would  like  to congratulate  the  hon  minister  for  having  brought  forward  this  bill    there  is  a social stigma attached to this disease  that has been removed by the provisions of this  bill    there  is  a  clause  in  the  insurance  policies  which  excludes  hiv    my request to the hon minister is this clause should be removed because that person who has taken that health policy or the life policy should not be discriminated on the basis of hiv infection  secondly if a couple is hiv infected and their health status is good they should be given an opportunity for adoption  there is a need to waive  the  consent  clause  for  conducting  hiv  tests  in  cases  when  the  patient  is suffering from severe  medical problem not responding to treatment  it should be made mandatory in every hospital to have  a ventilator and a hemodialysis for the hiv  patients    today  what  is  important  in  the  country  is  educating  the  youth educating the  schoolgoing  children  about  these diseases   many  a  times  we  hold the hospital responsible if the data is leaked about any  hiv infected person  my request  is  that  instead  of  holding  the  hospital  responsible  we  should  hold  the person who has leaked the data and he should be punished  there are many cases where even doctors and staff have been infected with hiv in the course of saving the lives of the patients so i think in such cases compensation should be given to the doctor or the staff who has got infected with this  health related premarriage couselling should be stressed
