  i  rise to  support the  atomic  energy amendment  bill  2015    the  amendment  bill  allows  the  nuclear  power corporation to tie up with the public undertakings to form new energy producing units    the  indian  oil  corporation  ioc  and  the  national  thermal  power corporation  ntpc  have  expressed  willingness  to  go  into  and  join  such undertakings  it is a welcome stop  through nuclear energy has huge potential of destruction  but  now  the  attention  has  gone  into  peaceful  uses  of  nuclear  energy  the  thought  of  having  nuclear  power  plants  came  in  the  late  50s  and  early  60s  then the nuclear power corporation was established in 1962  then many nuclear power plants have been set up in the country  we have built a fast breeder reactor near mahabalipuram temples  so we will be less dependent on imported fuels  if we can have a nuclear reactor based on thorium then the problem of nuclear fuel would be solved for ever because we have huge deposits of thorium  the biggest advantage of nuclear energy is that it is clean  but there is a problem of disposal of spent  fuel    there  have  been  three  nuclear  power  accidents  in  the  world    safety considerations  are  very  important  as  far  as  nuclear  power  plants  are  concerned   one of the impediments is the civil nuclear liabilities act  according to our act the main liability for the accident will be borne by the supplier of the equipment  now  the  government  is  trying  to  open  it  up  to  others  so  that  indian  oil corporation and nptc can also participate but what expertise can ntpc of ioc offer  to  nuclear  power    with  the  environmental  and  climatic  concerns  being raised the nuclear energy can provide a big fillip to that  shri  tathagata  satpathy  the  atomic  energy  amendment bill  2015  needs  a  lot  of  thinking    the  government  is  planning  to  allow  only governmentowned  companies  to  invest  in  nuclear  projects    india  is  an  energystarved country and we need green energy  the sad part here is that you are going to invest in a system where the developed world is moving away from that system and moving away from production of atomic energy  we come into play because they  want  to  hive  off  all  their  unused  or underused  or nonusable nuclear  power plants to certain other countries  the major problem is the disposal of radioactive material    this  industry  in  india  is  nontransparent  unaccountable  and  it  works under a veil of secrecy  safety regulations are the first thing that goes for a toss  the  government  has  not  thoroughly  planned  or  trained  the  people  on  how  to  act during a crisis  even our officials are unwilling to take risks and are unwilling to take  care  of  the  basic  safeguards    giving  over  this  sort  of  a  thing  to  exclusively governmentrun agencies could be detrimental to the interests of the people of this country  i would suggest the government that they should take a rethink not only on this particular bill but also on nuclear energy to be produced in this country in the future
