    i  rise  to  support  the  constitution scheduled  castes order  amendment  bill 2017   the  people belonging  to  the scheduled  castes  category  have  been  completed  exploited  for  political  ends  and have been confined to vote bank status by the governments that have ruled during these  70  years   the  schemes  launched  for  them  were  never  implemented  on  the ground    i  would  like  to  thank  the  government  for  raising  the  fund  of  the scheduled castes sub plan rs38833 crore had been allocated last time which has been  raised  to  rs52393  crore    similarly  the  amount  under  the  tribal  sub  plan have  also  been  raised  from  rs24005  crore  to  rs31920  crore    this  is  good because  until  the  scheduled  castes  and  scheduled  tribes  people  get  funds  they would  not  be  able  to  economically  move  ahead  and  their  social  status  will  also remain static  i would like to thank the government for bringing in amendment in the atrocities act
