 this bill is almost a flawless bill but there are just a few quick doubts which need more clarity  if the national mental health policy  and  the  mental  healthcare  bill  are  implemented  completely  i  think  it would be a complete winwin situation for all of us so before we reach a level of getting adequate number of psychiatrists could we take help of our health workers or empower the ashas and train them a little bit till we finish off with this  the concept of counselors and psychotherapists needs more clarity  kindly clarify on psychotherapists what you expect out of them and how far they can go in treating them  so i think we need to have very stringent guidelines in this regard because these issues are all chemical imbalances   i think karnataka is   one of the states which  has  come  out  with  the  best  regulations    i  would  request  you  to  see  if alcoholism and drugs could be put into this bill as a mental illness  who will have the authority to exempt under section 65  the other point is about the budget and structure  of  district  level  mental  health  boards    these  boards  need  to  be  far more  active    the  government  should  consider  to  bring  all  the  drugs  that  are required  for  mental  health  in  the  essential  drug  list    the  last  point  is  womencentric  approach      women  do  not  get  help    the  bill  should  be  more  gendersensitive  so  that  women  can  get  treatment    even  in  divorces  and  separation women suffer  so i would take this opportunity to ask the hon minister to kindly clarify some of the doubts because it is a very strong bill
