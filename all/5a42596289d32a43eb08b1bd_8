  this  is  a  very  important  subject    i  do  not  find  the financial memorandum and the statement of objects and reasons in the bill  the hon  supreme  court  of  india  has  directed  the  central  government  to  give  art medicine to all hiv victims  the government has said that the art medicine for each patient would cost around rs28500  if we cannot give that much of amount for the victim of hiv how can we cure the patients in this country  we have seen 50  per  cent  reduction  in  the  number  of  new  hiv  infection    the  total  estimated hiv affected persons in our country are 208 million as per a report of 2011  what steps have been taken in our country to manufacturer generic antiretroviral drug in our country  it is a good bill  hiv is very much influencing our population  it is also  influencing  our  gdp  and  economy  this  bill  aims  to  end  this  epidemic  by 2030    this  bill  has  been  drafted  to  safeguard  the  rights  of  the  people  who  are affected by hiv  in my state of kerala we have seen that the rehabilitation of an hiv affected person is very difficult  the education of the hivaffected persons and their children is very much difficult in schools the bill also aims to enhance access  to  health  care  services  by  ensuring  consent  and  confidentiality  for  hiv related testing treatment and other clinical results  i think not only the government but the entire nation should be involved in awareness programmes  then only we can create a situation for the betterment of hivaids affected persons  the state and central government should ensure prevention of spread of hiv and aids and antiretroviral and access to welfare schemes especially for women and children  the hiv patients are not getting proper medical treatment in our hospitals this is something  very  alarming  i  think  government  should  come  out  with  some financial  support  to  the  states  to  ensure  protection  of  the  hiv  patients  and  their rehabilitation and treatment in their respective states
