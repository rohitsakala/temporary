 there is a proposal to include certain castes of five  states  in  the  list  of  scheduled  castes  through  this  bill    hindu  banjara  bot gurchhiya and rai sikh castes of uttar pradesh are a fit case for being included in this  list    but  the  state  government  is  not  recommending  to  the  centre  in  their favour  i believe that procedure should be amended in this regard that if the state government does not send its recommendation in a time bound manner the union government  even  without  the  recommendation  of  the  state  will  include  these castes in the list of scheduled castes
