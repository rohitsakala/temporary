  Without  going  to  the  Business  Advisory 

Committee  to  bring  a  Bill  to  the  House  is  not  proper.    This  is  not  the  way  a 

legislation,  and  such  an  important  legislation  particularly,  should  be  passed.  

Strangely, it is called a Code, but technically how can it be called a 'Code'?  Why 

because in a Code, all the other Bills will have to be repealed.  He has not repealed 

any Act excepting one.  So, this is also not a proper Code and I have certain points 

on  which  I  need  clarifications.    Firstly,  as  hon.  Finance  Minister  claimed  that 

liquidation  of  assets  was  not  a  workable  thing,    I  would  say  that  it  was  partly  a 

workable thing.  The idea was that if a company loses money for three consecutive 

years,  then  they  have  to  approach  a  body  called  the  BIFR.    Now,  hon.  Finance 

Minister is again forming a Board with a lot of power.  It will be called Insolvency 

and Bankruptcy Board of India.  But my basic idea is that we are again going into a 

blind alley  in creating too many multiple agencies.  We are concerned because in 

our State there are number of sick companies.  Lastly, he has said that all the assets 

should go into the Consolidated Fund of India.  Will the Government pay from the 

Consolidated Fund of India to revive or pay back the fraudsters?  So, I still want 

that this Bill should go to the Standing Committee.
