  I  feel  sad  whatever  happened  in 

Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. It is also a matter of concern that comments 

are  passed  on  the  highest  authority  of  the  country.  Today,  I  urge  upon  the 

Government  that  they  will  have  to  think  over  judiciary  as  well.  The  people 

belonging to media write anything against the Government today. Judges pass such 

comment that become the highlights of the newspaper and television. This does not 

augur  well  for  democracy.  So,  we  will  have  to  discuss  on  the  amendment  of  the 

provision of emergency. We will also have to take cognizance of the fact the way 

BJP  has  destabilised  the  democracy  in  two  states.  Therefore,  I  am  of  the  opinion 

that we must discuss on the provision of Article 356 once again.
