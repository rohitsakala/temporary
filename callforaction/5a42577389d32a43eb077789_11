  For  the  progress  of  any  country, 

development  in  the  fields  of  technology,  science,  education  and  research  is  needed.  

Many  higher  institutes  of  learning  like  IITs  and  IIMs  have  been  set  up  in  various 

states, including Punjab.  I would like to draw the attention of this august House and 

the Central Government towards the shortcoming and lacuna that are there as far as 

education  of  the  poor  and  the  downtrodden  is  concerned.    I  hail  from  the  border 

district of Ferozepur.  It shares approx 150 kms. long border with Pakistan.  Our area 

is very backward and no such institutes of higher learning are there in our area.  The 

hon.  Minister  had  talked  about  'Skill  Development'  scheme.    If  it  helps  the  children 

give  vocational  training,  it  will  go  a  long  way  in  providing  employment  to  them.

Education  must  be  made  available  to  the  poor  and  deprived  section  of  society.    A 

large number of Scheduled Caste people reside in my constituency.  The students of 

this  area  trail  behind  others  as  far  as  education  are  concerned.    So,  the  need  of  the 

hour  is  to  provide  educational  facilities  to  these  children.    Opening  up  new 

institutions  of  higher  learning  is  good  but  the  existing  schools  and  colleges  should 

also  be  maintained  properly.    Thousands  of  students  who  have  studied  in  technical 

education institutes have not been able to get employment.  So, employment avenues 

must  be  provided  to  these  educated  youth.    It  will  stop  the  spate  of  suicides 

committed  by  unemployed  educated  youth.    Scholarships  are  not  being  provided  to 

the eligible students in various institutes for the last 3 years.  The Government must 

ensure that this anomaly is removed at the earliest.
