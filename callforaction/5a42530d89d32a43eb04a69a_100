  India  is  an  agriculture 

dominated  country.    Our  government  has  taken  steps  for  the  development  of 

agriculture  particularly  organic  agriculture  which  will  not  only  result  in  excellent 

production  but  also  will  make  farmers  happy  and  prosperous.    The  condition  of 

farmers of Bundelkhand is not as good as it was before.  Due to untimely rain/hail 

storms and drought the condition of farmers is very pitiable.  Therefore, I request 

the Union Government to set up a Central Commission headed by retired judge to 

assess  the  present  socio-economic  condition  of  farmers  of  Bundelkhand  and 

address their problems.  I also demand that amount of claim under Pradhan Mantri 

Fasal Bima Yojana should be equaled with MSP of the crop.  In the last month of 

January,  the  crops  of  many  farmers  was  damaged  due  to  hail  storms  in  Jalaun, 

Garotha,  Bheganipur  areas.    There  is  a  need  to  provide  compensation  to  the 

farmers  of  these  areas  for  their  loss.    The  loan  of  the  farmers  should  also  be 

waived.  Urad seeds of Aazad-3 variety have been damaged.  Therefore, I demand 

that Uttar Pradesh Beej Bhandar Nigam should conduct a probe into it.
