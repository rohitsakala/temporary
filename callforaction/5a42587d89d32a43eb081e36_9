  The  Union  Government  has  sanctioned 

347.16 crore rupees for rural drinking water scheme to Maharashtra in the budget 

2016-17 but only 150.59 crore rupees have been provided in this regard which is a 

gross  injustice  to  the  Maharashtra  State.    So,  I  would  like  to  demand  of  Rs.  500 

crore for the Maharashtra.  Similarly, there is a need to provide 40 crore rupees for 

blue revolution project under fisheries department.  Besides, there is also a need of 

500 crore rupees under information scheme for modernisation and strengthening of 

the policing system in Maharashtra State.  With regard to post offices in Mumbai 

city,  I  would  like  to  submit  that  post  office  could  not  be  constructed  due  to  the 

paucity of funds.  Union Government should provide 300 crore rupees keeping in 

view  the  720  km  long  coastal  line  in  Maharashtra.    Apart  from  that,  Union 

Government should also provide 500 crore rupees for educational development in 

Maharashtra.  Under the urban sports infrastructure scheme Maharashtra should be 

provided  50  crore  rupees  in  the  current  financial  year.    Apart  from  that,  Union 

Government should accord permission by issuing NOC with regard to the land for 

developing marine waterways in Maharashtra.
