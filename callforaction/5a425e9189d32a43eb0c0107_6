  I  request  that  direct  flights  be  provided  from 

Ahmedabad International Airport for foreign countries.  Further I wish that a tourist 

circuit  should  set  up  to  link  Mhow,  the  birth  place  of  Baba  Sahib  Ambedkar,  the 

diksha bhumi Nagpur, 26 Alipore Road, Delhi and Chaittya Bhumi, Dadar, Mumbai 

with this airport.
