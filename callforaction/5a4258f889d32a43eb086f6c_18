  Ujjwala  Scheme  has  covered 

the  villages 

extensively.    Research  is  going  on  all  over  the  world  on  solar  and  wind  energy.  

Our  Government  also  is  engaged  in  giving  a  new  dimension  to  this  field.  

Certainly, we need to strengthen our research activities.  To make this an institute 

of  global  standards  we  should  enter  into  agreements  with  leading  nations  of  the 

world.  Gas is flared round the clock in Barauni and Agra refineries.  It should be 

tapped and bottled through research.
