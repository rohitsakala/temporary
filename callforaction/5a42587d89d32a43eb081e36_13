 The Income Tax has been reduced 

in  case  of  the  low  income  group  people,  who  are  the  salaried  persons.    It  is  also 

true that it is only the salaried class who have little chance to hide their income.  I 

would, therefore,  suggest  the  hon.  Finance  Minister  to  give  some  more  rebate  on 

taxes of the salaried people of lower income group.  In the last two years, there has 

been  no  expansion  of  employment  in  our  country.    We  find  that  the  revenue 

collection has increased this year.  It is mainly due to increase in Excise Duty on 

petroleum products.  The Government is lucky that since 2014, the price of crude 

oil  in  the  international  market  has  been  coming  down.    But,  in  spite  of  that,  the 

government  has  been  imposing  more  and  more  Excise  Duty  on  petroleum 

products.    So,  we  demand  reduction  in  the  price  of  petroleum  products  in 

compliance with the international market.  It must be reduced for the benefit of the 

common people of our country.  Now, I would like to speak on NPAs of the banks.  

Every year, the non-performing assets are increasing.  Now, it is Rs.11 lakh crore.  

But  now,  we  find  that  the  Government  is  advocating  to  recapitalize  the  public 

sector banks.  Finally, I would like to say that the people at large did not get any 

benefit from the demonetization.
