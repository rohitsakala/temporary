  The  Ministry  has  been  allocated  Rs.51,026 

crore  in  2017-18.    Between  2007-08  and  2017-18,  the  expenditure  of  the 

department  increased  at  an  average  rate  of  18.3  per  cent  annually.    However, 

expenditure  on  the  Department  as  a  proportion  of  total  budget  expenditures 

remained  in  the  same  range,  increasing  from  1.1  per  cent  to  1.9  over  this  period 

which is a matter of concern.  A major area of concern remains the underutilization 

of  budgeted  funds.    If  we  look  at  the  Capital-Revenue  expenditure  breakup,  I 

notice that 99.8 per cent of the Department's expenditure is estimated to be spent 

on  revenue  expenses  such  as  such  as  subsidies  on  premiums  and  interest  rates, 

among  other  things.    The  coverage  of  the  Pradhan  Mantri  Fasal  Bima  Yojana  is 

proposed to be increased from 30 per cent of all farmers in 2016-17 to 40 per cent 

in  2017-18,  and  50  per  cent  in  2018-19.    I  hope  these  targets  are  met,  and 

eventually we move towards a 100 per cent insurance coverage to all farmers.  The 

Ministry  must  focus  on  giving  much  more  visibility  to  the  schemes  to  that  they 

effectively reach the intended beneficiaries the farmer.  It is also essential that we 

move away from flood irrigation to the drip or sprinkle irrigation system.  The long 

term  irrigation  fund  has  been  provided  with  an  additional  Rs.20,000  crore  in  this 

year.  My humble suggestion to the Hon. Minister would be that the targets for the 

utilization  of  these  enormous  sums  of  money  must  be  clear,  concise.    In  each 

districts  of  newly  formed  Telengana,  there  must  be  a  proportionate  increase  in 

Krishi  Vigyan  Kendras  (KVKs).    I  request  the  Hon.  Minister  to  incorporate  the 

creation of these additional KVKs in Telangana.
