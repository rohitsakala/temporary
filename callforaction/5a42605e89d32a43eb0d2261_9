  I  wholeheartedly  support  this  Bill  to  facilitate  the 

setting  up  of  new  IITs  and  making  them  as  institutions  of  national  importance.  I 

would like to thank the Government for fulfilling the long pending demand of the 

people  of  Kerala  for  setting  up  an  IIT  in  my  constituency  Palakkad.  The  most 

urgent need of the hour is to make IITs more inclusive. What are the challenges in 

making IITs more inclusive? The first one is fee hike. Now the IIT education has 

become  costlier  than  education  from  some  private  institutions.  So,  we  need  to 

seriously think about this indiscriminate fee hike. The second most important issue 

as a challenge in making IITs more inclusive is the flawed reservation policy. The 

Government should ensure that the reservation policy will be strictly implemented 

both  in  admission  and  in  recruitment  of  faculties  in  IITs.  There  is  a  need  to 

implement  the  recommendations  of  Anil  Kakodkar  Committee  for  improving  the 

quality and standard of the IITs. The Government needs to seriously ponder over 

the steps to check the brain-drain of IIT educated students from the country.
