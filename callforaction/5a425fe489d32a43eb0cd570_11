  This  bill  seeks  to  correct  certain 

anomalies and will give the Scheduled Caste people  their due.  Some communities 

have been given different status in different states.  The same caste has the status 

of backward caste in one state and Scheduled Caste in another state.   Other castes 

like Naik, Dhobi, etc. too face a similar predicament.  These castes should also be 

granted the Scheduled Caste status.  So, much weightage should not be given to the 

interview for a job.  If the SC student has secured good marks in written exam, he 

should not be deliberately given less marks in the interview.
