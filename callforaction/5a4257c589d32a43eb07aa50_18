  There  is  a  shortage  of  21  per  cent  in  teaching 

faculty in the 20 IIMs.  These vacancies would increase in future.  So, whether the 

government  has  chalked  out  a  road  map  to  fill  these  vacancies  in  a  time  bound 

manner.    Besides,  whether  the  government  would  give  representation  to  each 

section  of  society  while  filling  these  vacancies.    I  also  want  to  know  from  the 

government  whether  there  would  be  a  common  entrance  examination  or  separate 

examination  for  admission  in  these  institutes.    At  the  same  time,  the  level  of  the 

paper  in  different  languages  should  also  be  the  same.    There  is  no  IIM  in 

Marathwada  region.    I,  therefore,  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  establish  an  IIM 

either in Aurangabad or Hingoli.  I also request that all these institutes should be 

provided a level playing field so that all the students get same  kind of placement.  

In  addition  to this, the  students belonging to  weaker  sections of  society  like  SCs, 

STs and OBCs should be given scholarship.
