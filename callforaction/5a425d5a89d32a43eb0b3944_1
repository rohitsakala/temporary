 We all know that the birth of this Bill 

took place because the Supreme Court asked the Government to review the salaries 

and pensions of the Supreme Court judges. We all know that our judiciary is under 

tremendous strain.  There is no doubt that judges should be very well paid.  That is 

the only way you can stop all these rumours and claims that are circulating in the 

open society today that our judges are corrupt.  As far as I understand this Bill is 

slightly complex.  There are two streams through which people are coming up  as 

judges.  One is from the subordinate judiciary.  There are other judges who come 

up  because  of  certain  other  abilities.      This  Bill  tries  to  equate  a  judge  with  that 

judge  who has come up from the grind instead, adding ten years as bonus service 

period  for  that  Judge  who  has  not  come  through  the  grind.    This,  is  unequal  and 

unjust. The post of Chief Justice is transferable across the States - the Government 

should take up the responsibility of his pension liability.  They do not have a State 

cadre.  While they are in service, the salaries can be paid for by the relevant States 

but their pension should be borne by the Central Government.  In all the 24 High 

Courts in  the  country  have 44.5 lakh  pending  cases.   The lower  courts across the 

country have 2.4 crore pending cases.  Subordinate judiciary in this country  must 

be strengthened.  A case filed against a family destroys the whole family; destroys 

the peace; destroys their economy.  This happens only in India because of justice 

delivery system has collapsed at the lower level.
