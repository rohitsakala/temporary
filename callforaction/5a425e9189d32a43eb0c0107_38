    Housing,  a  basic  need  for  humans,  could 

play  an  important  role  in  accommodating  high  urban  growth  in  India.    With  more 

than  one  crore  population  getting  added  to  urban  areas,  India's  urban  population  is 

expected to reach about 81 crore by 2050.  As per studies conducted by the Ministry 

of Rural Development and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, 

it  is  estimated  that  almost  a  quarter  of  Indian  households  lack  adequate  housing 

facility.    The  revised  estimate  for  the  year  2015-16  was  reported  as  236.4  crore 

rupees  which  is  significantly  lesser  than  the  budgeted  estimate  for  housing  for  the 

same  year  i.e.  563.43  crore  rupees.    I  would  urge  the  government  to  look  into  the 

reasons  for  the  significantly  lower  revised  budget  estimates  for  the  year  2015-16.  

The need of the hour is to strengthen the ULBs. As of now most of the Solid Waste 

are  going  into  land  fill  sites  without  any  treatment.    Therefore,  special  interest  in 

case of Solid Waste Management is the need of the hour.
