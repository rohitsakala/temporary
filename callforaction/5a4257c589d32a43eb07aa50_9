  The  hon.  Minister  has  taken  initiative 

to  make  each  of  the  20  Indian  Institutes  of  Management  as  institutes  of  national 

importance and to empower them grant degrees to students.  It is really the need of 

the hour.  The Bill bestows more autonomy than what the IIMs currently enjoy.  I 

would like to congratulate the hon. Minister for this initiative.  The Bill only has a 

vague  enabling  provision  on  faculty  reservation.    While  the  proposed  law 

categorically states that IIMs will have to provide reservation for SC/ST and OBC 

students, it has a clause which only says that IIMs shall try to recruit teachers from 

weaker  sections  of  society.    The  Bill  is  highlighting  only  IIMs  not  the  other 

institutes,  which  is  a  matter  of  concern.    Currently,  setting  up  an  educational 

institute 

requires  affiliation,  approval,  No  Objection  Certificate 

(NOC), 

permission, recognition, etc.   This is  a unique opportunity  for  the  Government to 

bring  in  procedural  reforms  in  setting  up  of  new  management  institutes.    The 

Government  should 

facilitate  practical  business 

internship  during  MBA 

programmes  with  local  Indian  and  foreign  companies  for  students.    A  difficult 

entrance  exam  must  be  created  for  individuals  to  become  full  time  MBA  faculty 

and then must be paid well.
