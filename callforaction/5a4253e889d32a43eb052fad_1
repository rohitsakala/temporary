 One hon. Member mentioned that if we 

put juveniles in jails meant for adults then 10, 15 or 20 years after their release they 

would  certainly  become  criminals.    Why  are  children  getting  involved  in  such 

heinous crimes?  The main reason is that in juvenile reform homes and shelters the 

juveniles are victims of homosexuality, sexual harassment and indecency.  I am not 

against the bill.  As per a survey, out of 33 thousand incidents in Delhi in the past 

few  years  minors  were  involved  in  25    thousand.    Out  of  these  one  thousand 

incidents  involved  children  in  the  age  group  of  7  to  12  years  old.    About  11-12 

thousand incidents involved children in the age group 12-16 years.  Are we going 

to consider 7 to 12 years old children in future as adults?  The need of the  hour is 

to  go  to  the  root  of  this  problem.    Why  is  it  that  percentage  of  such  children 

belonging to slum areas is more?  Children openly take drugs on the streets.  Police 

openly  takes  Hafta  from  them.   There  is no  provision in our law  to prevent them 

from  committing  the  crime.    I  feel  we  are  all  guilty  including  those  running 

juvenile reform homes.  The need of the hour is to divert the energy of the growing 

children.    Another  factor  is  that  their  means  of  entertainment  is  very  limited  and 

the  only  thing  that  easily  attracts  them  is  crime.    Why  can't  we  bring  some 

amendments to ensure that their attention is diverted of crimes.  Mere provision of 

punishment  will  not  control  the  crime.    It  is  very  essential  that  sports  be  made 

compulsory  in  schools.    Regarding  the  children  my  conscience  says  that  if  they 

have  not  committed  any  heinous  crime  they  should  be  pardoned  and  given  a 

chance to lead a normal life.  Children should be kept in the juvenile reform homes 

until their crime is established.
