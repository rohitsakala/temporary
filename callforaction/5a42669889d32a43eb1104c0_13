 The last amendment to both the eligibility 

limit and calculating ceilings under the said Act was carried out in the year 2007 

and  was  made  effective  from  1st  April, 2006.    The  Central  Government  has  been 

receiving  representations    from  trade  unions, individuals  and  various  associations 

for enhancement or for removal of the above ceilings.  Since, the section 38 does 

not  provide  for  the  previous  publication  of  the  rules,  it  is  proposed  to  insert  an 

enabling  provision  providing  for  previous  publication  for  the  purpose  of  inviting 

objections and suggestions in tune with the other legislations pertaining to welfare 

of labour.
