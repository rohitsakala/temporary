    We  are  supporting  this  Bill  but  we  have 

some  suggestions  and  some  requests.   There  are still  some  major  concerns  of the 

State that have not been appropriately addressed.  So far as the GST compensation 

is concerned, it was unanimously agreed that the State should be compensated by 

the Government of India for loss of revenue for at least five years.  We are strongly 

of  the  view  that  this  should  be  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  itself.    Goods  and 

service  tax  should  not  be  levied  on  petroleum  crude,  high  speed  diesel,  petrol, 

natural gas, and aviation turbine fuel at least in the initial period as presently these 

items  are  taxed  at  higher  rates  and  constitute  a  major  source  of  revenue  for  the 

States.  The States should be allowed to impose sales tax over and above GST on 

tobacco and tobacco products.  Since the revenue of the States will depend on the 

inter-state transactions, they must have the authority to verify the transactions. So, 

for  providing  a  legal  framework,  it  is  absolutely  necessary  that  the  relevant 

enabling  clause  should  be  added  to  the  proposed  Article  269A  as  was  earlier 

recommended by the Empowered Committee.  I would like to emphasis that GST 

can  only  succeed  provided  the  States  are  financially  strong.    This  is  particularly 

important to keep the federal structure intact and empower the States to effectively 

meet their development and infrastructural responsibilities.
