  I support the Bills with a lot of reservations 

and  a  heavy  heart.    I  think  that  the  GST  basically  is  a  transgression  into  the 

powers  of  the  Parliament  when  we  are  giving  our  taxing  powers  to  a  GST 

Council, which does not have a representative character. The States will have no 

freedom  to  decide  on  the  rates  at  which  they  choose  to  tax  commodities.  We 

have to see that the States' fiscal condition does not deteriorate.  How will the 

compensation to the States be worked out?  Where would the money come from 

to compensate the State? That has not been made clear in this. Let me mention 

clearly that the Centre seems to be in a hurry.  Till now, the Government has not 

fixed up the rates.  It has fixed the basic rates.  But what is the rate of individual 

commodities?  Now, there will be a problem of fitment.  These basic questions 

have not been resolved.  The business is totally unprepared for GST. What will 

the small businesses do?  The biggest problem of the GST is the GST Network 

(GSTN).    It  will  be  a  technological  nightmare.    You  have  to  train  the 

businessmen in all the States for the job. So, instead of hurrying, let us put the 

systems  in  place.    Lastly,  prices  should  not  increase  in  this  year  of  transition.  

But prices may increase and that has to be taken care of.
