  We  welcome 

the  Election  Laws 

(Amendment) Bill, 2016.  This is a consequential result of the 119th Constitution 

(Amendment)  Bill  2013.      Through  this  persons  who  have  opted  to  acquire  or 

retain Indian citizenship will get their most cherished and fundamental right to be a 

voter and cast their votes and to elect their Government.  There was an assurance 

given by the Central Government to the State of West Bengal that for the purpose 

of rehabilitation of these persons, financial assistance would be given to the State 

of West Bengal.  An amount was also set but unfortunately, the entire amount has 

not  yet  reached.    Very  little  amount  has  gone  there  for  rehabilitation.    Their 

rehabilitation  is  also  very  necessary.    We  will  appreciate  more  if  the  hon.  Law 

Minister immediately take steps for releasing the balance financial assistance to the 

State of West Bengal so that those people can cast their votes.
