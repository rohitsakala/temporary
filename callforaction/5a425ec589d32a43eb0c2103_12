  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Government 

for opening bank accounts of 23 crore poor people of this country under the Jan-

Dhan  Yojana.    I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  government  that  it  has  issued  debit 

cards keeping in view the needs of poor people wherein poor people is entitled to 

get  a  loan  of  Rs.4000  which  is  a  historical  step.    I  would  like  to  request  the 

government  to  increase  this  amount  to  Rs.25000.    The  Government  has  also 

launched a scheme for poor people under the MUDRA Yojana to make them self 

reliant.    It  is  my  demand  that  the  amount  given  under  this  scheme  should  be 

increased from Rs.  50 thousand to Rs. One lakh.  In addition to that, government 

has issued an instruction to all the banks to grant loan upto Rs. One crore for the 

empowerment of Scheduled Caste and women of this country.  Besides, provision 

should be made with regard to the promotion of all the bank officials based on loan 

disbursal.  I would also like to submit that the amount of Rs. 520 crore  under the 

StandUp  Yojana  is  very  meager  and  it  should  be  increased  to  at  least  Rs.  20 

thousand crore.  There is a need to put some mechanism in place and make laws to 

monitor  the  funds  sanctioned  for  the  welfare  of  Schedule  Castes  and  Scheduled 

Tribes.  In addition to that, amount should be increased under the Pradhan Mantri 

Awas  Yojana  for  the  benefit  of  the  poor  people  of  our  country.    Lastly,  I  would 

also like to draw the attention of the Government towards the increasing  cases of 

corruption committed by various trusts.
