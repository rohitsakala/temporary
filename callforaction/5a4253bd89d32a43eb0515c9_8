 This Bill has been able to draw the support of all 

the  people  as  it  serves  the  interests  of  the  country  and  the  human  being  as  well.  

This  Bill  has  been  introduced  on  the  lines  of  Protocol  Supplementary  Beijing 

Convention which provides for the punishment from life time imprisonment to the 

death  penalty.    I  would  also  like  to  say  that  it  was  necessary  to  bring  about  such 

changes  in  the  Act  to  tackle  the  threat  of  terrorism  that  our  country  is  facing  at 

present.    We  should  bear  it  also  in  our  mind  the  plane  highjack  is  likely  to  be 

carried out even through the use of electronic technology. Hence, measures should 

also be taken accordingly.  In the case of plane highjack compensation should be 

provided to all the passengers of the plane without  making any discrimination on 

the basis of their country.
