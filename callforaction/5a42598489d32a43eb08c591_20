 The Gross Enrolment Ratio is 

considered  as  a  parameter  of  growth  in  education.    The  present  Gross  Enrolment 

Ratio  is  18  per  cent  and  the  Government  is  trying  to  reach  to  30  per  cent.  

Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan is aimed to increase the Enrolment Ratio in 

higher education.  But the Government has reduced the allocation to RUSA as well 

as  UGC.    The  projected  demand  for  NITs  was  Rs.3,000  crore  but  here  also  the 

Government  has  slashed  the  funds  to  the  tune  of  Rs.1,444.90  crore.    There  is  a 

severe  shortage  of  faculty  which  is  seriously  affecting  the  quality  of  education.  

Only six per cent of our population between the age of 16 to 23 used to obtain the 

higher  education  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  we  have  developed  a  lot  in  terms  of 

number  of  universities  and  colleges.    We  are  still  spending  only  1.12  per  cent  of 

our  GDP  on  education.    Our  syllabus  should  be  upgraded.    I  would  also  suggest 

you to explore a symbiotic relation between the production of our engineers or our 

MBA and their placement in various jobs.  About 93 per cent of our Management 

Bachelors are jobless and 80 per cent of our engineers are jobless.
