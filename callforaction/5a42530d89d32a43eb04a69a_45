 This year's budget underscores the fact that 

this Government has really been working for the villagers, poor and farmers.  The 

increase  in  the  growth  rate  of  agriculture  from  a  rate  of  two  per  cent  of  previous 

year  to  the  4.1  per  cent  this  year  is  indicative  of  the  fact  as  to  how  serious  the 

government  is  for  the  welfare  of  the  farmers  and  agriculture  sector.    The 

government is committed to the cause of bringing about white revolution as well as 

blue revolution in the country in addition to the green revolution.  The budgetary 

allocation for agriculture which was Rs. 44250 crore in the year 2016-17 has been 

increased by 15.31 per cent to make it Rs. 51,026 crore.  Ensuring the availability 

of 100 per cent quantity of Neem coated Urea is a welcome step.  The areas in my 

constituency  Bhagnagar  and  Botad    are  predominantly  agricultural  areas  where  a 

majority of the people are dependent upon agriculture for their livelihood.  There is 

a need to open another Krishi Vigyan Kendra here.
