    This  Bill  is  going  to  be  a  very 

revolutionary one in terms of making available crores of skilled manpower.  There 

is  an  urgent  need  to  provide  support  to  the  8-10  crore  people  engaged  in  this 

profession  particularly  belonging  to  dalit  community.    The  raw  material  is  

available  in  abundance  in  our  country.  The  soldiers  of  our  country  need  best 

quality jackets and shoes so that they could valiantly combat the enemy at places 

such  as  Aksai  Chin  glacier.    India  can  grab  a  large  world  market  in  the  field  of 

leather.  I hope that the institution set up after passing this Bill will provide quality 

education  of  highest  standard  to  bring  about  a  revolutionary  change  in  footwear 

design  and  development  institutions  and  competing  in  the  environment  of  global 

competition, we  would  be  able  to  fulfill  the  resolve  of  Make in  India  of  our hon. 

Prime  Minister  and  succeed  in    export  of  footwear  from  our  country.    The  dalit 

community of our country wants to learn such a skill  and craft so that they could 

become  the  job givers instead of  job  seekers. This  will be  a  revolutionary  step in 

this direction.
