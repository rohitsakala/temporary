 

  I  rise  to  support  the  Atomic  Energy 

(Amendment)  Bill,  2015.    I  am  of  the  view  that  this  Bill  will  go  a  long  way  in 

making  big  contribution  in  the  field  of  nuclear  power  generation  in  the  country.  

When we talk about energy then we have to take rapid stride in the field of power 

generation  from  whatever  source  we  get  scope  to  produce  it  whether  it  is 

hydropower, green energy like solar power or whether it is through uranium.  The 

people  who  have  been  displaced  due  to  setting  up  of  the  Tarapur  Nuclear  power 

plant have still been suffering a lot.  Those people should be given accommodation 

facility and they should be given compensation for their land.  The field of power 

generation  also  assumes  great  importance  from  the  view  point  of  providing 

employment  to  our  youth.    Therefore,  we  have  to  work  very  fast  in  the  field  of 

power generation.
