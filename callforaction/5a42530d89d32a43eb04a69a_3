  Farmer  community  are  definitely 

going  to  be  benefited  from  the  provisions  made  in  the  budget  2017-18  regarding  

agricultural credit to the tune of Rs.10 lakh crore.  In addition to that, loan waiver 

scheme will also provide relief to the farmers. Similarly, budget provisions to the  

tune of Rs.9,000 crore have been made under the Crop Insurance Scheme.  I would 

like  to  request  the  Government  that    Agro-veg  industries  should  be  set  up  on 

district  basis.    In  my  Parliamentary  Consistency,  Amreli,  compensation  for  the 

crop  damage  due  to  neelgai  should  be  made  under  the  Crop  Insurance  Scheme.  

Apart from that, I would also request to allot more funds for agricultural research.  

Endeavours  should  be  made  to  promote  acqua  culture  in  the  rivers  after  rainy 

season.  In addition to that, there is also need to put emphasis on irrigation through 

ground water.  I would like to request that a monitoring mechanism should be put 

in a place with regard to the use of pesticides and fertilizers.
