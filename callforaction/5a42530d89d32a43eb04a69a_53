 I support the proposals with regard to the 

ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare for the year 2017-18.  In my Lok Sabha 

constituency  of  Lakhimpur  Khiri(Uttar  Pradesh),  there  is  much  forest  area 

bordering  which  there  are  a  number  of  villages  where  villagers  carry  out 

cultivation on their agricultural land.  A provision should be made to compensate 

the loss of crops by wild animals in the present crop insurance scheme.
