  I  support  this  legislation.    I  wish  to  place  on 

record the following suggestions.  There should be a district level forum which will 

help  small  and  mid-level  allottees.    The  constitution  of  the  Appellate  Tribunal 

under  Chapter  VII  should  compulsorily  have  one  Technical  Member.    The 

promoters  should  ensure  that  no  sub-standard  materials  are  used  as  against  high 

quality  materials  and  the  promoters  should  be  liable  to  pay  compensation.  

Regarding  non-completion  if  the  promoters  are  unable  to  give  possession  of  the 

apartment/flat/building  within  the  contractual  period,  the  promoter  should  be 

blacklisted.   The  compensation should be  at least 10  per  cent  over  and  above  the 

housing  loans  of  banks  and  financial  institutions.    There  should  be  a  proper 

garbage disposal and waste management option within the housing complex.  Floor 

or roof heights are decreasing day by day.  Such kind of a low height is not healthy 

in terms of air circulation and other issues.  There should be a minimum height of 

at least 12-13 feet.  My humble submission is that the proposed law much strike a 

balance so that it does not kill the investment in this sector.
