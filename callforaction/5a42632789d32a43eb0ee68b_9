  We  are  talking  about  these  institutions  at  a  time 

when  this  industry  is  going  through  a  major  crisis.    Everywhere  there  are 

retrenchments  in  the  IT  industry.    I  doubt  whether  these  Indian  Institutes  of 

Information Technology which are intended for IT will have any future because the 

content  of information  technology  always  has a  short shelf life.    Therefore, I  am  of 

the  strong opinion, there should be an intensive training on  the  robotics  or  artificial 

intelligence.    These  are  the  ones  which  definitely  have  an  edge  over  the  routine 

information  technology.  Therefore,  robotics,  artificial  intelligence,  divergent  and 

unconventional things of IT industry should also be a part of this curriculum.  Instead 

of  making IT  industry  a  job  seeker, let  us  make  it as entrepreneurs so that  they  can 

provide jobs to the youth.  We should always remember IT industry as a revolution.  

In Kakinada an IIIT was inaugurated five year back.  It has just stopped there only.  I 

would  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  look  into  the  matter  as  to  why  this  has  been 

stopped and request him to rejuvenate it.  I would request him to give top priority to 

new things allotted to Andhra Pradesh and give some academic importance to Andhra 

Pradesh on the Indian map.
