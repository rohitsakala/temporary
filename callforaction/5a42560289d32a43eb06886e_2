 I would particularly like to comment 

on the fact that irrespective of the party in power, none has addressed the farmers' 

problems. Natural calamities are other major problems for farmers. 320 districts of 

the nation are suffering from severe drought. Insurance schemes have also failed to 

protect farmers' interest. In this regard I would like to know the Government's view 

regarding Dr. Swaminathan's recommendation of providing MSP plus 50 per cent 

beneficiary price to the farmers on agricultural products. The Central Government 

last month decided to extend a loan package of Rs.  6,000 crore to sugar mills to 

help  clear  sugarcane  arrears.  But  the  package  failed  to  enthuse  the  industry.  I 

would  like  to  know  the  Government's  view  regarding  the  Rangarajan  Panel's 

linkage  formulae. I  would also like to  add  that  import  of sugar  should be banned 

and  duty  should  be  hiked  to  40  percent  immediately.  It  is  desirable  to  have  a 

packaging  policy  integrated  with  the  export  policy  of  India  to  ensure  that  all 

packaging  of  sugar  is  done  using  jute  and  other  environment-friendly  material.  I, 

on behalf of my party, extend my whole-hearted support to this Bill.
