 Most of the illicit money is having its roots in the real 

estate  sector.    This  definition  of  'allottee'  in  Clause  2(c)  of  the  Bill  may  be 

improved.  Why should there be a discrepancy or a difference between 500 square 

meters  and  above  500  square  meters?    If  any  of  the  realtors  are  making  any 

difference or showing any discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, religion, food 

habits, skin colour, race etc.  it should be punished because it is an illegal act.  I am 

supporting  this  Bill.    The  delay  does  not  happen  because  of  any  of  the  acts  or 

misdeeds on the part of the consumer, it is all on the part of the developers.  The 

rights  of  the  people  should  be  preserved.    I  think,  the  Minister  should  add  some 

more teeth to this Bill.
