  I  also  take  this  opportunity  to 

congratulate  the  hon.  Minister  for  bringing  a  good  Bill  to  protect  the  academic 

standards  in  our  Indian  Institutes  of  Managements  in  the  country.    The  sole 

purpose  of  this  Bill  is  to  give  effects  to  a  statutory  recognition  and  also  to  give 

autonomous  status  to  the  higher  educational  institutions  in  the  country.    I  would 

like to suggest that Government have to strive in such a way that India becomes the 

best destination  for  having  higher  education  and  quality  education.   I have  sound 

reasonable  apprehension  about  Clause  9(2),  which  says    that  every  institute  shall 

strive  to  raise  funds  for  self-sufficiency  and  sustainability.    As  regards  fee 

determination,  I  would  urge  upon  the  hon.  Minister  to  take  this  aspect  into 

consideration because  higher  fees  means  that  the  poor  and  common  students  will 

be  denied  the  right  to  have  access  to  higher  educational  institutions  like  Indian 

Institutes  of  Management  in  our  country.    You  kindly  understand  my  point  with 

regard  to  Clause  10.    The  governing  body  or  the  Board  of  Governors  is  the 

executive  body  of  the  Institute  and  the  Board  will  consist  of  the  Chairperson 

nominated  or  appointed  by  the  Board.    Except  the  Central  Government 

representative  and  the  State  Government  representative,  all  other  representatives 

are being nominated by the Board.  So, at least, convince this House as to how this 

Board  is  going  to  be  constituted.    As  regards  receiving  donations  and  gifts  from 

foreign countries, it has to be restricted and some condition should be there.
