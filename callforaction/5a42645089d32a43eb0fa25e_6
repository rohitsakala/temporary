 I would request the hon. Minister to visit some of the 

Government  schools  as  well  as  aided  schools  without  giving  prior  notice.    We 

should  interact  with  the  children  and  invite  their  suggestions  before  making  law 

here.  This Bill intends to provide that every teacher appointed or in position as on 

31st March, 2015 who does not possess minimum qualifications shall acquire such 

minimum  qualifications  within  a  period  of  four  years  from  the  date  of 

commencement  of  the  proposed  legislation.    My  humble  submission  to  the 

Minister  is  that  please  do  not  extend  this  cutoff  date  any  further.    The  Right  to 

Education itself will not work.  Nutritional standards of the students, the children, 

the  infants  is  also  not  upto  the  mark.    Our  hon.  Members  chairing  the  DISHA 

should  visit  the  Mid-day  Meal  Programme  that  is  when  food  is  being  served  in 

Government schools and aided schools.  Lakhs and lakhs of children are coming to 

schools  with  an  empty  stomach  and  they  cannot  learn  with  an  empty  stomach.  

Nowadays,  education  has  become  a  business  without  any  ethics.    We  have  to 

ensure  good  education.    Good  education  means  increasing  the  human  quality.  

Many  schools  do  not  have  even  playground.    The  successive  Governments  have 

not  fulfilled  the  promises  or  the  constitutional  obligation  of  free  and  compulsory 

education.  There should be a thorough discussion on how to increase the standard 

of  education  and  what  we  can  do  not  only  regarding  the  enrolment  ratio  but  also 

the dropout ratio.  My request to the Minister is to have a separate budget for HRD.  

Again  and  again,  the  recurring  expenditure  is  coming  and  it  is  being  put  on  the 

shoulders of the State Governments.
