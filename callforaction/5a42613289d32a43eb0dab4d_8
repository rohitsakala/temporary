 I would like to inform that nearly 30 per cent of the 

SC and ST population is spread over in this country.  Only 15 per cent reservation 

is  there  for  SCs  and  7.5  per  cent  is  there  for  STs.    Without  increasing  the 

percentage,  if  a  community  include  in  the  list,  then  it  is  a  burden  on  the  existing 

communities.    Hence,  enhance  the  reservation  percentage  also.    There  is  a  hitch 

here  as  regards  Supreme  Court  that  50  per  cent  should  not  be  crossed.    The 

government  can  promulgate  an  Ordinance  and  can  exceed  50  per  cent  because 

Parliament is supreme.
