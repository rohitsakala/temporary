 This Bill seems to be a very 

good one.  We should promote shipping and navigation.  The objective of this Bill 

is  to  reduce  the  cost  of  transportation  as  also  the  risk  of  accidents  on  National 

Highways.  This would also boost tourism.  Bihar is a backward State.  I, therefore, 

request the hon. Minister to take care of Bihar in this regard.  The Sultanganj ghat 

in Bhagalpur should be given the status of a port.  I also request the hon. Minister 

to construct more National Highways in the State.
