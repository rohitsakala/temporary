  The Right to Education is a serious subject.  

There  is  shortage  of  teachers  in  every  state.      About  14000  posts  of  teachers  are 

lying vacant in Punjab.  There are various reasons for drop out in education.  There 

are  some  social  reasons  also.    The  gap  between  a  primary  school  and  a  middle 

school is about 7-8 kms.  There should be a shuttle service or bus service for such 

schools.    Teachers  are  deployed  for  works  relating  to  voting  and  census.    The 

students  are  studying  in  unsafe  buildings.    I  would  like  that  quality  of  education 

should be improved.
