 Today we are discussing the Sikh Gurudwara 

(Amendment) Bill.  I question its timing.  Some people have mixed religion with 

politics.  When we go to pray, nobody stops us but we are not allowed to vote.  I 

want that everyone who considers the Guru Granth Sahib the Guru and goes to the 

Gurudwara  for  prayer  should  be  allowed  to  exercise  his  franchise  to  elect 

Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee.
