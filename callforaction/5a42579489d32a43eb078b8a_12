  The  taxation  policy  of  the  Government  is 

not protecting the citizens.  The biggest sufferers of this Government policy are the 

powerloom sectors of Malegaon, Bhiwandi, Varanasi and Surat.  The Government 

has imposed anti-dumping duties on synthetic yarn imported from China and this is 

benefitting only a handful of corporates.  This is not benefitting powerloom sector 

of Malegaon or Bhiwandi.  On the other hand export of cotton has come down by 

23 per cent.  This is falling because of cheap clothes being exported by Pakistan, 

Bangladesh  and  Sri  Lanka.    I  request  the  Government  to  withdraw  the  anti-

dumping  duty  imposed  on  synthetic  yarn  and  polyester  partially  oriented  yarn 

(POY) being imported from China.  I would also request the Government to come 

to the rescue of power loom industry of Malegaon, Bhiwandi, Surat and Varanasi.
