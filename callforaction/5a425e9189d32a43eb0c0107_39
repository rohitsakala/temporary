    Hon'ble  Prime  Minister  has  taken  a 

decision that all the scheme formulated by the Government would be implemented. 

Our Government has a plan to built smart cities. The Government is also planning to 

formulate Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Provision in the Budget has been made to 

provide  House  to  poor  people.  Under  the  MUDRA  Scheme  poor  families  can  get 

engaged  in  small  scale  entrepreneurship.  I  demand  that  Pradhan  Mantri  Awas 

Yojana  should  also  be  implemented  in  rural  areas  of  Gujarat  so  that  villages  and 

municipalities also reap benefit of the scheme.
