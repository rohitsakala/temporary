  The  Bill  has  been  drafted  to 

safeguard  the  rights  of  the  people  affected  by  HIV,  address  HIV  related 

discrimination  and  strengthening  the  existing  programme  by  bringing  in  legal 

accountability.  After this Bill becomes law, no HIV person can be treated unfairly 

to  live  his  day-to-day  life  whether  at  work  or  educational  institutes  or  public  or 

private offices.  But at the same time, pre-marital HIV counseling should be made 

mandatory  so  that  we  can,  in  future,  save  not  one  life,  but  two  lives  -  life  of  the 

partner  as  well  as  of  the  child.    This  ART  should  be  made  available  to  each  and 

every  HIV  infected  person.    The  life  threatening  infections/conditions  related  to 

HIV  should  be  covered,  and  treatment  should  be  given  free  of  cost  including 

treatment of tuberculosis and hepatitis.  We should also try to give social security 

and  social  rehabilitation  to  the  HIV  infected  persons.    This  should  also  be 

considered in the Bill.
