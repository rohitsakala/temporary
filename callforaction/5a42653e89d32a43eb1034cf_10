  Maharashtra  has  been  one  of  the  most 

forthcoming and progressive States.  We are also one of the  manufacturing States 

and we also have concerns.  I want to clear this right at the beginning that we are 

not  against  GST.    There  are  only  a  few  clarifications  that  I  will  ask  the  hon. 

Finance Minister to make so that we feel reassured because this entire Bill is very 

Centre-oriented.    Are  we  sure  that  in  11  months  all  States  will  be  on  par  in  an 

administrative  matter  of  implementation?    A  lot  of  people  have  talked  about 

revenue-neutral rate, which is definitely a concern.  We are all happy to pay taxes, 

but if they are going to be at a ridiculous rate of 27 per cent it will bring hardship.  

I would urge the hon. Minister to look for solutions, and if he can bring it down.  If 

you really want to bring more people into the tax net, then it has to be a realistic 

number.  What GST benchmark the Government going to look at?  So, I would ask 

the hon. Minister to clarify this.  Another query, which we are concerned about is 

dual authority.  What is going to be the benchmark of dual taxation:  So, we would 

like  the  hon.  Minister  to  clarify  about  it  because  we  do  not  want  dual  authority.  

Let the States take a certain level, and above that let the Centre take over.  But our 

State's recommendation should be respected, and that is all that we are urging for.
