  The  Bill  is  silent  whether  the 

institute  will  have  to  implement  reservation  for  SC,ST  and  OBC  in  faculty 

recruitment.    That  needs  to  be  clarified.    I  would  draw  the  attention  of  the  hon. 

Minister that out of 15 lakh engineering graduates coming out every year, just about 

10  per  cent  graduates  are  employable.    As  per  Mckinsey  Report  by  2025,  14  lakh 

middle  level  work  force  in  IT  industry  accounting  for  45  per  cent of  the  total  work 

force as of now will face an uncertain future.  There is clash about anti-outsourcing in 

America and Europe.  Keeping the prevailing circumstances in mind the Government 

will have to work with a new mindset.
