  In  the  earlier  amendments, 

warehouse was not incorporated in the definition of 'custom area' which resulted in 

many difficulties.  But, from now on there would be no problem to the importers.  

Secondly,  a  new  section  108(1)  has  been  incorporated  in  the  Customs  Act  about 

which apprehension has been made to this effect that definition of 'proper officer' 

has  not  been  provided  in  this  section.    In  this  regard,  I  would  like  to  clarify  that 

definition of 'proper officer' has been made in the sub-section 34 of section 2 in the 

Customs  Act  wherein  he  has  been  conferred  the  powers  to  seek  the  details.    In 

addition  to  that,  he  has  also  power  to  impose  penalty  for  concealing  the  facts 

deliberately  and  also  to  prosecute  for  providing  wrong  information.    Similarly, 

government  department  also  make  delay  in  providing  information  so  this 

amendment  was  very  necessary  to  curb  this  trend.    Similarly,  four  or  five  cesses 

have  been  done  away  with  through  the  enactment.    It  is  estimated  that  in  the 

coming  years,  actual  tax  receipt  would  increase  because  GST  is  going  to  be 

implemented with effect from 1st of July.  Through you I would like to request the 

government that problems pertaining to small traders should also be resolved.
