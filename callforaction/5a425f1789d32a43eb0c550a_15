  The  concept  of  one  country-one 

market-one  tax  is  going  to  be  realized  today.    GST  is  an  effort  to  ensure 

reaching  to  the  people.    This  has  been  done  for  the  sake  of  cooperative 

federalism.  To ensure that no state remains behind in this economic system, the 

smaller  states  have  been  given  exemption  for  five  years.    We  are  getting  over 

VAT and all other artificial barriers which were creating so many problems and 

compliance issues.  To  take this  young  country  ahead, the government  intends 

to connect it with Startup India, Standup India and Digital India.  GST will curb 

tax  terrorism  and  facilitate  business  by  the  people  as  per  their  convenience.  

Today, we are the sixth economy in the world.  We have to bring it among the 

first  three  so  that  the  dream  of  our  hon.  Prime  Minister  could  be  realized  that 

every  youth,  every  person  residing  in  this  country  could  live  with  dignity  and 

strength.    The  GST  intends  to  bring  everybody  under  that  umbrella.    Our 

country  needs  investment.    Investment  will  increase  jobs,  infrastructure  and 

GST will remove corruption.  As such, we should jointly support the GST.  The 

GST  is  like  changing  the  track  of  the  economy  which  will  take  the  economy 

ahead.
