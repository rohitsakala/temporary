  The  farmers  of  my  parliamentary 

constituency are small farmers who have less than one hectare of land.  The hon. 

Finance  Minister  has  allocated  Rs.  five  thousand  crore  for  the  Sinchai  Yojana.  

Small  irrigation  projects  should  be  undertaken  out  of  this  fund  to  ameliorate  the 

condition of the farmers in order to bring happiness and prosperity in their life.  In 

my  parliamentary  constituency,  there  is  a  major  irrigation  project  named  Moran 

Ganjal which is pending for want of environmental clearance.  Once this project is 

completed, 10 lakh 4 thousand and 1 hundred 35 acres of land would be irrigated 

and 211 villages would get potable water.  If this project is granted environmental 

clearance  then  this  would  definitely  be  helpful  in  improving  the  condition  of  my 

constituency.  Besides, the support price for farmers produce like Gram  Arhar and 

Mong  should  be  also  increased.    The  crops  of  farmers  in  my  constituency  is 

destroyed by pigs if their crops is saved from pigs then it would give a big relief to 

farmers.
