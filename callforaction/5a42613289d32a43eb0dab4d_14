 There are two reasons for the plight of 

dalits  in  this  country-  first  is  Brahminism  and  second  is  capitalism.    To  remove 

discrimination  with  the  dalits  and  ensure  their  uplift,  Baba  Saheb  Bhimrao 

Ambedkar  had  given  a  clarion  call  of  'be  educated,  be  connected  and  carry  on 

struggle'.  Why those who talk about meritocracy, do not raise their voice against 

the  duffer  elite  who  become  doctor,  engineer,  everything  without  qualifying.    If 

casteism,  discrimination  has  to  be  removed  from  India,  there  is  just  one  way  of 

providing higher education for the dalits.
