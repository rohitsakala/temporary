  The  introduction  of  Value  Addition 

Tax  at  the  Centre  and  the  States  was  one  of  the  major  improvements  in  post-

Independence  India.  Customers  and  traders  are  all  being  burdened  with  so  many 

taxes. So, definitely it is the need of the hour that there should be a uniform pattern 

of tax structure not only in indirect tax sector but in direct tax sector also. GST is 

not  simply  a  VAT  plus  service  tax  but  it  is  an  improved  form  of  the  existing 

system of VAT. The first clarification I would like to have from the hon. Minister 

is regarding alcohol and petrol. The long pending demand of almost all the States 

is that alcohol and petrol should be exempted from the imposition of GST. But the 

73rd Committee Report stated that no goods should be constitutionally kept outside 

the purview of GST. The revenue concerns of the States have not been taken into 

consideration  in  respect  of  petrol.  I  appreciate  the  fact  that  alcohol  is  exempted. 

Similarly,  petrol  has  to  be  exempted  from  the  purview  of  GST.  I  urge  upon  the 

Government  for  devolution  of  net  proceeds  of  Integrated  GST  also  to  be  done 

through the Finance Commission, not by legislation by the Union Government.
