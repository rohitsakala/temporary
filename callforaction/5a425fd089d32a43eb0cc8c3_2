  This  is  another  major  of  the 

Government  in  the  direction  of  good  governance.    This  sector  provides  second 

largest  number  of  employment  opportunities  after  agriculture.    Approximately 

76000  domestic  and  foreign  companies  are  engaged  in  this  sector.    According  to 

this Bill, a developer will have to fulfill all the information given in advertisement.  

Rural areas and small towns are short of 70 per cent housing facilities whereas big 

cities have 30 per cent shortfall.  The Government has a dream of providing house 

to  all  by  the  year  2022.    We  need  5-6  crore  houses.    How  will  we  fund  it?    The 

investors  have  got  confidence  after  this  Bill.    If  FDI  comes  in,  certainly,  the 

employment opportunities will also grow.  Now the procedure will be simplified.  

There are lakhs of houses lying vacant in several cities.  Habitations often spread 

around  the  cities  on  cultivable  land.    Some  provision  for  saving  the  agricultural 

land  should  also  be  made  in  this  Bill.    It  should  also  be  taken  care  of  that  this 

Central legislation is not in confrontation with the state laws.  BPL people should 

get easy and affordable justice in the tribunal.
