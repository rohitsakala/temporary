  Footwear  Design  and  Development 

Institute was established in 1986.  The objective of this Institute was very clearly 

to  expand  the  activities  of  the  leather  industry.    The  campuses  were  setup  and, 

today,  we  have  seven  of  them  doing  extremely  well  from  the  point  of  view  of 

providing skills and a Diploma at the end of the course.  The courses are wide and 

varied.    I  would  like  to  state  that  Hon.  Members  consider  providing  institute  of 

national importance stature for this set of institutions.  Together with it, there are 

more  than  40  training  centres,  which  have  state-of-the-art  facility  in  training 

trainers  who  can  then  go  into  the  market  and  help  in  building  capacities.    It  was 

initially  running  courses  for  self  and  later  got  affiliated  to  the  Indira  Gandhi 

National Open University.  In 2012, for some reason, the Indira Gandhi  National 

Open  University  said  that  it  could  no  longer  provide  the  certification  and  the 

diplomas  for  these  students.    Mewar  University  in  Rajasthan  agreed  to  get  the 

FDDI associated.  Unfortunately, by 2014, the University Grants Commission said 

that  Mewar  University  which  was  located  in  Rajasthan,  could  at  best  only  deal 

with institutions which are located in Rajasthan and not certify courses which are 

being held in different institutions all over the country.  We have now realized that 

the  only  way  in  which  the  stature  of  the  institution  can  be  kept  up  and  also  the 

curriculum content could be maintained at the level, as it is, is by completely self-

financing set of courses and its function can be maintained by seeking Parliament's 

approval to give it the stature of the institute of national importance.
