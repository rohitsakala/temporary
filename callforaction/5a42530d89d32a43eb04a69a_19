  In  order  to  ensure  availability  of  new 

varieties  of  seeds  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural  Research  and  State  Agriculture 

Universities  and  Krishi  Vigyan  Kendras  are  setting  up  seed  centers.  Rs.  225.31 

crore has been allocated to set up 150 seed centers. I demand the Government that 

one seed center must be set up at least in one of the districts of Chatra, Latehar and 

Palamau.  It  will  facilitate  farmers  to  get  new  variety  of  seeds.  Rashtriya  Gokul 

Mssion has been launched to preserve bovine species, bovine breeding and Dairy 

Development.  I  request  the  Government  to  accord  approval  for  setting  up  one 

Gokul  Gram  for  extremism  hit  backward  district  Chatra  of  Jharkhand.  The 

production of fish rose to 205.59 lakh tons in 2016. Today India ranks first in the 

production  of  eggs.  Jharkhand  has  immense  potential  to  promote  fish  breeding.  I 

request  the  Government  to  cooperate  Jharkhand  in  the  area  of  fishery  and  egg 

production  so  that  adequate  avenues  of  employment  are  generated  in  poor,  tribal 

and  backward  areas  of  Jharkhand.  In  order  to  motivate  youth  to  attract  them  to 

agriculture and retain it, the Government has launched a scheme named Attracting 

and  Retaining  Youth  in  Agriculture  (ARYA).  Every  district  all  over  the  country 

should have at least one Krishi Vigyan Kendra.
