  I  am  sure  that  NPAs  are 

playing  a  predominant  role  in  the  way  of  socio-economic  development  and 

economic growth.  Therefore some mechanism has to be evolved either to realize 

them or to write them off or to infuse more money into the banking sector.  On the 

other hand bank people are insisting on security or margin money for small loans 

like MUDRA.  I request the Government that instructions may be given to banks 

and the instructions given by the Government should be displayed in each branch 

so  that  the  common  man  is  benefitted.    Again,    hon.  Finance  Minister  is  losing 

sight  of  the  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  (CSR).    Nearly  two  per  cent  of  the 

companies' profit should get into the society.  It will help in creating infrastructure 

in the housing sector in villages, drinking water, drainage system, community halls 

and  the  roads.    Again,  the  NREGA  money  which  has  to  go  to  the  poorest  of  the 

poor,  is  not  reaching  the  poor.    Therefore,  Government  should  insist  the  State 

Governments  to  spend  the  money  for  the  heads  for  which  it  is  given  so  that  the 

money is not diverted.
