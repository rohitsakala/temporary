    I  would  like  the  hon.  Minister  to 

clarify on two points.  Is nuclear power safe and is it cost effective.  When we talk 

about safety we have to look into the fact that we should not set up nuclear power 

plants  in  those  areas  which  are  heavily  populated  and  those  which  are  prone  to 

natural disaster.   The  nuclear  power plant  of  at village  Gorakhpur is  lying  within 

the radius of 100 kilometers of one of the most earthquake prone belt of Kangra.  I 

would  request the hon. Minister that  he should  conduct  a  study  as  to  whether  the 

proposed plant in that area will be safe or not.  We should deploy the professional 

people of Indian origin for taking care of the safety aspect of nuclear power plants.  

Thorium  is  found  in  abundance  in  our  country.    When  we  talk  about  nuclear 

research, are we conducting research on thorium as well?  Are we looking towards 

proper  utilization  of  thorium  so  that  we  do  not  become  dependent  on  foreign 

countries.
