  Like  many  of  my  other 

colleagues,  I  also  congratulate  the  hon.  Minister  for  bringing  out  a  wonderful 

legislation.    In  fact,  we  believe  that  prevention  is  better  than  cure.    The  more 

vulnerable  group  is  women  and  children  who  need  a  special  focus.    We  do  not 

have comprehensive coordinative efforts on part of the State Governments and the 

Central  Government.    This  only  can  result  in  effective  control  of  the  disease.    I 

think  we  have  to  give  special  attention  to  the  female  sex  workers,  particularly  at 

few places like Mumbai and Kolkata. We need to have a special programme, both 

in  terms  of  awareness  and  treatment,  for  them.  Denial  either  for  the  treatment  or 

for  other  things  should  also  be  made  a  criminal  offence.    Instead  of  putting  the 

responsibility  of  ombudsman  on  to  the  State  Governments,  the  Government  of 

India  should  take  its  responsibility.    At  least  in  big  establishments  having  more 

than  100  people,  some  incentive  may  be  given  to  the  companies  which  appoint 

exclusive nodal officers so that the awareness could be created and some redressal 

mechanism  could  be  evolved  in  the  company  itself.    Insurance  is  extremely 

essential and it has to be made compulsory and the premium has to be paid by the 

Government for the simple reason that most of the victims are poor and illiterate.   

India has the lowest allocation in the world for health as a percentage of GDP.  We 

should  give  more  priority  to  education  and  health.    Penal  action  should  be  taken 

against  the  doctors  who  deny  treatment  and  also  against  those  people  who  are 

responsible for stocking the drugs but do not do so.
