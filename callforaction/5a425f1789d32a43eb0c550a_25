    GST  is  a  big  change  itself  in 

indirect tax.  2% growth in Indian economy is expected with proposed GST Bill.  

A  decision  to  constitute  GST  council  in  the  leadership  of  respected  Finance 

Minister has been taken to give final shape to GST structure.  A GST network 

has  been  set  up  with  consent  of  all  the  States,  it  would  be  an  independent 

company. GST council has prepared five tax slabs for GST.  A large change in 

indirect taxes has been brought, considering consumer as the central point.  The 

prices of daily need items are likely to be reduced.  In proposed GST Bill, there 

is  a  provision  to  keep  land,  house  building,  immovable  property  sale,  out  of 

GST.  It is in interest of common people.  Whether farmer will be brought for 

agriculture land leasing in the ambit of GST or agricultural land leasing will be 

kept  free  form  GST  tax?    A  good  amount  of  tax  collection  from  trade  in  sea 

upto 12 sea miles go to the State Governments in Maharashtra and other States.  

There  is  possibility  of  going  this  in  favour  of  integrated  GST  under  the  said 

GST bill.  It is a matter of concern for all the States.  All such States have made 

a  demand  to  consider  this  tax  collection  as  the  State  revenue.    Whether  the 

Hon'ble  Minister  of  Finance  will  recommend  to  add  the  said  revenue  in  State 

compensation amount, it will provide assistance to the State Governments?
