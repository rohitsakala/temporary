 Five crore people of Andhra 

Pradesh  are  suffering  a  lot  due  to  the  unscientific  bifurcation  done  by  the  earlier 

UPA Government.  I thank the former  HRD Minister and Prime Minister as they 

have given permission to start 9 institutions out of 11.  It is a historical step after 

independence of this country.  I request him to extend all the support.  We all know 

very  well  as  to  how  much  money  is  required  to  build  a  National  Institute  of 

Technology  and  Javedkarji  is  providing  Rs.40  crore  for  this  institute.    I  would 

request  the  hon.  HRD  Minister  to  create  the  entire  infrastructure  for  the  National 

Institute of Technology, Tadepalligudam before the completion of the first batch.  I 

would  also  like  to  request  the  Government  of  India  to  provide  more  and  more 

funds  to  higher  education  in  our  country  because  providing  education  is  the 

responsibility of the Government.  The IITs and NITs are not only suffereing from 

the  shortage  of  teachers  but  also  from  the  shortage  of  fund.    Besides,  the  most 

important  thing  is  research  where  we  have  cut  a  sorry  figure  for  a  number  of 

reasons.    For  that,  we  would  have  to  create  a  world-class  environment  in  our 

education institutions.  Besides, we should maintain the holistic atmosphere in our 

educational institutions.  Then only, we would be able to provide quality education 

to the students.  The industrialization is not increasing in proportion to the increase 

in the engineering graduates.  So, I would request that we should concentrate more 

in  bringing  industrialization  on  par  with  education.    Only  then  we  would  be  in 

position  to  provide  more  and  more  jobs  to  our  engineering  graduates  and  other 

graduates.  At the same time, I would also request the hon. Minister to increase the 

budgetary allocation in this regard.
