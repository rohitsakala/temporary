  The  historic  agreement  that  was 

signed last year December for exchange of enclaves, has been supported by us all.  

Now  we  are  discussing  the  Election  Laws  (Amendment)  Bill,  2016.    The  people 

who have come should have the Right to Vote before the forthcoming election in 

West  Bengal  after  this  Bill  is  passed  in  this  House  today,  unanimously.    If  the 

Government wants and empowers the District Magistrates, this can be easily done.  

When voting rights are being conferred, civil rights should also be offered.  In my 

own constituency, there was a place called Charmeghna where people were Indian 

but the land was in Bangladesh.  I had visited the place.  There were no facilities, 

no  roads,  no  water,  no  good  schools,  nothing.    They  were  just  surviving  without

basis  amenities  of  life.    The  Government  has  to  look  after  these  people.    Both 

Central  and  the  State  Governments  have  to  fulfil  their  responsibilities.    The 

enclaves are all situated in the border areas.  The law and order situation become 

very  grim  after  evening.    Indian  police  is  not  allowed  to  enter,  army  is  nowhere.  

The  crops  are  looted  every  now  and  then.    The  Central  Government  must  ensure 

that the BSF steps up vigil in that area.  No one is found there people to save them.  

They  are  Indians,  our  brothers.    Only  voting  rights  will  not  suffice.    They  need 

proper  education,  safety.    They  are  lagging  behind  in  all  aspects.    They  have  no 

stable source of income.  It is difficult to transfer animals and to visit a bereaved 

family  if  someone  dies  on  the  other  side.    I  request  the  Central  and  State 

Governments to discharge their duties properly.
