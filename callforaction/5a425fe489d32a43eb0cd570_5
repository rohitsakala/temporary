    Odisha  is  an  underdeveloped  State 

where almost 40 per cent of our total population belongs to the Scheduled Castes 

and Scheduled Tribes.  It is a matter of pride for our State two categories namely, 

Bariki and Kummari have been opted out of the SC category.  Timely exclusion of 

categories  is,  therefore,  necessary  to  accommodate  the  needs  of  the  really 

backward communities.  Government of Odisha has recommended so  many times 

for  inclusion  of  some  communities  like  Kalar,  Durva,  Duruwa  etc.  as  Scheduled 

Castes.  There are about 147 sects of tribes which are to be included.  I am sorry to 

say  that  it is not  being  heard properly  by  the  Government of  India.   I  would also 

request the Government that the reservation of SC and ST should also be there for 

jobs  in  the  corporate  sector.    I  would  like  to  draw  your  attention  with  regard  to 

misuse  the  power  and  position  by  the  officers  belonging  to  the  Scheduled  Caste 

community.    The  most  important  concern  here  is  that  there  are  instances  where 

even senior Government officials have been misusing their positions and powers.  I 

have  all  sympathy  to  the  under-privileged,  down-trodden  and  marginalised 

communities  like  SCs  and  STs  but  not  at  the  cost  of  the  most  needy  within  the 

community.
