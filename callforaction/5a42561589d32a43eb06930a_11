 The Government proposes to amend 

the  Article  20  and  20A  keeping  the  present  circumstances  in  view.    The  Law 

Commission has also recommended for amendment of the same. I am also of the 

view that trustee of any trust should have liberty to invest its funds.  Through this 

amendment,  now  the  private  trusts  alongwith  the  Government  fund,  Employee's 

Provident Fund Organization would also get benefitted because they will have now 

more  liberty  and  rights  to  invest  in  shares  which  might  give  more  returns.    The 

foreign  institutions  are  investing  their  funds  in  the  Indian  security  market  and 

getting more returns.  Therefore, the private and government trusts of the country 

should  have  also  the  same  right.    We  frequently  come  across  news  items  about 

scams  in  such  investment.   Therefore,  there  should  be  an  effective  mechanism  in 

place  for  its  monitoring  to  ensure  that  no  one  in  authority  exercises  his  powers 

arbitrarily.
