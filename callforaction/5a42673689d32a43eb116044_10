  The  Bill  Indian  Standards  Bureau  Bill,  2015  seeks  to 

replace  the  Indian  Standards  Bureau  Act, 1986.   India is  a  country  of  consumers.  

Our Prime Minister has ushered in a new chapter by announcement Make in India 

for  exporting  the  Indian  products  in  the  international  market.    Therefore,  it 

becomes  all  the  more  important  that  we  possess  those  standards  which  could 

establish the identity of Indian products in the international markets.  It is not only 

in terms of the exports but also keeping in mind the fact that India has a population 

of 125 crore with the products and services reaching upto the last hamlets of every 

village that we require the services and articles of top most quality.  I would like to 

request the hon. Minister that  when  we  talk  about  hallmarking  only  321  agencies 

are  there  that  are  going  to  take  care  of  standardization.    I  would  like  to  know 

whether  the  Government  had  allowed  self-certification  in  hallmarking  also.    I 

would like to request that if the government propose to allow self-certification then 

it  is  desirable  that  our  laboratories  are  also  of  the  international  standards.    The 

penal provisions under the Bill are very lax.  The law should be stringent enough 

not  to  allow  anybody  to  misuse  the  ISI  mark  and  manufacture  the  sub-standard 

articles  so  that  ISI  mark  could  find  a  distinct  identity  for  the  Indian  products  in 

international market.  By only doing this we will be able to give a new direction to 

the consumers of the country.
