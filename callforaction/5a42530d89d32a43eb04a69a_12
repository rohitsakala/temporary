  I  would  like  to  state  that  animal  husbandry  is 

also  related  to  agriculture  but  income  tax  for  income  derived  from  animal 

husbandry is set aside. This income also should be declared as agriculture income 

and  a  person  seeking  loan  to  purchase  livestock  should  be  charged  4  per  cent 

interest.   I also suggest to promote organic farming in each and every village. The 

cow milk has many advantages. Cow dung is an organic manure. One cow shelter 

should be set up in every village so that bovine species are protected. Farmers can 

feel relief by giving their bovine property under the care of cow shelter authority. 

Cow dung is very useful to farmers and pave the path for organic farming. During 

2017-18 construction of 5 lakh agro ponds will be initialed. The slogan of 'har keth 

ko pani' seems to come true. The areas which had been inaccessible to water will 

get  water  through  one  drop  more  crop  scheme  and  5  thousand  crore  is  allocated 

therefor. Farmers are helpless lot. Sometimes they suffer due to drought or excess 

rain fall. Some days ago cumin and isabgol were flourishing standing crops in my 

area.  Due  to  rains  farmers  suffered.  The  Pradhan  Mantri  Bima  Fasal  Yojana  is  a 

welcome step that provides insurance for losses of their crops.
