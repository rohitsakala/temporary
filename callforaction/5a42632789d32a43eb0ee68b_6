  While  implementing  public  private  partnership, 

the Government has to think very seriously about it.  It may create hurdle for the poor 

people.   Brain drain occurs  due to  lack  of  opportunities  and less remuneration.   So, 

not only employment opportunities will have to be created but more salary also.  The 

Bill  with  a  very  good  intention  gives  more  and  more  opportunities  to  the  students 

who want to go for engineering and particularly, information technology.
