    There  are  many  villages  and  slum 

areas in my Parliamentary constituency.  These areas do not have Pucca houses and 

they lack basic facilities.  I, therefore, seek more funds for the State Government of 

Jharkhand for the purpose of urban development so that all the poor people can have 

their  own  houses.    The  government  has  been  providing  loans  to  the  urban  poor, 

economically  backward  sections  and  the  low  income  groups  through  the  primary 

institutions  for  the  purpose  of  housing.    These  loans  are  easily  available  and 

subsidies  are  being  given  on  them  but  it  is  being  seen  that  this  scheme  has  been 

restricted to a few States. This scheme is not being implemented in Jharkhand.  The 

loan  component  under  this  scheme  should  be  enhanced  because  more  funds  are 

needed for the construction of houses.
