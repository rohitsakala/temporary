  Several  Hon.  Members  have  given 

their pertinent suggestions regarding this bill.  I would like to speak on the issue of 

empowering the Panchayati Raj institutions.  Lakhs of cases are pending in various 

courts.    If  trivial  or  small  cases  could  be  dealt  at  the  level  of  Panchayats,  the 

burden  on  higher  judiciary  will  decrease.    Lok  Adalats  have  tried  to  dispense 

speedy  and  economical  justice,  but  the  rot  in  the  system  has  not  yet  been  fully 

stemmed.   So, timely  and speedy  dispensation of  justice  if needed.   The  criminal 

cases  bring  out  the  worst  flaws  in  our  judicial  system.    People  are  wrongly 

convicted  at  times  in  cases  of  Cr  Pc  302.    So,  justice  becomes,  a  casualty  at  the 

alter of clout and influence wielded by the rich and the powerful.  The Government

must  come  to  the  aid  of  the  poor  people.    There  should  be  transparency  in  the 

banking transactions.  Farmers generally take agricultural loans.  If their standing 

crops are destroyed due to natural calamities, the farmers fail to return their loans 

in  time.    So,  the  Government  must  bail  out  such  hapless  people.    The  small 

families will gain out of this bill.
