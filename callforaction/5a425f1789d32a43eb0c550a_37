  The  GST  will  consolidate  all 

the State economies. It will make a significant breakthrough paving the way for 

an  all-inclusive  indirect  tax  reforms  in  the  country.  When  all  the  taxes  are 

integrated,  it  would  make  possible  the  taxation  burden  to  be  split  equitably 

between the manufacturing sector and services sector. It will also help to build a 

transparent and corruption free tax administration.  By  implementing  the  GST,  

India  is  said  to  be  gaining  around  15  billion  USD  in  a  year  which  will  be 

profitable  for  the  country  and  this  can  be  spent  on  many  welfare  activities.  It 

will  also provide  for more  exports, create more  employment  opportunities  and 

boost the growth.  Regarding  the  industry  28  per  cent  slab  is  a  major  concern. 

So time should be given to the industry to come up with their own schemes and 

programmes.  Basically,  education  and  health  should  be  put  under  zero  slab 

because  they  are  more  connected  with  the  common  person.  Further,  people 

should be given enough opportunity to represent before the Council when they 

want some discretion in the tax.
