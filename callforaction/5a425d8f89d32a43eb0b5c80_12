  With  the  provisions  of  the  Bill  coming  into 

effect, the smaller banks would get  merged and become a single bank and would 

definitely  get  the  credibility  which  is  required.    The  banks  which  are  getting 

merged and the mother bank to which these smaller banks are getting merged, all 

are suffering from one disorder and that is NPA.  Instead of treating the symptoms 

I would like to urge upon the Ministry of Finance to identify the disease itself.  The 

infrastructure sector, the steel industry and the power industry are mainly causing 

NPA to banks.  Directly or indirectly, for the NPAs being caused in these sectors, 

China is  responsible.   We  have the  anti-dumping  mechanism  in  place.   There  are 

other  mechanisms  also  in  place,  like  there  are  tariff  barriers,  there  are  non-tariff 

barriers.    That  should  have  been  invoked  long  back  so  that  the  NPAs  would  not 

have been caused to the level that we are faced with now.  The provisions of the 

Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code will help solve the problem of the NPAs in this 

country.  The State Bank of India is adopting those banks which are already sick 

with NPAs.  The health of the family needs to be improved by taking care of the 

disease per se and not just redressing the symptoms.  Let us diagnose that instead 

of always blaming China as a villain.  Let us also reform our own internal issues 

like  loan  waivers  and  others  to  address  the  issue  of  NPA  in  the  interest  of  the 

nation.
