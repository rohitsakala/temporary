  The  hon.  Minister  has  presented  a  very 

important  Bill  in  the  House.    The  Government  needs  to  ponder  over  as  to  what 

steps it can take for the children deprived of education.  The standard of education 

has  to  be  same  throughout  the  country.    Under  the  provisions  of  the  Bill,  the 

Government  will have  to  monitor  whether  the  training  of  teachers is taking  place 

properly or not.  It has to mobilize data to find whether the training of teachers in 

private schools is also going on properly or not.  I strongly demand and would like 

to know  why  should we  deprive  a child of  right  to quality  education?    It is not  a 

question of  right  to education  alone, it is a  question of right to  quality  education.  

Are  we  going  to  impart  quality  education  to  him  which  is  not  being  imparted  to 

him.  While welcoming the Bill I would like to say that the Government will have 

to  create  proper  educational  facilities.    Therefore,  I  would  like  to  request  that 

whenever we talk in terms of providing equality of opportunities in education then 

such  opportunities  will  have  to  be  created  for  preparing  a  conducive  atmosphere 

for  providing  quality  education.    The  Government  has  made  an  allocation  of 

Rs.453 crore in this regard.  This amount should percolate down to the lowest level 

but  it  is not  happening.   The  Government  needs to  ponder  over  that  the  deprived 

are not getting the facilities of good quality.  I once again demand that let us go for 

a  CBSE  standard  throughout  the  country,  particularly  for  primary  and  secondary 

education.    Once  you  go  for  that  the  standard  will  be  the  same  throughout  the 

country.  The standard of subjects like science, maths etc. should be equivalent to 

global education.
