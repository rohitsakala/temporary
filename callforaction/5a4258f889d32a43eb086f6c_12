  I  support  the  Bill,  because  there  is  a 

need to seriously discuss the issues concerning petroleum and renewable energy.  I 

would  like  to  say  that  the  petroleum  companies  would  benefit  from  the  research 

and  development  work  of  the  proposed  institute.    So,  we  should  make  these 

petroleum  companies  partner  and  take  contribution  from  them.   We  have  to have 

some  kind  of  bond  so  that  the  students  graduating  from  this  Institute  should 

undertake  research  work  for  at  least  five  years.    I  would  like  to  make  one  more 

request,  because  this  institute  is  likely  to  largely  focus  on  KG  basin.    There  are 

other areas like refineries in Panipat and Bhatinda.  We should set up institutes in 

these areas also.
