 

I  appreciate 

the  Government 

for 

introducing the IIM Bill, 2017, which will address a long pending demand of the 

academia to give degree-granting power to the IIMs and also give them academic 

freedom in pursuit of excellence.  I am happy to note that the new Bill will address 

most of the autonomy-related concerns of IIM fraternity and it will make each of 

the 20 IIMs an institute of national importance.  It is good to note that the institutes 

will  be  managed  by  an  independent  Board  and  each  will  have  a  Chairperson  and 

Director, which will be selected by the Board instead of the Government.   I think 

the new Bill should incorporate some provisions where IIIMs will be engaged as a 

management think tank for the local governments.  IIMs can also be used as hubs 

to train, plan, monitor and help management of social service initiatives.  The IIM 

Extension Centres will make IIM's knowledge resources accessible to sustain and 

enhance the quality of human life for the local communities.
