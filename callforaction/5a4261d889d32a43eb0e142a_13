    I  am  grateful  to  the  hon.  Minister  of 

Health for bringing in such a good Bill.  The youths, the old, the women and the 

school  children  are  also  getting  affected  with  the  mental  disorders  but  there  are 

neither hospitals nor doctors and nurses in adequate number as per requirement for 

their  treatment.    I  hail  from  Assam  where  there  is  only  one  hospital  at  Tejpur 

despite having the population of 3.5 crore.  Small hospitals are required to be set 

up  all  across  Assam  in  order  to  make  treatment  accessible  to  each  and  every 

village.  I would also like to state that providing treatment to the persons suffering 

from mental disorders should be made mandatory for private and district hospitals 

according to their capacity.  I would like to urge that the facilities for the treatment 

of mental disorders should also accessible to villages.   I would like to bring in the 

notice  that  Dhubri, Goalpara,  Barpeta  and  Nagaon  are  such  places  where  a  large 

number  of  cases  of  mental  ailments  are  being  recorded.    There  is  our  charitable 

hospital  where  some  of  the  seats  may  be  reserved  for  the  treatment  of  mental 

patients, if such is asked to do.
