 Today, the greatest problem that the country is 

facing is about the influx of people from rural areas to urban areas. People have been 

migrating from rural areas to urban areas in search of job and livelihood. Therefore, 

the first and the foremost issue that needs to be tackled is to restrict the migration of 

people  from  rural  areas  to  urban  areas.  People  are  forced  to  live  in  slums  and 

unhygienic areas due to lack of proper shelter at affordable price. The Government 

has identified 305 smart cities in the country. The need of the hour is to ensure basic 

infrastructure  facilities  in  each  and  every  city  of  the  country  and  to  provide  roads, 

housing,  electricity,  water  and  other  facilities  to  the  people  at  affordable  prices.  In 

my  constituency  Chitradurga,  I  have  been  finding  this  problem  of  migration  of 

people to Bengaluru. I would suggest that the Government should set up at least one 

major industry in each district of the country. If this is done, the migration of people 

could be stopped and people would also get employment in such industries.
