  The country is most concerned regarding research, which 

is  of  very  poor  quality.  It  is  not  as  if  students  and  teachers  are  not  good  but  the 

students passing out of IITs and NIITs either move to Civil Services or join Multi-

National  Companies.  We  spend  so  much  billion  dollars  on  arms  purchase.  The 

reason being that  we  fail to  develop technology. A  Member  referred  to  corpus  in 

Harvard  which  was  created  by  the  private  sector  there.    We  need  persons  with 

hearts like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet. Our corporate sector is concerned only with 

profit. The House should discuss as to why the private sector is not contributing in 

this regard. There is no practical orientation in our country. Here, more attention is 

paid on  pure  science.  Another  fact is  that those  seeking  admission in M.Tech  are 

not  from  B.Tech. The  students of  B.Tech  either  go  abroad or join  Civil Services. 

Our research is much lower compared to China and other countries. Full discussion 

is needed in this regard. We should stop the practice of borrowing technology from 

abroad. The professors are not given the dignity and power due to them. They do 

not get much money also.
