  I  welcome  this  Bill  with  open  arms.  

However, we have taken 25 years to take up this bill for consideration and passing.  

Even  if  there  might  be  certain  flaws  in  the  Bill,  the  government  deserves 

appreciation for bringing this Bill.  As regards, Clause 17, section 2, I would urge 

upon the Minister to make certain clarifications and also he can remedy it.  This is 

the time when flaws can be removed.  The repealing of this old British law should 

have  been  done  much  earlier,  but  I  am  glad  that  it  is  being  done  now  by  this 

Government.    At  the  same  time,  I  would  also  say  that  it  would  also  reduce  the 

burden  on  Kolkata,  Mumbai  and  Madras  High  Court.    I  think  that  claim  for  life 

should get the top most priority.  I hope the Minister understands the logic behind 

it  and  it  should  be  corrected  in  the  priority  list.    The  territorial  water  is  also 

required  to  be  demarcated  after  a  wider  consultation.    Given  the  fact  that  95  per 

cent of our trade is carried out through port, it is necessary to expand our horizon.  

In the end, we support this Bill with little amendments which you want to make.
