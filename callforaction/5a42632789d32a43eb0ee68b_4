  The  Bill  proposes  to  set  up  Indian 

Institute  of  Information  Technology  in  public-private  partnership  mode.    In  this 

model, there will be autonomy in governance that will help in addressing the present 

challenges  faced  by  the  Indian  information  technology  industry  in  our  country.    It 

will  help  in  growth  of  the  domestic  information  technology  market  including 

developing new knowledge areas and creating skilled manpower of global standards.  

It  is  extremely  necessary  that  we  create  world-class  education  centres  to  develop 

skilled  manpower  in  emerging  sectors.    Fifteen  functional  Indian  Institutes  of 

Information  Technology  in  public  private  partnership  mode  are  proposed  to  be 

declared  as  Institutes  of  national  importance.    The  Government  hopes  that  trained 

personnel from these Institutes shall fulfill the growing demand for skilled, technical 

manpower in emerging IT sectors and the economy as a whole.  Establishing IIITs in 

Public  Private  Partnership  and  subsequently  declaring  them  as  Institute  of  national 

importance  would  help  in  providing  world-class  education  to  students  to  foster 

research and development and make the way for India becoming a world-class leader.  

I  would  request  the  hon.  Minister  of  Human  Resource  Development  to  please  note 

that  the  Kalyani  IIIT,  West  Bengal  has no  permanent  building.   Also, parity  in  fee-

structure  among  the  different  IIITs  would  help  in  promoting  standardization  and 

equality.  I  would  like  to  request  the  Government  to  clarify  that  if  Government 

funding  is  only  for  five  years  what  will  happen  thereafter.    These  institutions  may 

increase the fee making it difficult for the poor students.
