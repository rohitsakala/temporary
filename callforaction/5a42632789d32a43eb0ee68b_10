  In  principle,  I  oppose  this  concept  of 

having  public  private  partnership  in  higher  education  sector.    I  fully  agree  with  the 

hon.  Minister  that  it  is  a  necessity  and  urgency.    We  have  already  commenced  15 

IIITs.    To  confer  the  statutory  status  to  these  educational  institutions  is  need  of  the 

hour.    But,  the  only  point  is  that  this  IIIT  should  give  access  to  the  poor  children 

belonging to BPL and the common people of this country.  In Clause 3, sub-Clause 

(b), the 'Board' in relation to any Institute means "the Board of Governors referred to 

in  sub-Section(1)  of  Section  14."    This  is  not  a  pure  and  clear  definition  in  Clause.  

My  next  point  is  this.    This  is  a  self-financing  institute.    I  agree  with  this  50:35:15 

ratio.  But, the capital expenditure will be borne by the Government of India for five 

years.    Subsequent  to  the  said  five  years,  who  will  finance  these  institutes?  

Definitely, it will be a self-financing institute.  What is the fate of the Self-financing 

institute?    I  can  share  my  experience  in  my  State.    We  have  started  self-financing 

colleges  and  engineering  colleges  are  started  like  anything.    Now,  the  hon.  High 

Court has come to a verdict that most of the colleges have a result of less than 10 per 

cent and the entire higher education scenario is in peril.  Resources have to be found 

within the organization.  That means the fees will be very high and the poor children 

or the poor students will not be able to afford the fee structure.
