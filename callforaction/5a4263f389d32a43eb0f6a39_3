 The road transport plays pivotal role in 

the  Indian  economy.    The  license  fees  and  penalties  which  have  been  increased 

heavily  need  to  be  reduced.    The  amount  of  the  installment  of  the  third  party 

insurance is also required to be brought down.  Lakhs of cases are lying pending in 

various courts on account of the vague definition of the third party insurance and 

the  sufferers  in  these  cases  are  none  other  than  coolies,  cleaners,  extra  drivers 

passengers etc. and hence a provision is also required to be made for them.  In case 

of  the  non-renewal  of  licenses  of  the  driver,  he  does  not  get  the  benefit  of 

insurance if an accident takes place.  In this respect, the provisions are required to 

be relaxed.  The provisions vesting the power of registration of new vehicles in the 

dealers might be misused.  Registration is a constitutional and judicial power and 

hence  it  requires  to  be  vested  in  the  government  itself.    The  agreement  among 

states in the inter-state transport such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, Maharashtra 

and Andhra Pradesh needs not to be tinkered with as it will render 3 lakh transport 

employees jobless.
