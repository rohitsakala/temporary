 It is a very perfect Bill. It is a customer 

friendly legislation.  Further transparency and accountability are being brought in.  

As far as the fraudulent developers and promoters are concerned, they can be well 

controlled in this Bill. I support this Bill.  When the construction takes place, there 

is rampant and continued destruction of land, trees and plants.  A considerable area 

should be earmarked for green plantation.  A very little is being given in the name 

of  emergency  provision.    So,  I  would  submit  that  a  considerable  space  may  be 

allotted  for  emergency  services.    My  last  point  is  about  the  preservation  and 

protection of cultivable lands.  It should be taken care of  by the hon. Minister.
