    Today,  the  Minister  has  brought  this  Bill  to 

resolve  the  issue  of  transportation.    We  have  rainfed  rivers.    When  we  need  a 

minimum water level up to two metres, the fainfed rivers may not have that level 

continuously for 12 months.  So, what exactly are we going to do?  The work on 

National  Waterways  No.  4  and  5  have  slowed  down  for  requirement  of  financial 

support.  I request the hon. Minister to have a special body to coordinate with all 

the  different  Departments  so  that  the  issues  are  resolved  immediately  for  getting 

projects cleared.  States have their own problems.  I request the hon. Minister that 

in  this  respect  let  us  have  a  committee  at  the  State  level.    Why  can  we  not  have 

regional offices at the State-level also which will coordinate with the Headquarters 

and  the  problem  can  be  solved?    I  would  like  to  request  you  that  Vasai  Creek  to 

Kalyan, Mumbai  to Dharamtar, Rajpuri means  Murud or  Dighi to  Mumbai  Vasai 

be incorporated in the waterways project.
