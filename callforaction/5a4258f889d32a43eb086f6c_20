  The  condition  of  research  in  India  is  very 

pitiable.    Indian  Institute  of  Petroleum  and  Energy  Bill  will  prove  to  be  a 

milestone.  It is my request that such an institute be set up in northern India also.  

Much research is needed in the field of solar energy, wind energy and alternative 

energy.    Barauni  refinery  the  only  major  refinery  was  set  up  70  years  ago.    My 

suggestion is that through the CSR initiative the institute can be developed.  There 

are  immense  reserves  in  Purnia,  Baisee  and  between  Bengal  and  Assam  which 

needs  to  be  explored.  There  is  no  shortage  of  reserves  in  India.    What  lacks  is 

research.  I congratulate you for setting up such an institute.
