  Providing  constitutional  status  to  the 

National Commission for Backward Classes is the need of the hour.  Every State is 

having a Commission for the Backward Classes.  Now who is a backward class is 

being determined by the State.   So, I would like to urge upon the Government that 

the consent of the State should be taken in order to determine a particular society 

or  a  particular  class  as  backward  class.    There  are  also  economically  backward 

people among the forward castes.  But only because of the reason that they belong 

to the forward castes, they are being denied of all the privileges.  The people who 

are economically backward but belong to forward classes of the society should also 

be  provided  with  some  privileges  so  as  to  have  the  better  living  standard  in  our 

country.  The Socio-Economic and Caste Census should be published.
