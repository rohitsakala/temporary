  I would like to say a few words about 

the Bill and its importance.  Here we are coming in front of the august House for 

an  amendment  in  the  First  Schedule  of  the  Industries  (Development  and 

Regulation)  Act,  1951  so  that  we  are  able  to  transfer  the  authority  to  regulate 

potable alcohol to States as was recommended by the Law Commission in its 158th 

Report.    A  constitution  bench  of  the  hon.  Supreme  Court,  in  the  case  of  M/s. 

Synthetic & Chemicals held that the power to issue licences to manufacture, both 

potable and non-potable alcohol, vested with the Central Government.  That was in 

1991.    Then,  subsequently  a  division  bench  of  the  Supreme  Court  revised  that 

judgement in the Bihar Distilleries Vs. Union of  India case, for which the verdict 

was  pronounced  on  29th  January,  1997.    In  that,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that 

manufacturing alcohol, for potable purposes, shall be under the total and exclusive 

control of the States in all respects, including the establishment of the distillery and 

levy of Central Excise Duty and so on.   So, the amendment, actually, should have, 

immediately,  been  done.    But  there  was  a  lot  of  engagement  with  the  Law 

Commission  and  we  have  taken  the  Law  Commission's  recommendations  on 

board.    As  a  result  of  that,  we  have  now  come  before  this  House  with  the 

amendment  that  the  26th  heading  of  the    First  Schedule  under  the  Industries 

(Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 be read as 'fermentation industries other 

than potable alcohol' be considered and passed by this House.
