  Further  the  Supreme  Court  also  said 

that  the  experience  and  knowledge  gained  by  a  successful  lawyer  at  the  Bar  can 

never  be  considered  to  be  less  important  from  any  point  of  view  vis-a-vis  the 

experience  gained  by  a  judicial officer.   Such  a  discrepancy  does  not  exist  in  the 

law governing salaries and service conditions of Supreme Court Judges.  I would 

like to inform the hon. Minister also that of late, the Bills which are circulated to 

the Members contain many errors and omissions.  Hence, I would request the hon. 

Law Minister to circulate Bills without errors and also print the complete Bill with 

complete  bare  Act.    Again,  the  Government  must  consider  the  long  pending 

demand  of  the  Madras  Bar  and  the  people  of  southern  India  for  establishing  a 

bench of Supreme Court in Chennai to cater to the legal needs of the people living 

in the Southern States of India.  Now a days, High Courts and the Supreme Court 

are flooded with Public Interest Litigations.  Many of these are frivolous petitions.    

The Government must address this problem with a suitable legislation.  I urge upon 

the Government to bring about a new and credible National Judicial Appointment 

Commission  Bill  with  a  provision  to  set  up  a  State-level    Judicial  Appointment 

Commission  for  the  appointment  of  High  Court  judges.  Our  Party  welcomes  the 

amendments made by this Bill.
