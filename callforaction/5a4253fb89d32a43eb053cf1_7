 Whenever we talk about Bangladesh, we always 

get  reminded  of  Bengal  Partition, 1906  and  annulment  of  Bengal  Partition, 1911.  

From this, the greatest lesson the British learnt was that they could not divide the 

Bengal  people.    Then  they  shifted  their  capital  to  Delhi  and  afterwards,  Pakistan 

was created from India.  When we look at the map, it is very surprising to see how 

Bangladesh can be a part of Pakistan, which is situated on the other side of India 

and  ultimately,  Bangladesh  was  created  in  1971.    I  request  the  hon.  Minister  to 

look into the issues between Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu and to facilitate free trade 

so as to  benefit the  people of both sides.  We, on  behalf of  Telugu  Desam  Party, 

fully support this Bill.
