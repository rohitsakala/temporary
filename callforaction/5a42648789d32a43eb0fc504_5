  The  objective  of  the  Bill is 

laudable.  It aims at disseminating knowledge by providing teaching and research 

facilities in bio-technology and related fields.  It also aims at facilitating transfer of 

technology  and  knowledge  in  the  SAARC  region  and  Asia.    The  Board  of 

Governors  do  not  have  in  its  Board  a  public  representative.    Perhaps,  the  Hon. 

Minister  may  think  of  considering  this  suggestion  of  including  a  public 

representative in the Board of Governors. Regarding review of the functioning of 

the centre, review should be held every two years instead of four years by persons 

appointed  by  the  Central  Government.    While  setting  up  of  a  centre  in  Southern 

India  in  near  future, the  Government  may  consider  setting  up  of  such  a  centre  in 

the  State  of  Andhra  Pradesh  because  of  the  rich  bio-diversity  of  the  State  and 

because  of  the  scope  of  scientific  development  in  the  place,  particularly  at 

Visakhapatnam.    Many  Indian  scientists  are  going  abroad  because  of  so  many 

reasons.   In  the  universities  now  we  are  witnessing  a  lot of  political  interference.  

So,  the  universities  should  work  independently  without  any  political  interference 

and  it  is  then  only  that  we  can  stop  this  brain  drain.    The  other  point  is  that  we 

should also increase the Budget for research and development, not only in the field 

of  biotechnology  but  in  other  spheres  of  research  also.    Lastly,  I  appreciate  the 

Government and the Minister for giving legality to this institution.  India has all the 

ingredients to become a global leader in affordable healthcare.
