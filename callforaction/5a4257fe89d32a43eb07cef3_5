 Will these courts have a parallel jurisdiction with 

the Tribunals or those courts which are already established or are they going to be 

combined  and  made  as  one  or  what  is  the  road  map  for  the  establishment  of 

commercial  courts?    As  far  as  the  issue  of  appointment  of  judges,  there  is  acute 

deficiency of the judicial officers.  I have a small suggestion.  There are so many 

law  experts,  revenue  officers  who  have  retired.    There  are  so  many  financial 

consultants,  Chartered  Accountants  and  Chartered  Accountancy  Training 

Institutes.    There  are  a  lot  of  faculty  members.    Therefore,  think  of  appointing 

technical experts, having technical knowledge of the revenue matters particularly.
