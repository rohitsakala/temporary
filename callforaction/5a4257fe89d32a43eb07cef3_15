  This  Bill  has  been  brought  in  backdrop  of  the 

intention of this Government to mobilise a large amount of foreign investment for the 

country.    Some  of  the  foreign  companies  hesitate  to  run  their  business  in  India    in 

view of the litigations which go on for years.  With the passing of this legislation all 

the commercial disputes and cases involving an amount of more than one crore which 

have been pending in various High Courts and Civil Courts will be transferred to the 

concerned commercial divisions  and commercial courts.  With the setting up of such 

courts  speedy  justice  could  be  ensured  and  it  would  result  in  saving  of  billions  of 

rupees  involved  in  various  long  pending  litigations  related  to  various  projects  of 

different  sectors  of  economy.    This  money  could  be  utilized  for  increasing  the 

productivity.  This Bill will be a historic step in promoting Make in India campaign 

and enhancing the business prospects and even those entities will be able to invest in 

India who at present are fearful about making any investment into the country.  Crores 

of cases are pending in the various courts of the country.  I am pretty optimistic that 

this Bill will prove effective in reducing the burden of pendency in courts.
