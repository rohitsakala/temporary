    The  Indian  Institute  of 

Petroleum and Energy Bill, 2017 is related with the sanction for the setting up of 

Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy at Visakhapatnam of Andhra Pradesh.  I 

would  like  to  put  forth  a  few  questions  related  with  my  State.    The  Union 

Government may set up Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy in North Eastern 

States  including  Bihar  which  could  be  a  special  package  to  remove  the 

backwardness  of  Bihar.    I  demand  special  status  for  Bihar.    I  want  that  Indian 

Institute of Petroleum and Energy be set up in my Parliamentary Constituency of 

Banka.  I would like to thank the hon. Minister for sanctioning the setting up of a 

gas bottling plant in my Parliamentary Constituency of Banka Barahat in regard to 

which  work  has  already  commenced.    I  would  like  early  completion  of  this  gas 

bottling plant.
