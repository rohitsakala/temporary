 This Bill effectively addresses most of 

the issues pertaining to the customer, addresses some of the issues pertaining to the 

developer,  but  does  not  address  the  issues  pertaining  to  the  competent  authority 

who  most  of  the  times  is  the  reason  for  delay  and  escalation  in  the  cost.  

Registration  with  the  regulatory  authority  should  be  an  on-line  process  without  a 

human interface.  For a building permission to be completed there is water supply, 

electricity supply, firefighting certificate and other certificates.  So, the developer 

is the customer to the competent authority.  The competent authorities should also 

be liable if they delay the project.  There is a clause that the developer as a safety 

measure  has  to  keep  70  per  cent  of  the  project  cost  with  the  local  competent 

authority.  My suggestion is that it should be subject to the local condition.  We are 

now setting up the Real Estate Regulatory Authority and Appellate Tribunal.  Who 

is  going  to  bear  the  cost?      There  is  rule  of  projects  over  500  square  metres.  

Sometimes,  a  clever  and  skilful  developer  may  try  to  circumvent  the  real  estate 

regulatory authorities.  Kindly take care of it.  I wholeheartedly support the Bill.
