  Before  the  Government  went  to  the 

Rajya  Sabha  our  suggestion  was  incorporated  as  an  amendment  went  to  the 

amendments  and  subsequently,  a  select  Committee  was  formed.    The  Select 

Committee suggested certain suggestions and those suggestions unanimously have 

been accepted in passing.  I would only say when we are dealing with Scheduled 

areas which are demarcated by the Constitution Schedule V and Schedule VI, it is 

a sensitive area and a sensitive issue.  In that respect, let us not rush through certain 

Bills  and  certain  amendments  in  such  a  manner  because  of  the  majoritarian 

outlook.  I would think this Government that in their wisdom, they have corrected 

the  mistake  that  was  being  committed,  and  all  mineral  bearing  States,  by  these 

amendments  are  going  to  be  benefited  tremendously  especially  those  people  who 

reside in Schedule V and Schedule VI areas. I would only ask that in this District 

Mineral Foundation and how they are going to function, how that money is going 

to pass on for the area development of those mineral where the mining is going to 

take  place.   That  needs  to  be  monitored.   I  think  the  Government of  India  would 

take the State Government into confidence and ensure the welfare of the displaced 

persons and the mine workers.
