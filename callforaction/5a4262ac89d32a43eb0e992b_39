  The  development of  such  waterways  network 

will require dredging of the river system to increase the depth causing substantial 

changes  in  river  system.  Has  any  study  been  done  to  ascertain  the  environmental 

impact of such development on the eco system and aquatic life of the river? Does 

such  development  lead  to  changes  in  the  flood  plains  of  the  river  affecting  their 

productivity and agricultural capacity as also productivity of the nation.
