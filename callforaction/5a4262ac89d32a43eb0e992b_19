  If the Government is able to develop 

this potential, definitely  it  will  be  a  record  as  far  as our  country  is  concerned.   It 

will positively contribute to the GDP of our country.  Development of waterways 

involves  dredging,  barge  construction  and  operation,  terminal  construction  and 

operation, facilities for the navigation, etc.  Definitely it will result an increase not 

only in GDP but also in employment.  So it is a welcoming step on the part of the 

Government in moving such a Bill.  My only concern, which I would like to share 

with  this  House,  is  regarding  the  cooperative  federalism.    My  only  submission  is 

that  whether  the  states  have  been  taken  into  confidence  while  arriving  at  such  a 

Bill.  For declaring a waterway as a national waterways, three conditions has to be 

fulfilled.  I would like to know whether all the three conditions are being fulfilled 

in the case of newly declared 106 National Waterway in this Bill.  Definitely, there 

is  a  conflict  with  the  State  interest  and  with  the  Inland  Waterways  Authority  of 

India Act. Kindly complete the National Waterway no. 3 in a time bound manner.
