  I welcome this Bill and the TDP Party fully 

supports  the  Bill.    This  Bill  will  replace  the  Anti-Hijacking  Act,  1982.    This  is 

defining hijacking, and it awards death penalty for hijacking in certain cases.  The 

Parliamentary  Standing  Committee  suggested  various  changes  including  making 

hoax  calls  a  punishable  offence.    My  suggestion  to  the  Government  is  that  NIA 

should  be  further  strengthened  and  more  manpower  should  be  inducted  in  the 

CISF.    The  Bill  does  not  provide  compensation  for  the  affected  persons  in 

hijacking.    I  propose  that  a  compensation  package  not  be  less  than  Rs.  4  crore 

should  be  provided  to  the  nearest  relative  of  the  deceased.    I  would  request  the 

Union  Government  to  initiate  a  process  with  all  developed  and  developing 

countries  for  setting  up  an  international  organisation  on  anti-hijacking  for  safety 

and security of the passengers.
