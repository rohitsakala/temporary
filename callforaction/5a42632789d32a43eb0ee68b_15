 This Bill would take IIITs to a new level.  

I  would like to know  whether the  Government  is  going  to  make  provisions  through 

which even the students belonging to the poor section of the society would be able to 

study  in  these  industry  supported  institutes.    I  would  also  like  to  know  as  to  under 

which model the government envisage to develop the infrastructure and mobilize the 

funds if we are to set up 20 such institutes in the country even though 35 per cent of 

this stake would be shared by the Government.  I would also like to know from the 

hon. Minister whether the large industries which are going to contribute 15 per cent 

stake will be forced to go for the development of technology.
