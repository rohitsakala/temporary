 I would want this House to carefully ponder over 

the  question  as  to  what  is  merit.    I  pose  this  question  because  I  feel  that  in  our 

country there is a grave danger of passing of accumulated caste privilege as merit.  

If there are huge sections of our people who have suffered historic injustice, then 

we should be very careful not to lable them as people who lack merit.  IIT Act wad 

passed in 1961.  But 22.5 per cent reservation were extended to the IITs in 1973.  

That was done under the Prime Ministership of Shrimati Indira Gandhi.  The OBC 

reservations were not extended until as late as 2006.  In IIT, Chennai 464 faculty 

members  were  in  the  General  Category,  59  in  the  OBC  Category,  only  11  in  the 

Scheduled Caste Category in 2015.  These numbers cannot be explained by merit 

alone.    We  have,  now  given  some  accessibility  to  our  IITs  and  to  our  Central 

Universities to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  But the question is, have 

we  given  them  the  feeling  of  equal  citizenship  inside  the  portals  of  our  great 

institutions  of  higher  learning?    We  should  make  sure  that  we  have  the  human 

resources  to  staff  the  new  institutes.    Meghnad  Saha  had  suggested  that  even 

nuclear physics research should take place in our finest universities.  I would like 

to  urge  this  Government,  while  building  on  the  achievements  of  the  past,  to  also 

show a new direction of policy for the future so that the IITs which are very good 

teaching institutions also become the venues for cutting edge research.
