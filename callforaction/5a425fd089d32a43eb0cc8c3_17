 I have risen to support the Bill.  I would like to 

say few words about the real estate.  This is a good legislation which opens up the 

process.  About 32 crore people do not own any house or any land in the country.  

This Bill will certainly create job opportunities.  There should be investigation into 

the black money invested in the real estate.  I would also like to know whether any 

provision  is  being  made  for  SCs/STs  and  OBC  in  this  Bill  to  enable  them  to  get 

employment and do business.
