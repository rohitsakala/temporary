  Regarding  the  Kakinada-

Puducherry National Waterway 4, in summer, we have to draw water from River 

Krishna and Godavari projects.  The Polavaram Project across River Godvari is a 

life-line  for  the  residuary  Andhra  Pradesh.    That  is  going  to  store  200  TMC  of 

water.  The Government of India has declared the Polavaram project as a national 

project.    Unless  this  project  is  completed,  we  have  to  draw  water  from  the 

Polavaram  Project  to  maintain  the  water  level  of  this  National  Waterway  4.  

Pulichintala project has already been completed by the State Government.  But that 

project has to be completed at the earliest.  It has been estimated that it would cost 

around Rs. 30,000 crore or something like that.  The hon. Chief Minister of Andhra 

Pradesh has said that he is going to see that the project is completed by 2018.  In 

order to complete the project by 2018, we have to spend at least Rs. 10,000 crore 

per annum on it.  Once completed, this project would help the National Waterway 

4, will help irrigate lakhs of acres of land, and also produce almost 1,000 MW of 

eco-friendly power.
