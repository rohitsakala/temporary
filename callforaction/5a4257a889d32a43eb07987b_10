    You  are  saying  that  overtime  limit  is  being 

increased  but  instead  you  are  capping  the  limit.    When  will  the  terrorism  of 

capitalism  and  corporate  end.  The  people  have  elected  you  to  eliminate  such 

terrorism.  I  humbly  request  you  that  there  should  be  agriculture  based  economy 

wherein  35  to  40  percent  people  would  be  engaged  in  agriculture  and  20  percent 

people  in  agro-based  village  industry  and  20  percent  people  would  set  up  village 

industry  for  agriculture  and  remaining  20  percent  people  would  be  engaged  in 

trade  and  service  sector.  The  farmers  co-operative,  producers  co-operative  and 

consumer co-operative should give consideration to the welfare of labourers.  You 

always divert every issue towards industrialists and industry which is not correct. 

One  of  the  eminent  economists  has  said  that  the  problem  of  imbalance  could  be 

addressed  by  putting  a  check  on  export  of  ready  products,  checking  large  scale 

migration  of  labourers  by  promoting  industrialization  at  local  level,  increasing 

employment opportunities at rural level and addressing the slum problems in rural 

areas.  The industry which requires raw materials from basic industries should be 

set up in adjoining area in order to bring them under the control of concerned state 

governments.    Local  people  should  be  provided  employment  on  priority  basis  in 

these industries except the technical staff. The industries manufacturing fertilizers, 

seeds, pesticides, agriculture equipment etc. should be set up at village, block and 

district level under the co-operative societies. The local people should be provided 

employment  on  priority  basis in these  industries  also. I urge  that  proper  attention 

should  be  paid  towards  health  and  security  of  labourers.  Lastly,  I  oppose  the 

provision of overtime made for the labourers.
