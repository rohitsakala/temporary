  The condition of dalits is not good even 

after  65  years  of  Independence.    Garodi  and  Dhangar  communities  have  been 

demanding the status of SC category for the last several years but their demand has 

not been met so far.  Though village Pramukh belongs to SC community, he does 

not  enjoy  any  rights.    There  are  165  members  in  the Parliament  belonging to BC 

community,  still  we  are  not  able  to  further  their  cause;  it  is  really  regrettable.  

Ashram  schools  admit  only  100  children  whereas  500  children  apply  for 

admission.    I,  therefore,  demand  that  more  Ashram  schools  should  be  opened  at 

district  and  tehsil  level  to  accommodate  500  children  in  each  such  school.    The 

budgetary  provision  on  this  count  has  been  slashed  in  this  year's  budget  as 

compared  to  2014-15.    I,  therefore,  request  the  Government  to  allocate  sufficient 

funds for the welfare of SCs and STs.
