 I would like to appreciate the Hon. 

Agriculture for taking number of initiatives for improving the agricultural produce 

and  help  farmers.    In  last  budget  income  security  for  farmers  was  declared.    The 

hon. Minister is putting the whole mechanism to work in this direction.  This year, 

the Government has provided record fund for agriculture credit and to achieve the 

target  in  this  field  to  the  tune  of  Rs.  10  lakh  crores.    Majority  of  farmers  are 

availing loans from cooperative societies like Vikas Societies working in rural and 

remote  areas.    As  the  farmers  are  highly  in  contact  with  the  local  Vikas  Society.  

They  should be  computerised and  linked with  the local district  co-operative bank 

and necessary financial assistance for computerisation has to be provided to them.  

The  irrigation  is  the  main  back  bone  of  the  agriculture  and  farmers.    As  in  my 

constituency  the  main  income  source  of  the  families  are  from  the  agricultural 

fields.   In  my  area  works of some  irrigation projects is held  up  for  fund shortage 

from states.  I request to provide the required financial assistance to complete and 

put  to  use  this  projects.    My  constituency  is  the  largest  supplier  of  Banana  so  a 

Banana Research Centre should be established there.  Our farmers also grow cotton 

crop  at  very  large  scale.    Therefore,  a  facilitation  centre  for  cotton  has  to  be 

established in my constituency.  Our Farmers Machine Training & Testing Institute 

should be established in my Constituency in Jalgaon District.
