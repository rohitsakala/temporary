 Budgetary allocations for the Ministry 

show  a  drastically  reduced  figure  particularly  for  'North  Eastern  Areas'.  There  has 

been  a  significant  downward  revision  for  'Grants-in-aid  to  State  Governments'. 

Government should have a time-bound target in relation to reducing the  number of 

urban  poor  in  India.  The  Government  to  ensure  the  supply-demand  mismatch  for 

housing.    Because  of  poor  governance  structures  and  financial  situation,  Urban 

Local  Bodies  find  it  difficult  to  access  external  financing  for  its  projects.  The 

Government  intend  to  encourage  innovative  financing  schemes  for  Urban  Local 

Bodies. I would urge the Government to capitalize on an efficient consumer-friendly 

real  estate  sector.  It  is  extremely  important  that  the  Government  takes  urgent  note 

and devises and implements policies that lift the millions of urban poor to a life of 

opportunities.
