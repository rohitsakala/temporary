  This  Bill  clearly  express  of  the  intention  of  the 

Central  Government  with  regard  to  finding  a  solution  to  dispute  between  Union 

and States under federal system.  Earlier alcohol was under Union Government and 

some intoxic fermentation materials were under control of state governments. But 

with the passage of this Bill the State Governments will get more powers and will 

be  able  to  set  up  distillery  their  own  units  and  manufacturing  units.    The  State 

Governments  will  also  be  able  to  deal  with  taxes  related  to  it.    Some  of  our 

colleagues were talking about ban on alcohol, presence of mafia and police torture 

in some states, but this Bill has nothing to do with all this things. I am sure this Bill 

will not lead to give rise to mafia rather will put an end to mafia.  We should trust 

the  State  governments  in  this  regard.    I  will  make  an  appeal  to  all  the  state 

governments to take strong decision to eradicate this evil of alcohol addiction and 

create new sources of income in its place.
