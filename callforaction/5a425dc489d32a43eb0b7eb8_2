 I would thank the hon. Minister for bringing this 

Bill.    The  Government  has  overhauled  the  entire  procedure  and  bring  in  great 

amount of transparency therein.  The Government has made a provision to ensure 

that no assets can be transferred without auction.  The Government has also made a 

provision  that  if  the  tribals  are  impacted  adversely  then  they  will  be  given  all 

possible  help.    This  will  no  more  happen  that  their  lands  are  acquired  and  they 

have  to  leave  the  forests.    I  would  like  to  place  a  very  practically  point.    After 

floods,  the  land  of  farmer  is  filled  with  sand  and  the  land  does  not  remain 

cultivable  nor  can  the  farmer  clean  his  land  by  removing  that  sand.    The 

Government  should  made  a  provision  that  the  farmer  should  have  right  on  that 

sand filled land for 1-3 years till the land becomes cultivable again.  As of now if 

the farmer takes out even a pan of sand  from his field then the process of mining 

sets in.  The local officers also start exploiting him.  The Government should think 

over this issue.
