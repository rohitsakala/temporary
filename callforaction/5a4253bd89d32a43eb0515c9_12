  The  Government  has  introduced  a 

stringent  anti-hijacking  law  on  the  lines  of  Beijing  Protocol  of  the  International 

Civil Aviation Organization.  This is a welcome move.  This Bill has provided for 

not  only  stringent  penal  provisions  for  the  culprits  but  also  has  provided  for  the 

confiscation of their properties.  But in majority of the cases, the hijackers or the 

conspirators do not belong to the same country to which the aircraft belongs to.  In 

such a situation how will we be able to confiscate the properties of the citizens of 

other countries.  Provisions should be incorporated in the Bill for this purpose also.
