    The  first  Prime  Minister  of  India,  late  Pandit 

Jawaharlal Nehru, with his vision, had brought up all these institutes.  You have to 

admit  that  this  was  the  vision  of  our  great  visionary  leader,  late  Rajiv  Gandhi  Ji, 

who took us to the new heights in the field of information technology and research. 

The  NIT,  Andhra  Pradesh,  was  established  and  covered  under  the  National 

Institutes of Technology, Science Education and Research Act, 2007, to declare it 

as  an  institution  of  national  importance,  which  will  ultimately  help  in  addressing 

the  aspirations  of  the  people,  and  also  of  the  poor  students,  who  are  particularly 

from Andhra Pradesh. I would demand that subjects like Environment engineering, 

Climate  Change,  which  is  very  important  now,  Eco-System  Studies,  Agricultural 

Engineering,  Avionics,  and  there  are  various  other  subjects  which  we  have  to 

ponder over and include them in the courses. I would request the Hon. Minister to 

incorporate these subjects not only in Andhra, but in all the other NITs. We have to 

concentrate  on  quality  education  so  that  brain  drain  is  stopped.  We  need  more 

educational institutions like that in Arunachal Pradesh.
