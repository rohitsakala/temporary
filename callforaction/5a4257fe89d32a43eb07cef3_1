 Though this Bill is very good, I would like to say a 

few things which should be considered as suggestions not as criticism.  There are 

about 1017 sanctioned posts of judges in courts are lying vacant.  Similarly, there 

are about 2 crore 6 lakh cases pending in courts out of which 67 per cent cases are 

of  criminal  nature.    In  such  a  scenario  how  one  can  imagine  the  expeditious 

disposal  of  cases  in  commercial  courts.    The  Government  should  think  over  this 

and expedite the process of appointing judges.  We should form an Indian Judicial 

Service  for  the  appointment  of  judges  in  the  same  way  as  the  UPSC  appoints 

candidates for IAS and IPS.  Today there is an urgent need for improvement in our 

judicial delivery system so that people could get speedy justice.  The Government 

should also consider about those 67 per cent cases of criminal nature in which the 

fundamental  rights  of  people  as  given  in  our  Constitution  often  get  violated.  

Therefore, we also need to improve our criminal justice system.
