 We are happy that the Government is setting up the 

Indian  Institute  of  Petroleum  with  an  investment  of  Rs.655  crore  as  capital  and 

Rs.250 crore as endowment, and declaring this institution as an institute of national 

importance.    We  are  requesting  him  that  there  are  many  pending  issues  in  the 

Telangana  State  also.    It  is  already  mentioned  in  the  Reorganization  Bill  that  the 

Indian  Institute  of  management  (IIM)  would  be  there  and  we  have  allocated  land 

for it, but three years have passed and there is no initiation from the Government 

side  or  the  particular  Department.    Another  issue  is  the  Horticulture  University 

promised under the State Reorganization Act 2014, which is still pending as well 

as  the  Tribal  University.    Hence,  I  would  like  to  request  the  Ministry  to  take 

initiation for the establishment of a Tribal University in Telangana.
