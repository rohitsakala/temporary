  The  background  of  this  Bill  is  the 

Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, which was earlier 

signed in Hague and recently in Beijing.  I would like to speak about clause 11 that 

extradition  in  every  case  creates  a  risk  of  inadequate  trial  of  the  accused  as 

happened in Kandhar hijack in December, 1999.  It is only because of inadequate 

trial the people involved in Kandhar hijack were again responsible for 9/11 Attack 

in  America  as  well  as  attack  in  Mumbai.    This  issue  is  required  to  be  treated  as 

political issue also otherwise this will have serious national as well as international 

ramifications.    At the same time, the issue of compensation needs to addressed to.   

So, unless  and  until we  make  the  compensation  clause  very  clear, there  will be  a 

fair  amount  of  loss  to  the  people.    With  these  few  suggestions,  I  would  like  to 

support the Bill.
