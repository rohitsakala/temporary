 The land of Delhi has been grabbed in the name 

of DDA and even the single inch of land has not been spared for the development of 

villages and consequently those villages remained undeveloped.  I would like to urge 

the Minister that a scheme should be formulated for the development of Delhi.  The 

government  should  make  such  arrangements  that  may  facilitate  the    removal  and 

resettlement of the slums at the same time.  I would like to request that the  section 

81  and  133,  which  had  been  the  root  cause  of  corruption  during  the  earlier 

government, should be abolished.
