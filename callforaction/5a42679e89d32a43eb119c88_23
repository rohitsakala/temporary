  I  rise  to  support  this  NABARD  Bill 

with certain reservations and certain concerns. The very purpose of NABARD is to 

boost  the  rural  economy  by  providing  financial  assistance  by  way  of  providing 

loans  to  three  sectors,  namely  agriculture,  rural  infrastructure,  and  small-scale 

industries.  The  contribution  of  agriculture  to  GDP  has  come  down  from  35%  in 

1981  to  14%  in  2017.  The  only  condition  under  WTO  Agreement  is  that  the 

subsidy should be to an extent to ten percent. But, in the country like India, where 

60  per  cent  of  the  population  is  still  dependent  on  agriculture,  unfortunately  that 

the  component  of  subsidy  is  being  taken  away.  So,  it  has  to  be  reviewed  and 

reconsidered  if  the  country  has  to  have  progress.  So,  if  you  want  to  double  the 

income to the farmers by 2022, then you have to not only double the lending, but 

also to increase or enhance the capacity of lending of NABARD many folds so that 

agricultural  credit  could  be  provided  to  the  farmers.  That  should  be  based  on 

subsidy,  incentives  and  other  benefits.  The  second  point  is  regarding  the  rural 

infrastructure.  My  submission  to  the  Government  is  that,  at  least, the  Member  of 

Parliament should be informed regarding that rural developmental activities which 

are being managed, funded or financed by the NABARD. My suggestion regarding 

to  increase  the  authorised  capital  of  the  bank  under  the  Bill  is  that  not  only  the 

consultation  but  also  the  consent  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  is  required.  My 

apprehension and concern is that this agricultural development bank is going to be 

an  industrial  development  bank. So, kindly  confine  the  activities  of  NABARD  to 

agriculture, rural development and small scale industries with Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 2 

crore and not with Rs. 10 crore.
