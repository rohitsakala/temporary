 The resources of public institutions are 

limited in the field of higher education.  Under such circumstances, the participation 

of  private  entities  is  absolutely  essential  so  that  good  quality  education  could  be 

imparted  as  per  the  requirement  of  the  modern  needs.    The  Bhagalpur  Engineering 

College  is  going  to  start  the  registration  of  the  batch  for  the  year  2017-18  under 

which only two subjects are going to be offered.  The registration of only 60 students 

has  been  made.    I  would  like  to  request  that  sanction  may  be  accorded  for  the 

registration of three hundred students as has been proposed by the State Government 

and the study of four subjects should be started in the college.
