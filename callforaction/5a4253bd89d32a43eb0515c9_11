 We all are linked to one another economically, 

geographically,  socially  and  culturally  not  only  in  our  country  but  also  in  the 

world.  Therefore, issues like terrorism should also be tackled from social, cultural, 

economic  and  political  point  of  view.    The  entire  world  is  against  the  capital 

punishment and at the same time it is not the solution to any problem.  Hence, this 

provision  should be abolished from the proposed Bill.
