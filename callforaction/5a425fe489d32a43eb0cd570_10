  This  Bill  seeks  to  include 

some castes of certain States in the list of Scheduled Castes. Our Constitution is the 

mirror  to  our  nation.    If  there  was  no  provision  of  social  justice,  many  of  the 

present  Members  would  not  be  there  in  this  House.    There  are  certain  castes  in 

Banka, Mungher and Jamui areas of Bihar viz Khair, Kharwar, Pujhad and Naiya.  

Such castes should be included in the list of Scheduled Castes.
