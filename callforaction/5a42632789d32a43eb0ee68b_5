    I  support  this  Bill.    Although  this  Bill  is  about 

IIITs,  it  concerns  higher  education.    Everyone  demands  IITs,  IIMs,  IIITs  and 

institutes  of  higher  education  but  nobody  talks  about  the  quality  of  education.  We 

have 'entrance' tests, but not 'exit' tests.  The amount of money being wasted because 

of  inferior  teaching  and  training  levels  is  mind-boggling.    Corporations  would  save 

much  if  the  pass-outs  are  effective  and  readily  employable.    That  will  definitely 

benefit the Indian economy immediately.  This Bill appears to be a step in the right 

direction.  By allowing industry participation in management of IITs, we will ensure 

that the right kind of exposure is provided to students before they pass out.  The Bill 

proposes a ratio of 50:35:15 for the Central, State and private investors respectively.  

It would be better if this set of ratio is not  mentioned in the law but issued through 

regulations  after  the  law  is  passed.    It  would  be  beneficial  because  then  the 

Government  can  moderate  the  share  of  each  parties  according  to  the  conditions 

prevalent  in  future.    Teacher  recruitment  is  becoming  a  serious  problem  in  higher 

education  institutes.  The  pay  for  the  teaching  jobs  needs  to  be  increased  and  made 

more and more attractive to encourage passing out students to take up teaching jobs.  

Regional  languages  should  be  promoted  in  these  institutes.  It  would  go  a  long  way 

towards attracting local talent.  India's strength is in its diversity and language plays a 

big role.
