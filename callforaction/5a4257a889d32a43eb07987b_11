 I would like to thank you for giving me 

time to speak on this important Bill. The attempt to make the hour of working from 

8 to 50 to 100 hrs is against natural justice. My second request is that it will result 

in  increase  in  unemployment  because  capital  is  meant  for  earning  profit  and  if  it 

can take more work from one person then it will not employ more person.  It is a 

global phenomenon.  Lakh-crores of youths are engaged in the unorganized sector, 

organized  sector,  manufacturing  sector  and  service  sector  on  a  salary  of  Rs.  15 

thousand  per  month.    In  the  outsourcing  system,  the  contract  system  minimum 

wage is not being paid.  They get such low salary that it becomes very difficult to 

lead  a  comfortable  life.  If  something  is  to  be  done,  it  should  be  done  for  the 

unemployed youths, they should be paid reasonable wages.  The labourer is forced 

to work more due to inflation and decline in real wages. He will throw himself in 

the work for his family. I request you to roll back this law and overtime which is 

being introduced.
