 The interest rate in the SBI has been brought 

down to 3.5 per  cent  from  4  per  cent.   ATM  withdrawals  and  online  transactions 

have been made costly.  More branches of banks are required as of now, but due to 

this merger, the number of branches will decrease.  In Punjab, the branches of the 

State Bank of Patiala spread over villages.  However, now the number of branches 

will be less resulting in difficulties to the people.  88 per cent NPA is of the public 

sector  banks.    Will  the  Government  ever  have  the  courage  to  paste  the  photos  of 

defaulting big industrialists in banks?
