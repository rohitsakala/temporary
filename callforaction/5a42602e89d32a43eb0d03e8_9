  The  information  technology  design 

and  production  institute,  Kurnool  (Andhra  Pradesh)    will  become  an  institute  of 

national  importance  with  this  amendment  in  the  Indian  Institute  of  Information 

Technology Act.  This will create employment avenues in the country especially in 

Andhra  Pradesh.    The  Government  has  already  given  the  status  of  institute  of 

national importance to four institutes.  Bihar Government has allotted 500 acres of 

land  for  IIT  in  Patna  and  construction  work  is  in  full  swing.    However,  the 

Government  of  India  has  approved  only  2-3  courses  there.    I  would,  therefore, 

request the hon. Minister to allow the Patna IIT to utilize its full potential.  Bihar 

does not have any technology design and production institute.  I would request the 

minister to approve all the courses in Patna IIT on the lines of Delhi IIT, Kanpur 

IIT,  Kharagpur  IIT  and  Mumbai  IIT.    The  courses  of  agriculture  and  food 

engineering,  hydro  science,  pure  science,  petroleum  engineering,  paper 

engineering,  B.  Pharma,  I.  Pharma  should  be  started  in  Patna  IIT.    There  is  a 

scarcity of faculty members in the Bhagalpur Engineering College which should be 

fulfilled.
