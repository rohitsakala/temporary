    Our  scriptures  teach  us  that 

seven  rivers  as  Ganga,  Sindhu,  Kaveri,  Yamuna,  Saraswati,  Rewa,  Mahamadi, 

Brahmputra  and  seven  places  as  Ayodhya,  Mathura,  Maya,  Kashi,  Kanchi, 

Avantika  and  Puri  are  givers  of  Moksha.    Waterway  should  be  made  to  link 

Vikramshila-Bhagalpur-Buxar.
