    I  welcome  that  this  Government  is 

fulfilling some of the commitments made at the time of bifurcation of the State of 

Andhra  Pradesh.  This  Bill  is  a  part  of  one  such  provision  in  the  Andhra  Pradesh 

Re-organisation Act, 2014, which stipulated that National Institute of Technology 

will be set up in the newly created State of Andhra Pradesh. The main objective is 

to  make  available  facilities  for  higher  education,  research  and  training  in  various 

fields  of  science  and  technology.  Although  we  can  boast  of  a  long  history  of 

scientific excellence, science education needs to be implemented across all layers 

of  society  and  the  benefits  to  be  made  accessible  to  the  large  population  of  this 

country.  Despite our impressive economic growth, scientific research continues to 

lack  behind.  Our  investment  in  scientific  research  continues  to  lack  behind.  Our 

investment  in  scientific  research  is  very  low  compared  to  other  developed 

countries. This must increase for the benefits to reach the poor and downtrodden. 

Science  in  India  still  has  significant  potential  for  further  development.  We  only 

seek  the  support  and  guidance  from  the  Central  Government.  I  request  the  Hon. 

Prime  Minister  to  honour  all  the  commitments  made  by  his  predecessor  in 

Parliament, including the special status to the State of Andhra Pradesh.
