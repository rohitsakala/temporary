  This  Bill  allows  the  formation  of  joint  ventures 

between  the  Nuclear  Power  Corporation  and  other  Government  companies.    We 

insist  that  nuclear  industry  should  continue  to  remain  in  the  domain  of  the 

Government  and  there  should  not  be  entry  of  private  capital  and  FDI  into  this 

sector. That will compromise our  national interest.  I would like to make it clear 

that we are not opposed to nuclear energy.    Compared to 1997, when the Kyoto 

Protocol was signed, in 2014 both wind and solar power exceeded power added by 

nuclear  sources.    All  these  are  clear  indications  of  nuclear  energy  becoming  a 

much  lesser  source  of  energy  throughout  the  world.    This  was  the  experience  of 

Japan, France, Germany, Spain, U.K. and  even the  United States.   So, we should 

not turn a blind eye towards this global experience of shifting from nuclear sources 

to  other  sources.    In  such  circumstances,  the  Government  of  India  is  investing 

heavily on nuclear energy and want to promote nuclear energy as a major source of 

our energy.  That is a flawed policy.  We should explore other sources especially in 

a country like India, where untapped hydro potential is enormous.  So, we should 

explore such untapped hydro potential more.
