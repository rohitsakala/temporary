 India is the worst affected country in the world having 

more than six core people suffering from depression and it is a fact that 78 per cent 

of global suicides are occurred due to mental instability.  We immediately require 

community based mental health care by using the public health infrastructure and 

other resources of the primary health centres in administrative structure to develop 

and monitor the progress of the programme in a centralized manner.  And to make 

it  a  success  project  immediately,  we  have  to  set  up  psychiatry  and  psycho-

orientation  department  in  all  the  levels  of  health  centres  and  hospitals  in  the 

country.  I  would  like  to  request  the  Central  Government  to  ensure  funds  to  the 

State Governments for due implementation of this Bill.  It may kindly be included 

with the schemes of the Department of Health and Family Welfare under 100 per 

cent Central Government funding.
