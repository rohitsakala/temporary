  Taxes  are  charged  in  our  country  though 

too  many  forms  of  taxes.  In  such  a  situation  our  country  has  decided  to 

implement  one  tax  for  all  by  converting  all  the  taxes  into  this  system.  In 

connection with compound taxes, those having a turnover of more than 20 Lakh 

rupees  have  to  register  mandatorily.  I  think  this  amount  is  less.  It  should  be 

increased up to 30 Lakh rupees turnover. The manufacturing companies having 

50  Lakh  rupees  turnover  will  have  to  give  one  percent  composite  tax  and 

restaurants having turnover above 50 Lakh will have to pay two and half percent 

composite tax. I would like to request the Hon'ble Finance Minister to make it at 

least 75 Lakh rupees.
