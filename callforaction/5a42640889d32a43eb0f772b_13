 There is a need either for abolition of 

or  raising  of  the  ceiling  in  respect  of  creamy  layer.    The  country  has  been 

witnessing  agitation  form  Patel  and  Jat  communities.    I  would  request  the 

government for extending the present limit of 27 per cent reservation for OBCs and 

including the agitating communities in the OBC list.  The OBC backlog should be 

filled.  OBC reservation should be provided in private sector also.
