  This  legislation  is  full  of 

ambiguity  and  loopholes.    I  feel  that  it  will  be  very  difficult  to  implement  it.  

Exemptions to employment in the house level will forfeit the entire purpose of the 

main clause.  The quantum of punishment has been enhanced.  It is very good.  But 

in the era of outsourcing 'employer' needs to be defined clearly; then only culprit 

could be found.  With regard to monitoring, Vigilance and Monitoring Committees 

headed  by  the  local Members  of  Parliament  may  have  been constituted  to  review 

implementation.    I  would  suggest  it  is  better  to  restore  the  original  clause 

categorizing 85 industries as hazardous occupation.
