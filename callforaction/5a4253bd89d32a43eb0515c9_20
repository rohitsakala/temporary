  In  Uttarakhand,  by  the  undemocratic 

way, the Government has been dismantled.  Now, the NDA is committing the same 

sins that were started by the Congress Party in 1959 when they dismissed a popular 

Government  in  Kerala.    In  the  S.R.  Bommai's  judgement  of  the  Supreme  Court, 

Court said, "Issues of majority or minority are not matters to be determined by the 

Government  or  for  that  matter  anywhere  else  except  the  floor  of  the  House."  

Therefore, let the floor test be conducted in the Uttarakhand Assembly and popular 

Government  be  installed  there.    It  is  a  shameless  assault  on  democracy  and    a 

blatant  violation  of  constitutional  norms.    Therefore,  I  oppose  this  Appropriation 

Bill.
