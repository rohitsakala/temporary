 Continuous increase in the prices of pulses, vegetables and 

other essential food commodities are not only due to a poor harvest or due to bad 

monsoon.  Global  inflation,  less  space  for  cultivation,  less  production  of  pulses, 

increased cost of production, improper management and distribution, fuel price rise 

and  increased  cost  of  transportation,  hoarding  and  intermediaries  are  also 

responsible for this situation.  It is because of the efforts taken by our hon. Chief 

Minister the ill effects of price rise on the poor and middle class people have been 

reduced considerably. Farmers are in distress, agriculturists income dropped nearly 

50  per  cent  due  to  drought.  They  borrowed  loan  from  banks  for  seeds  and 

fertilizers, but now they don't know how to repay the loan. By merely checking the 

prices  of  pulses,  inflation  is  not  going  to  be  under  control.  There  has  been  an 

overall increase in the prices of almost every commodity. All these factors need to 

be  taken  into  account  to  control  price  rise  in  India.  I  urge  upon  the  Union 

Government  to  take  appropriate  steps  to  control  the  soaring  price  rise  graph  and 

maintain the prices as lower as possible for the poor and middle class people of this 

country.
