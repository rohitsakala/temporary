  This  Bill  provides  for  establishment  of 

institutes  through  collaboration  among  the  Centre,  the  State  Government  and  the 

industry  partners.    The  capital  investment  has  to  be  borne  in  the  ratio  of  50:35:15 

among  the  Centre,  the  State  Government  and  the  industry  partner.    As  the  State 

Government has to give land measuring between 50 acres and 100 acres free of cost, 

the  expected  capital  investment  for  States  may  be  reduced  to  20  per  cent  and  the 

Centre  may  increase its  own  share to 65 per  cent, keeping  the  share  of the  industry 

unchanged.    We  welcome  the  initiative  of  the  Government  of  opting  for  the  PPP 

mode for developing such institutions. This mode of PPP should be extended to the 

self-financed institutions in the engineering and medical fields also.  The Government 

may  think  over  it  and  bring  in  a  comprehensive  Bill  for  this  purpose  in  future.    I 

would like to take this opportunity to point two issues. Firstly, confusion was created 

as  grace  marks  were  given  this  year  to  the  12th  class  students  of  CBSE.    Though 

everybody  agrees  that  there  should  be  normalisation  in  marks,  one  similar  set 

procedure  is  not  followed  throughout  the  country.    Secondly,  every  Board  has 

different  set  of  procedures  for  doing  this.    Unless  we  have  common  syllabus  and 

common  Board  there  cannot  be  clarity  on  this  issue,  and  there  cannot  be  any 

equalization in studies and marks.  So, I would urge the Government to firstly ponder 

over this aspect.
