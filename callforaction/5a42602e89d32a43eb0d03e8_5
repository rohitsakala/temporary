 On behalf of the TRS Party, 

we support this Bill.  I come to clause 3  - the Board of Governors to appoint the 

Assistant  Professors.    The  director  will  have  the  best  knowledge  of  this.    This 

clause  takes  away  the  power  from  the  Director  and  gives  it  to  the  Board  of 

Governors and members of Board of Governors, sitting in different cities. I suggest 

a via media that there should be the weightage of 50 per cent or at least 40 per cent 

of  Director's  recommendation  or  his  recommendation  has  to  be  taken  into 

cognizance  by  the  Board  of  Governors  while  selecting  a  person  for  the  post  of 

Assistant Professors. We fully support that Andhra Pradesh needs these institutions 

and they also need adequate money.  They also need a High Court.  I looked at the 

average placements across the 24 IIITs which is about 70 per cent.  Some of them 

have 100 per cent placements, including the one in Hyderabad.  What is it that the 

Hyderabad  institute  is  doing  correctly  and  what  is  it  that  the  other  institutes  are 

doing wrongly?  The figure of placement in other institutes is as low as 40 per cent 

or  60  per  cent.  IT  advancements  themselves  are  making  IT  professionals 

redundant.   They should have real foreign faculty and not some NRIs.
