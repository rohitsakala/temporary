    Several  national  institutes 

of  technology  have  been  set  up  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  The  Ministry  of 

Human Resource Development set up an NIT in Patna, Bihar and this one is 18th 

NIT and has been named as Bihar Engineering College of Patna. The population of 

Bihar is about 8.5 to 9 per cent of the total population. Therefore, there should be 

at least five NITs in Bihar on the basis of the population of the States. NITs should 

be  set  up  in  my  constituency  Banka.  The  country  will  progress  only  when  the 

villages are developed. We should go to our villages to check the pressure of ever 

increasing  urban  population.  The  quality  of  education  should  be  good.  I  would 

conclude my speech by demanding five NITs for Bihar.
