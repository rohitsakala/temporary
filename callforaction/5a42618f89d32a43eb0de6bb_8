  The  hon.  Minister  has 

presented  a  very  important  Bill  in  this  House.    This  is  a  very  important 

Amendment  as  far  as  this  country  is  concerned.    Investment  is  required  for 

installation of such nuclear plants in the country and this Bill fulfills this objective.  

Nuclear  plants  are  totally  safe.    And,  the  Nuclear  Power  Plant  of  Tarapur  is  an 

example to support this.  So, there is no need of being in fear due to such plants.
