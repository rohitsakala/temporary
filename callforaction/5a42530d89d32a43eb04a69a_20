 We have made progress in the race of renovation 

in  agriculture,  but  have  been  fail  to  get  profit  in  agriculture.  We  used  to  make 

addition  income  from  animal  husbandry  by  using  end  products  of  crops. 

Mechanization,  no  doubt,  is  our  need,  but  it  was  not  our  compulsion  to  give  up 

animal husbandry at all. It is impossible to fulfill our needs only from agriculture. 

We will have to go back towards our cherished tradition of agriculture and have to 

live  in  the  lap  of  nature.  Almost  Rs.  70  Arab  are  being  expended  on  chemical 

agriculture, while we can produce 10 time crops by using  vedic method. It can be 

used  in  water  conservation.  There  is  a  need  of  a  combination  of  scientific  and 

cherished  tradition.  There  also  a  need  to  sanctify  the  soil.  The  government  under 

the leadership of Shri Modi Ji is making effort to save nature along with the people 

of India.
