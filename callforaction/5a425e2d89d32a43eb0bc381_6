 All the hon. Members 

have supported the Bill with certain observations.  We are also trying to see that all 

the obsolete laws should be repealed as early as possible.  For repealing an Act, the 

administrative  Ministry  has  to  be  consulted.   Similarly, on  certain subjects  which 

are in the Concurrent List, we have to write to the State Governments to get their 

opinion.    I  can  assure  the  hon.  Members  that  certainly  all  the  1,863  Acts  which 

have been identified as obsolete and redundant we would take care of such laws as 

soon  as  we  get  the  concurrence  from  the  State  Government  and  ministries 

concerned.    We  are  already  working  on  automatic  repeal  clause.    This  year 

onwards  there  will  be  a  sunset  clause  in  all  the  Appropriation  Bills.    Automatic 

repeal clause is the need of the hour.  But we need to study further as to how it can 

be  done  because  it  should  not  have  any  impact  in  subsequent  days.    Dead  laws 

create confusion with the living laws. This is the observation made by the Supreme 

Court.  This is the fourth Repealing and Amending Bill that I have placed before 

this  House  in  short  span  of  six  months.    I  will  see  that  all  1,863  obsolete  laws 

would be repealed. 

The Bill, as amended, was passed.
