  Today,  it  is  high  time  in  the  country  that  financial 

institution be reformed and this is major reformatory step in that direction.  This is 

a  good  initiative  for  the  integration  of  subsidiary  banks  for  strengthening  the 

banking system.  This Government has taken a number of steps which are required 

today in the global scenario.  We must take such a concrete initiative to make the 

banks accountable towards the consumers.  Banks are accountable for Kisan Credit 

Cards, but, if an overall survey is carried out in this regard, it will be found that the 

farmers have not been meted out a fair deal here also.  Therefore, such a concrete 

step has been taken to change the nature of the banks, to make them accountable 

and consumer oriented.  I welcome and support this Bill.
