  I  fully  support  the  two  proposed 

amendments regarding the eligibility for bonus - raising the pay ceiling limit from 

Rs.  10,000  to  Rs.21,000  and  raising  the  limit  on  calculation  of  bonus  from  Rs. 

3,500 to Rs.7,000.  Most of the hon. Members from various concerns of this House 

have stated that bonus should be linked with productivity.  I would suggest that the 

productivity  linked  bonus  should  be  independent  of  and  separate  from  statutory 

bonus.   I  fully  support  the  codification of  labour  legislations.   Codification  is  the 

need  of  the  hour  and  it  is  better  for  the  performance  of  the  labour  laws  in  the 

country.    But  it  shall  not  infringe  or  takeaway  the  right  of  the  workforce  in  our 

country.    I  have  moved  a  proposal  of  an  amendment  regarding  the  ceiling  limit.  

Let  the  ceiling  limit  be  taken  away.    As  far  as  the  workers  are  concerned,  the 

wages mean only the minimum wages plus D.A. Basic wage plus D.A. is the wage 

structure.  So, my submission is, excluding the allowances this ceiling limit may be 

accepted.
