  I  salute  the  organizations  working  for  the 

cause  of  disability.    The  most  important  aspect  before  us  was  regarding 

discrimination.  Definition of discrimination was missing in the legislation but the 

Government defined this in this Bill.  It is a welcome step.  Similar is the case with 

sign language, audio visual and visual.  It is a good thing that the private entities 

have also been brought under the ambit of this Bill.  There is no coordinated move 

regarding  certificate.    There  should  be  a  universal  certificate  valid  all  over  the 

country  so  that  the  handicapped  do  not  face  problem.    There  was  five  percent 

reservation in the original Bill.  This has now been reduced to four percent.  There 

was  provision  of  punishment  for  bureaucrats  and  those  in  the  administration 

regarding  appointment  in  Civil  Services  as  well  as  in  lower  administration.    This 

has  been  diluted.    The  punishment  should  be  restored  otherwise  the  handicapped 

would continue to face problems.  There should be a branch of National Institute of 

Mental Health in Bengal for Eastern India and also for North India.  Patients from 

Eastern and North-Eastern states have to go to Bengaluru.  The patients of autism 

and such other patients should be empowered.
