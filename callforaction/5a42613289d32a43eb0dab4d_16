  It  is  my  request  that  Savitri  Bai  Phule, 

Mahatma Phule, Perriyar and Saint Ravidass be included in the educational courses 

as Savitribai Phule was the one who had brought about an educational revolution in 

India.    My  second  request  is  that  the  employment  of  the  Cobbler  and  potter  man 

should be ensured.  Reservation should be provided in judiciary.  The Bind, Beldar, 

Chai,  Tiar,  Khulwat,  Surahia,  Godhi,  Vanpar,  Kewat,  Nonia,  Surjapuri,  Kulhaya 

and Shershawadi castes should be covered under the list of Scheduled castes.  The 

government  should give priority  to  welfare  hostels  in  the  Budget.   The  education 

and  economical  freedom  of  the  scheduled  castes  and  dalits  should  be  promoted.  

The  respect  of  Scheduled  Castes  cannot  be  ensured  without  education  and 

economic revolution.  Protection should be given to the dalit students in the JNU.
