 The Nirbhaya and the Shakti 

Mills gang rape cases compelled the NDA Government to try 16 to 18 years olds 

accused of  heinous  crimes  as  adults.   I  fully  support it because  of the  increase  in 

the crimes committed by juveniles.  A the same time, we have to spread awareness 

among  the  children  and  impart  moral  education  to  them.  Then  only  we  can 

implement  these  laws.  Despite  so  many  laws  in  our  country,  these  incidents  are 

occurring.    So,  we  should  try  to  spread  awareness  among  children,  especially 

through media, people representatives, officials and schools.  It is needless to say 

that  juvenile  homes  in  our  country  are  in  pathetic  conditions.    The  multiple 

incidents of rioting, escape and violence in juvenile homes last year are a matter of 

serious concern.  The Committee of High Court Judges had also recommended that 

action should be taken to improve the conditions in these homes.  The security at 

these  homes  is  also  required  to  be  upgraded  by  installing  CCTV  cameras, 

perimeter  cordon  and  increasing  the  number  of  watchtowers.    There  is  a  need  to 

provide  psychological  support  to  the  inmates  by  allowing  family  visits.    There  is 

no  proper  health  check  up.    These  boys  need  to  be  counseled.    Boys  with  good 

behaviour  need  to  be  released  immediately.    They  need  to  be  imparted  skill 

development  training  and  vocational  education.    I  would  request  the  minister  to 

make  surprise  inspections  of  juvenile  homes  by  her  Ministry  officials  and  action 

should be taken suitably.  Finally, vacancies in the juvenile courts need to be filled 

up.
