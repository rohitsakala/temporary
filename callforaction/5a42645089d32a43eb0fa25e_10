  Moral  education  is  very  important.  Overall 

development  of  students  is  not  possible  without  it.    Moral  education  should  be 

made  compulsory  upto  class  seven.    Rich  and  poor  -  all  should  get  uniform 

education.  In foreign countries, teachers have to take examinations after three, six 

or  eight  years.    Will  the  Government  provide  for  examination  of  teachers?    The 

teachers  should  not  be  deployed  for  any  other  work  than  teaching.    Teachers  are 

meant for imparting education.  Teacher should not be a businessman or politician 

and  should  be  oriented  towards  high  moral  education.    The  salary  of  a  teacher 

should be minimum Rs. 50,000.  Bihar has almost collapsed in terms of teachers, 

schools  and  colleges.    The  government  should  improve  the  quality  of  B.Ed.  and 

D.Ed. courses.  I am also to request that the examination of CBSE should be held 

in other schools.
