  We have been making laws since our 

independence to protect the children from child labour but we have not been able 

to get rid of this problem till today.  Actually, it is the parents of a child  that are 

mainly  responsible  for  the  exploitation  of  their  child.    Therefore,  we  need  to 

legislate  a  law  to  create  awareness  among  parents  in  order  to  make  them  aware 

about  their  responsibility  towards  their  children.    There  is  no  doubt  that  the 

Government cannot shirk its responsibility but at the same time it is also necessary 

to  make  realize  the  irresponsible  parents  towards  their  responsibility  to  their 

children.  Therefore, there is a need to take a positive initiative by the Government 

in this direction.
