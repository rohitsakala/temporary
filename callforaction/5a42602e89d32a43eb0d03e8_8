 Andhra Pradesh is getting IIT, NIT, IIM, ISER, 

Central  University,  Petroleum  University,  Agriculture  University  etc.  under  the 

Andhra  Pradesh  Reorganization  Act,  2014.    This  is  a  welcome  step  and  I 

wholeheartedly  support  it.    However,  I  would  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  hon. 

Minister that these four southern states of our country have got about 40 per cent of 

all  the  institutes  in  the  country.    Bihar  is  a  state  where  there  is  no  institute  of 

national importance.  Therefore, I, would like to request the hon. Minister that the 

Central  Government should  set  up  at  least  one  institute  of  national  importance  in 

Bihar though the State Government does not  cooperate.  The situation in Bihar is 

such that there are only two engineering colleges there.  No IIM or any other big 

institute  has  come  to  Bihar.    I  am  aware  that  Bihar  Government  does  not  extend 

any cooperation and it doesn't believe in any development.  However, I would like 

to request the hon. Minister to set up at least one institute of national importance in 

Bihar especially in Champaran area.
