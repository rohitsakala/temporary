      There  are  some  issues, 

which I would like to bring before the notice of the hon. Minister. Sir, now, more 

penalties have been proposed. But there is every possibility that whenever there is 

more  proposed  penalties  in  India,  it  leads  to  rent-seeking  behaving  of  the  bribes. 

Therefore, this point needs to be addressed. Auctioning will be successful only if 

adequate quantity and quality of the mines and minerals available is assessed. Sir, 

rehabilitation and resettlement is almost worst in India, particularly in the mining 

sector. Similarly, about the  royalty, only  one-third  is being  collected. There  is no 

reason why only one-third of the royalty is being collected. This point may also be 

looked into. Presently, the coal and lignite lease holders will be depositing 25 per 

cent  of  their  profit  after  tax.  That  is  missing  here.  It  is  a  gross  injustice  to  the 

concerned State. Whatever they are supposed to deposit, they should also deposit it 

with the State Government. While auctioning, if the quality and quantity, as I was 

suggesting,  is  not  assessed  and  under-valued,  the  State  Governments  will  be  at  a 

loss  because  the  revenues  will  come  down.  If  it  is  over-valued,  the  lease-holders 

will  be  badly  affected.  So,  this  also  needs  to  be  considered.  The  interest  of  the 

lease-holders is not at all considered. When you want to bring in more investment, 

when you want to bring in  more technology, a  minimum guarantee of returns for 

the investors needs to be considered. Therefore, the balancing has to be done.
