      The  Amendment  is  very  specific.    The 

Amendment  is  very  small  that  the  alcohol  is  being  diverted  to  the  State 

Government so that the full control of the State Government should be there on it.  

It would be in conformity with the judgment of the Supreme Court and also ensure 

that  the  industries  engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  alcohol  meant  for  potable 

purposes shall be under the total and exclusive control of State in all respects.   The 

Bihar Government has announced to ban alcohol in their State.  But our experience 

is that wherever there is a ban on alcohol, there is a lot of alcohol being produced 

and  supplied  illegally  by  mafias.    So,  if  it  is  kept  free,  and  not  banned, the  State 

Government  will  also  get  money  in  the  form  excise duties;  and  such incidents  of 

consuming spurious alcohol would also not happen in future.
