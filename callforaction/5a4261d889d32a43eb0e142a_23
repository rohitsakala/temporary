 This Bill has several new amendments and 

also  addresses  several  shortcomings.    I  welcome  this  Bill  as  also  the  attempt  to 

create a Central Mental Health Authority.  The second aspect is that there is a need 

for  human  approach.    It  should  be  ensured  that  there  is  no  ill-treatment  of  the 

patients.    Such  patients  face  condition  worse  than  in  jails.    A  large  number  of 

patients  from  North  East  and  East  India  have  to  go  to  Bengaluru  for  treatment.  

Bihar,  Jharkhand,  Bengal,  Assam  and  other  North  Eastern  states  would  benefit 

immensely if an institute of the repute of NIMHANS is set up in Eastern India.  It 

would  be  very  beneficial  if  'NIMHANS'    is  set  up  in  North  Bengal  especially  in 

Raiganj.
