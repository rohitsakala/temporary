  This  enhancement  of  eligibility  limits  does 

not make any difference considering the inflation and consequent rise in the wages 

of the employees over the years since the last amendment was  made.   Almost all 

the central trade unions have demanded for the removal of conditions on payment 

of  ceiling  and  eligibility  limits  in  a  series  of  meeting  with  the  Government.    I 

request the Government to reconsider their demand in this regard and bring about a 

fresh  amendment  on  the  Payment  of  Bonus  Act  to  remove  all  conditions  on 

payment of ceiling and eligibility limits.
