 Children are the future of a country 

still  they  are  forced  on  wrong  paths.    This  issue  is  not  related  only  to  the 

malpractice  of  child  labour  but  it  is  connected  with  the  issues  relating  to  human 

rights, national security and the failure of government schemes.  We are not able to 

stop  child  labour  due  to  indifference  of  the  state  governments  and  their  corrupt 

officials.   Certain sections of the society go for unplanned family expansion as a 

result  of  which  the  children  are  withdrawn  from  the  schools  to  earn  livelihood.  

Anti-nationals  and  foreign  powers  easily  use  such  children  to  destabilize  India.  

This issue needs to be seen in the light of and integrated with the important issues 

like national security, population control and human rights.
