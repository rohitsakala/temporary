 Through this Bill, the Government is 

going  to  provide  incentives  to  factories  which  make  available  employment  for 

lesser number of days viz. the provision of 240 days has been brought down to 150 

days  in  this  regard.  Besides,  Custom  Tariff  is  being  raised.  However,  when  the 

Indirect  Taxes  are  going  to  be  covered  under  the  GST  Law,  is  there  any 

justification  for  raising  it  for  a  fewer  days?  So  far  as  promoting  the  domestic 

industries  is  concerned,  due  to  bilateral  agreement  with  some  countries,  special 

tariff  rebate  is  being  given  in  custom  duty  on  finished  goods.  However,  custom 

duty is levied on the raw material of the domestic manufacturer of finished goods 

who imports the raw material from the same country. Due to this double-standard, 

traders are reaping benefit, but the domestic manufacturers are incurring losses and 

their businesses are getting closed. As such, in my opinion, it is high time that all 

such bilateral agreements were reviewed. I think that this Bill should not have been 

brought in such a haste. More time should have been given for discussion on it.
