  Hijacking  is  one  of  the  heinous  crimes  to 

humanity.    The  earlier  speakers  have  mentioned  about  several  cases  of  hijacking 

that had taken place in the country.  Of course, the most shameful case of hijacking 

was IC-814.  An aircraft is the most vulnerable vehicle.  Any small explosion can 

cause the death of a large number of people.  That is why, the world stood up and 

took note, and in 1970, the Hague Convention was first passed.  We have taken a 

long  time  to  enact  our  own  law  in  this  regard.    The  new  Bill  defines  various 

important things.  Any flying aircraft can be immobilised with electronic jamming.  

We have not been able to develop our cybernetics to the extent that we can counter 

this.  The aircraft is also dependent on its communication with the control tower.  

If  that  is  put  out  of  action,  then  also  the  aircraft  becomes  helpless.    For  the  first 

time,  in  this  Bill,  this  technological  means  of  electronic  warfare  has  been 

mentioned.  The law has been made much better.  Airport security is in the hands 

of the CISF which is under the Home Ministry.  I would like to know how much 

control  your  Ministry  has  on  the  CISF  who  are  totally  in-charge  of  frisking, 

checking and everything.
