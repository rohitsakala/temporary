  We came into power three years back 

and since then we have succeeded to provide a corruption free government. The 

present GST Bill is another step in this direction. Our Government have taken 

several steps to eliminate corruption and bring transparency in governance. The 

first decision of this Government was to constitute SIT on corruption. Then our 

Government launched a scheme  - Jan Dhan Yojna to ensure that subsidies and 

aid are directly transferred in the bank accounts of the poor. Few days back our 

Government took decision to demonetize the currency of 500 and 1000 notes. In 

this  regard  opposition  said  that  public  is  very  much  against  this  decision.  But 

public has accepted it wholeheartedly. This is a decisive step taken by Hon'ble 

PM  Narendra  Modi  to  fight  against  corruption.  Now  this  GST  Bill  has  been 

brought  to  expand  the  economy  and  to  bring  a  major  change  in  it.  Opposition 

should findout loopholes and lacunae in this Bill and tell the Government so that 

necessary corrections could be made. GST Bill is going to change the destiny of 

the India and everyone should co-operate in this.
