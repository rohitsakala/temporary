    In  my  Parliamentary  Constituency, 

Jamshedpur,  there  is  an  industrial  city  Tatanagar.  Here  every  year  near  about  400 

accidents take place, out of which 300 persons are confirmed dead. I request that in 

view  of  this  situation  in  Tatanagar,    flyovers  should  be  constructed  in  the  city. 

Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand is also affected with the same problem. So I request 

the Government to introduce Metro Project in Ranchi.
