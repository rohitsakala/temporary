  The Government of India set up a new 

Indian Institute of Technology, Design and Manufacturing at Kurnool in the State 

of  Andhra  Pradesh  to  give  effect  to  the  obligation  under  the  Andhra  Pradesh 

Reorganization Act, 2014.  We welcome this decision.  I would like to demand that 

Odisha too deserves special consideration. An MoU was signed by Tata Company 

to open an Indian Institute of Information Technology under PPP at Berhampur in 

Odisha  but  it  is  not  in  the  list.    In  the  past  three  years,  the  Government  has  not 

shown  any  sort  of  consideration  to  our  State.  National  Institute  of  Science 

Education Research (NSER), Bhubaneswar needs to be conferred as an institute of 

national  importance.    The  Government  of  Odisha  has  also  assured  that  it  will 

extend all the support required to make this institute a world class structure.  India's 

economic  progress  rests  with  the  overall  development  of  its  rural  areas.    If 

adequate attention is given to harness the potential growth of agriculture sector by 

imparting  quality  research  base  through  use  of  scientific  and  modern  information 

technology, our progress in the sector could be manifold.  We should also think of 

establishing  Agriculture  Universities  and  such  institutions  of  excellence  in 

promoting  technology  to  cater  to  the  need  of  the  small  and  marginal  framers  in 

improving  productivity  and  production  which  would  make  them  self-reliant  and 

self-sustainable.  I  would  urge  the  hon.  Minister  to  consider  Odisha  University  of 

Agriculture Technology (OUAT) as an institute of national importance.
