  Actually,  when  the  hon.  Minister  originally 

brought this Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, he wanted to pass it straightway.  

But  like  me,  many  other  hon.  Members  proposed  that  it  should  be  sent  to  the 

Standing  Committee.    Now,  the  Standing  Committee  has  sent  a  Report  and  we 

have come with a better Bill for which I thank the hon. Minister.  The Minister has 

not  mentioned  about  the  Bus  Rapid  Transit  System  (BRTS)  which  operates  very 

well in Indore,  Ahmedabad and Curitiba in Brazil.  I want a reaction from him on 

the BRTS system to be operated throughout India.
