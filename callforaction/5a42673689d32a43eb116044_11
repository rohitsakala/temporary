  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  hon.  Minister 

wants to improve the quality and ensure adulteration free food stuff.  Through the 

House  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  that  he  should  take  steps  that  this  law 

refrains  from  strengthening  the  inspector  raj  so  as  to  avoid  giving  any  leeway  to 

the  corrupt  practices.    I  would  like  to  request  again  and  again  that  it  is  the 

implementation  part  of  the  law  where  we  lack  utterly.    Despite  the  law  being 

stringent we have to take care that this does not get confined to announcement and 

discussion alone and is really implemented effectively so that any kind of hazard to 

the  health  of  the  people  could  be  avoided  and  we  could  make  India  a  healthy 

nation.
