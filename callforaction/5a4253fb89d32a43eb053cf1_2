  India  and  Bangladesh  have  a  common 

land boundary of approximately 4097 kms.  This land boundary was determined as 

per the Radcliffe Award of 1947.  Several efforts were made to resolve the disputes 

led  by  Radcliffe  Award  during  the  course  of  the  last  more  than  60  years.    The 

present  Constitutional  (Amendment)  Bill  legalize  the  Agreement  entered  into 

between India and Bangladesh in 1974 and the Protocol entered into in 2011.   We 

urge  upon  the  Government  of  India  that  it  may  continuously  engage  in  dialogue 

and  mutual  consultation  with  the  State  Governments  concerned,  when  the 

Agreement is actually implemented on the ground. I would say that the Bill does 

not  provide  for  suitable  rehabilitation  and  compensation  measures  for  the  people 

who will be returning from the Indian enclaves in Bangladesh.  I would like to urge 

upon  the  Government  that  it  may  seriously  address  this  issue  and  provide  an 

acceptable package of rehabilitation to the people who will be returning to India.  I 

would  also  like  to  urge  upon  this  House  to  bring  a  similar  constitutional 

amendment Bill to bring back Katchatheevu Islet back to India.  In the same way, 

the Government of India should also take adequate steps to safeguard the interest 

of  the  Indian  nationals  who  would  be  staying  back  in  Bangladesh  enclaves  and 

facilitate them to acquire Bangladesh citizenship and all other attendant benefits.
