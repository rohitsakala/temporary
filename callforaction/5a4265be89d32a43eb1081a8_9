 In the context of this Bill it 

was said that this will implement the concept of 'one nation one tax'.  It is expected 

that  GST  would  also  facilitate  the  poor  states.    It  is  our  demand  that  facilities 

should  be  provided  to  the  backward  states  like  Bihar.    There  should  be  complete 

transparency  in  the  system  and  there  should  be  no  ill  effect  of  it  on  the  rural 

economy.  Special attention should be made towards small and cottage industries.  

Similarly,  use  of  Khadi  clothes  should  be  promoted  for  the  betterment  of  this 

industry.    There  is  also  need  to  pay  attention  towards  the  weaver  community.  

Now, with regard to pollution,  I would like to say that we should make endeavour 

to  curb  pollution  and  to  create  clean  environment.    We  welcome  the  corporate 

houses  so  that  industries  may  be  set  up  in  Bihar.    Taxes  on  industries  have  been 

reduced and there is a need to impose cess on it.  Similarly, special attention should 

be made towards safeguarding the interests of women and students.  In addition to  

that various posts meant for SC/ST and OBC community are lying vacant.  It is my 

request that these posts should be filled up at the earliest.
