  I  think,  the  Government  is  definitely  and 

befittingly  grating  autonomy 

to 

these 

institutions 

thereby  decreasing 

the 

Government  interference  and  increasing  the  autonomy  of  the  institutions.    Our 

State,  Andhra  Pradesh,  has  unfortunately  got  bifurcated.    Of  course,  it  was  very 

scientifically  done.    As  far  as  Central  universities  are  concerned,  we  feel  very 

lucky  that  they  are  coming  in  Andhra  Pradesh.    But,  IIM,  Visakhapatnam  is 

working  like  a  surrogate  Institute  because  there  is  no  fund.    Therefore,  you  are 

requested  to  allocated  more  funds.    Apart  from  this  ABC,  IIM  Ahmedabad,  IIM 

Bangalore and IIM Calcutta, which are well-known, to provide autonomy to other 

institutes is also a very good step.  But out of the total number of faculties, which 

are  233  or  something,  only  two  or  three  are  from  the  Scheduled  Castes  and 

Scheduled  Tribes  category  under 

the  reservation  policy. 

  This 

type  of 

representation  of  SCs  and  STs  in  our  higher  institutes  like  IIMs  and  IITs  is  most 

unfortunate.   IIMs, being the beacons  of knowledge, are the  ones  who can create 

prosperity 

through  business, 

trading,  manufacturing  and  enough  financial 

activities.    These  are  the  people  who  are  heading  the  international  institutes  also.  

For example, Indra Nooyi is from an IIM and she is heading PepsiCo.  Therefore, 

these IIMs definitely need to be boosted and more quality faculty need to be also 

given.  Regarding accountability, there is some problem.  Also, please see to it that 

they do not enhance the fees on account of their capacity to award degrees.
