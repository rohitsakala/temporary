  This  is  a  very  small  Bill  but  at 

the same time a very important Bill which is ultimately going to declare the IIIT, 

Kurnool as an institution of national importance.  Since the academic session has 

already commenced, we need to pass this Bill.  The Indian Institutes of Information 

Technology Act, 2014 confers the status of national importance to this institute.  I 

hope  that  this  institution,  within  a  very  short  time  will  rank  among  the  top  100 

institutions of the world.   The hon. Minister recently conducted a programme by 

the name 'Hackathon' challenge given to all the engineering and IT students to find 

out a solution for the public cause.  I went to the BVB College which was full of 

young students  and  they  told  that they  had  been  assigned  such  and such  problem 

and they were trying to find the solution.  33 Government Departments identified 

their  problems  and  they  were  handed  over  to  the  students  who  participated  in 

Hackathon.  If a call is given to the students and if they are encouraged, our young 

students can find out a solution which has not been found out since last 60 years.  

Out  of  29  lakh  Asian  immigrants  scientists  and  engineers  in  the  United  States  in 

2013,  9.5  lakhs  belong  to  India.    Entrepreneurship  should  also  be  a  part  of  the 

training so that they will become entrepreneurs; they will not become job seekers.  

They will become the job providers.
