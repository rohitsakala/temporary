 I appreciate the additional features of the Bill.  

They  have  taken  steps  to  amend  the  CPC.    It  is  said  that  arguments  in  the  case 

should  be  concluded  not  later  than  six  months  from  the  date  of  first  case 

management  hearing.    With  regard  to  hearing  also,  written  arguments  are  to  be 

submitted  before  four  weeks  of  the  oral  hearing  following  revised  written 

arguments,  if  any.    The  judgment  should  be  pronounced  within  90  days  after 

conclusion  of  the  arguments.    I  am  also  proposing  to  insert  a  clause  wherein  I 

propose  that  the  Court  shall,  in  addition  to  recording  the  oral  evidence  of  the 

witnesses, also ensure video recording of the same.
