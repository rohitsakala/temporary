 National Waterways Bill is a welcome step.  Rivers 

are dying in some parts and there are flood in other parts of the country.  I come 

from Assam.  Brahmaputra is a mighty river.  During British era and earlier to that 

the  river  route  of  Brahmaputra  was  the  only  route  of  transportation.    After 

partition,  the  transportation  business  has  gone  down  day  by  day.    Owing  to  that, 

transportation cost increased and people of the North-Eastern States have suffered.  

I  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  emphasise  on  development  of  river  ports  on 

Brahmaputra  as  well  as  in  the  Barak  Valley  for  hassle-free  transportation.  

Passenger  transportation  can  increase  with  inter-State  tourism  and  with  tourists 

coming  from  abroad.   Infrastructure  in  this  sector  in  Assam  is  very  poor.   I  hope 

the hon. Minister will develop Brahmaputra's infrastructure to pave the way to play 

a major role in waterways.
