 I support the Bill but I would like to bring 

to  the  notice  of  the  Government  few  demands  of  our  State.    I  would  request  the 

Central  Government  and  the  HRD  Ministry  to  prioritize  education  in  the 

Telangana  State  and  provide  the  people  of  Telangana  world-class  education  by 

recognizing the institutes in the state, providing medical colleges in every district 

and giving other important institutes to the Telangana State like the IIMs.
