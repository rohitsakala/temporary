    We  have  a  lot  of  institutions  under  the  Petroleum 

Ministry  but  the  functioning  of  such  institutions  is  not  good.    Recently,  the 

Ministry  has  appointed  a  permanent  Director  in  one  of  the  institutions.    It  is  a 

welcome step.  Only when we strive to strengthen our own industry, we can meet 

the challenges.  The first institute established in this area in 1960 is Indian Institute 

of  Petroleum,  Dehradun,  Uttarakhand  with  technical  support  of  the  CSIR, 

Uttarakhand.  The second institute came into being in 2008 in Rai Bareilly, Uttar 

Pradesh by an Act of Parliament.  As far as the Board of Governors is concerned, 

we do not have representation from the ONGC, OIDB and others institutions.  The 

Government is looking for the merger of all the oil companies to form a bigger oil 

company.    I  would  request  the  Government  to  admit  this  Institute  under  the  JV.  

But, recently, we have had many complaints about this joint venture.  It included 

incidence  of  bribe,  capitation  fee  and  so  on.    This  led  to  the  subversion  of  the 

admission process.  I would request the Minister to look into this matter personally 

especially  about  the  Rajiv  Gandhi  Institute.    Besides,  I  would  also  request  the 

Minister to start one such Institute in Cochin, as there are many major institutions 

like HPCL, BPCL and the PETRONET is also there in Cochin.
