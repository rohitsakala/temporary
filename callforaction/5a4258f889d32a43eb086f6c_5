  The  proposed  institute  aims  to  provide  high  quality 

education  and  research  focusing  on  the  themes  of  petroleum,  hydrocarbons  and 

energy.  We would like the government to start an institute of same kind in Tamil 

Nadu.    The  extraction  of  hydrocarbon  from  Tamil  Nadu  has  become  a  burning 

issue.    The  Union  Government  has  approved  a  proposal  to  extract  hydrocarbon 

from Neduvasal and other places in Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu.  This has 

raised  apprehension  among  the  villagers  that  this  may  be  a  move  to  extract 

hydrocarbons which is against the interests of the farmers.  But the government is 

unwilling  to  scrap  the  Neduvasal  hydrocarbon  extraction  project.    The  Union 

Government, instead of solving this burning issue, is adding fuel by their move to 

sign  the  MoU.    I  urge  the  Union  Government  to  stop  the  extraction  of 

hydrocarbons  in  any  form  from  Neduvasal  and  neighbouring  villages  in 

Pudukkottai.    I  also  strongly  urge  the  Union  Government  to  close  all  the  wells 

already  dug  for  pilot  projects  and  cancel  the  land  lease  agreements  between  the 

ONGC  and  the  farmers  and  handover  the  lands  to  the  farmers  ensuring  that  the 

interests of the farmers are fully safeguarded.
