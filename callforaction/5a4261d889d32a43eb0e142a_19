 Tamil Nadu is one of the best States in 

the  country  in  providing  medical  care  for  mentally  ill  people.    The  State  Mental 

Health Authority Tamil Nadu was formed in 1994.  I urge the Union Government 

to allocate more funds and support for Tamil Nadu.  Mental illnesses are psycho-

socio  biological  based  disorders  when  interfere  with  an  individual's  ability  to 

think, feel, act, and relate within the standard norms of the society.  Mental illness 

can  strike  any  person  at  any  time.    Ignorance,  fear,  misconception  and  faulty 

attitudes  regarding  mental  illnesses  are  highly  prevalent  in  rural  and  semi-rural 

areas.    Mental  health  care  facilities  have  to  be  made  available  in  all  parts  of  the 

country, even in  remote  rural  areas  and  are  to be distributed  evenly  both  in  rural 

and urban areas.  Mental health care professionals have to be increased in number.  

Mental  health  care  has  to  be  integrated  into  all  levels  of  general  health  care.  

Rehabilitation  services  for  persons  with  chronic  mental  illness  have  to  be 

expanded.    The  District  Mental  Health  Programme  is  being  implemented  in  123 

Districts across the country.  Madurai Districts of Tamil Nadu has the distinction 

of providing the highest quality mental healthcare services.  I would urge upon the 

Union  Government  to  enhance  the  medical  care  facilities  for  mental  health  care 

programmes throughout the country.
