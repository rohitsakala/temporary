  I  commend  the  efforts  of  the 

Government and the hon. Minister for coming up with this Bill.  The Bill seeks to 

prevent and control the spread of HIV and AIDS, prohibits discrimination against 

persons with HIV and AIDS, provides confidentiality with regard to their treatment 

etc.   The  Bill  lists  various  grounds  on  which  discrimination  against  HIV  positive 

persons and those living with them is prohibited.  The Bill requires that no person 

shall  be  compelled  to  disclose  his/her  HIV  status  except  with  his/her  informed 

consent, and if required, by a court order.  District Ganjam in Odisha is known as 

the  top-most  HIV  and  AIDS  prone  district  in  the  country.    There  are  no 

sophisticated hospitals to check this fatal disease and no jobs are created in those 

areas  to  minimize  the  migration  of  labourers.    Reports  say  several  patients  in 

Madhya  Pradesh  and  elsewhere  have  refused  to  take  free  medicines  and  other 

services  owing  to  the  fear  that  linking  that  AADHAAR  number  will  reveal  their 

identity and expose them.  I would request the hon. Minister to give clarity on this 

aspect as to how the Government intends to deal with this situation.
