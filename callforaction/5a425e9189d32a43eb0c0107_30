 I hail from such a state where 33 per cent 

of  urbanisation  has  taken  place.    During  the  last  three  years  25073  flats  have  been 

constructed  under  JNNURM  in  Haryana  but  the  people  have  not  so  far  taken 

possession  of  the  flats  constructed  in  Faridabad.    A  large  amount  of  investment  is 

required  to  be  made  to  translate  the  Prime  Minister's  dream  of  housing  for  all  into 

reality.  Basic facilities like schools for the children, community centres, parks and 

hospitals should also be developed along with the construction of dwellings.
