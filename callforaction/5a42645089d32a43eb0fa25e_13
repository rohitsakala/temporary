  It  appears  to  be  an  ordinary  Bill  by  which  the 

deadline of the year 2015 is being extended by another four years.  If India is to be 

made a powerful country then we have to improve the quality of education and the 

training  of  teachers  is  also  to  be  improved.    Hon.  Minister  has  said  that  the 

Government intends to make the teachers qualified through online system.  I would 

like  to  request  the  hon.  Minister  not  to  depend  on  online  system  entirely.    Hon. 

Minister  should  also  tell  as  to  how  many  more  B.Ed.  colleges  are  going  to  be 

increased by this Bill.  There is one B.Ed. college in my district which is imparting 

education  to  in  service  teachers  only  and  pre  service  teachers  are  not  getting  any 

opportunity.    My  other  suggestion  is  that  there  is  need  to  give  attention  to  the 

attendance  of  the  teachers  and  performance  of  the  teachers  should  be  improved.  

Today  enrollment  of  children  is  dwindling  down.    Children  are  eating  mid-day 

meal  but  there  are  no  teachers  in  the  classroom.    The  national  curriculum 

framework was framed in the year 2005.  We have been saying for years together 

that teachings and ideals of Shrimant Shankardev of Assam should be incorporated 

in  the  curriculum.    The  role  of  Assam  and  North-East  States  in  achieving  our 

independence should be taught in the schools.  Former Minister had announced in 

Assam  in  the  year  2015  that  14  new  Navodaya  Vidyalayas  will  be  opened  in  the 

State.    But  so  far  no  Navodaya  Vidyalaya  has  been  opened  in  Assam.    The 

statement made by Union Minister should carry some wait and should be honored.
