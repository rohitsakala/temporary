  In my home state the real estate industry is at an 

incipient stage.  The Real Estate Regulatory Authority, in each state, can be made 

through the decisions of the State Government.  Constitution grants Sikkim a very 

special status.  It is my hope that the autonomy of the State in this matter related to 

land  and  real  estate  will  be  maintained  to  allow  for  the  inclusion  of  special 

circumstances in each state, especially those in the Himalayan region.
