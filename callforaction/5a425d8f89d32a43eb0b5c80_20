  I  think  through  many  Bills  brought 

during  the  last  three  years,  including  GST,  there  is  a  continuous  attempt  by  the 

Government to compromise with the federal principles and the federal structure of 

the country, to impinge upon the rights of the States and to compromise with the 

diversity of the States and the country.  We should not centralise the powers with 

the Centre, may be economic or otherwise.
