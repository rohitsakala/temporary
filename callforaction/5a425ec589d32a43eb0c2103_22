  This  Government  has  allocated  the  minimum 

amount in terms of percentage of the GDP for defence in the last 30-40 years.  This 

means  that  our  government  has  not  been  spending  necessary  amount  despite 

having the capacity.  On the other hand, Pakistan is spending on defence beyond its 

capacity.  The government has reduced the capital allocation for defence by Rs.55 

thousand  crore  and  this  is  adversely  impacting  modernization  of  our  defence 

forces.  If the government does not have necessary resources then, I would request 

the Government to bring a proposal to levy cess for modernization of our defence 

forces  and  we shall  support  this proposal.    In  any  case, our  defence  preparedness 

should not be compromised.  There is also a proposal to impose tax on agriculture 

income which is not right.  This will hit hard thousands of farmers.  The loans of 

farmers  should  be  waived  off  but  the  Chairman  of  SBI  should  not  talk  like  this.  

This government had said that it will provide jobs to 2 crore youths per annum and 

by  this  time  about  6  crore  youths  should  have  got  employment  but  contrary  to  it 

unemployment has risen.
