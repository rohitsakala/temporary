 I would like to congratulate the 

Minister  for  bringing  this  Bill.    One  of  the  Objectives  of  this  Bill  is  to  provide 

manpower  of  global  standards.    Though  our  IT  professionals  are  highly  paid,  still 

they  are  relatively  paid less  compared  to  their  western  counterparts.   If  there  is  any 

stress  in  the  industry  and  layoffs,  then  the  first  victims  are  the  Indian  IT 

professionals.    It  is  because  mechanical  engineers  work  in  the  field  of  mechanical 

engineering;  electrical  engineers  work  in  the  field  of  electrical  engineering;  civil 

engineers  work  in  the  field  of  construction;  but  IT  engineers  and  IT  professionals 

work  in  different  fields.    Therefore,  there  is  a  need  for  not  just  exposure  to 

programming, but a need for social science, liberal arts, performing arts, and all these 

other  arts.    Many  Members  have  said  that  we  should  introduce  robotics,  artificial 

intelligence and other new technologies, but more important than that is to introduce 

social sciences in the IIITs.
