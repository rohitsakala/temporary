 As per the figures by WHO there are 

approximately  22  lakhs  AIDS  and  HIV  infected  patients  in  the  country.    The 

problem  gets  amplified  due  to  the  associated  social  stigma  and  boycott  of  the 

patients  of  this  disease.    Now  it  has  become  a  very  onerous  task  to  change  the 

mindset of the people.  Awareness campaigns are being launched and laws are also 

being  made  to  tackle  the  problem.    However,  we  still  need  to  ponder  over  as  to 

how  we  can  make  people  overcome  their  fear  psychosis  in  this  regard.    The 

proposed Bill by the Government is a positive development in this direction.   The 

Government  has  provided  for  extending  facility  of  treatment  to  the  patients, 

however,  the  proposed  premium  amount  on  insurance  has  been  kept  more  than 

normal  which  does  not  appear  appropriate.    Insurance  of  HIV/AIDS  infected 

patients should also be done on normal premium.  Welfare schemes should be run 

for  HIV/AIDS  infected  persons  and  every  effort  should  be  made  to  check  the 

spread of this disease.  It is the target of the World Health Organisation to wipe out 

HIV/AIDS  from  the  world  by  the  year  2030.    Therefore,  the  Government  may 

ensure that HIV/AIDS is eradicated from our country by this years.
