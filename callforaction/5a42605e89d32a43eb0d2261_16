  Institutes  of  Technology  are  the 

premier institutions of the country.  This Bill seeks to set up seven new IIT in the 

country.    This  is  a  challenge  also  because  even  the  existing  IITs  are  not  fully 

equipped.    There  is  also  a  dearth  of  good  quality  teachers.    Thousands  of  our 

IITians  go  to  foreign  countries  and  work  for  foreign  companies.    A  provision 

should  be  made  in  this  Act  to  ensure  that  an  IITian  on  whom  the  government 

spends lakhs and crores of rupees, serves our country at least for 5-10 years.  There 

is a need to set up an IIT like institute in the State of Haryana.  Not even a single 

IIT figures in the top 250 institutions of the world.  We provide a fixed budget of 

Rs. 100 crore to each IIT.  This is not going to make innovation.  The government 

will have to infuse more additional fund in these institutes to promote innovation 

and research.  We will have to focus on the curriculum of IITs, quality of education 

and  quality  of  research.    Secretary  level  officers  in  the  government  who  monitor 

the IITs should be from the field of technology.
