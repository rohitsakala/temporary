    I  rise  to  support  the  Bill 

introduced  by  hon.  Minister.    I  hope  and  express  my  belief  that  the  work  in  this 

regard  shall  be  completed  before  time.  Sahabganj  in  Jharkhand  State  should  be  

linked  with  this  waterways  system.    That  inland  waterway  should  be  linked  to 

Bengal.    Two  rivers  are  there  Swarnkha  and  Sone.    These  should  be  linked  with 

waterways.  Damondar river directly  merges with bay of Bengal.  I would like to 

say that this river should be linked with waterways.
