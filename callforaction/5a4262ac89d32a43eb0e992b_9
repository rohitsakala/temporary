  This  Bill  is  not  only  a  historic  but  also  a 

revolutionary  one.    But  we  need  to  observe  one-two  caution  in  this  Bill  because 

when  the  inland  waterways  would  get  operational,  there  is  possibility  of  rivers 

being  polluted  due  to  plying  of  motorboats  which  would  use  oil.    Therefore,  we 

need to make a provision in this Bill that would prevent rivers from such pollution.  

I  also  request  the  hon.  Minister  to  include  the  Narmada  canal  which  runs  from 

Kewadiya colony in North Gujarat upto Saurashtra should  be under it.  The Mahi 

river  which  is  also  known  as  Mahi  Sagar  should  also  be  included  under  the 

National  waterway.    Gujarat  has  a  long  coastal  line  of  1600  km.  and  that  should 

also  be  used  for  navigation  purposes.    Today  Mumbai  is  facing  huge  traffic 

congestion  and  to  ease  this  congestion,  sea  navigation    should  be  used  for 

passenger traffic.
