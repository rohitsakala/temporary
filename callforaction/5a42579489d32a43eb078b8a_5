 This is a good move and it should be welcomed. 

By  transferring  the  burden  of  the  liabilities  and  losses  to  private  companies,  you 

are putting pressure on them to fix these sick PSUs. For decades, these units have 

been mismanaged and now it is time to fix them up. Odisha is a producer of good 

quality  granite.  Our  Granite  industries  are  incurring  losses  due  to  cheap  imports 

from  China  and  Italy.  Customs  duty  may  be  hiked  so  that  imports  shrink  to  bare 

necessities.  We  want  the  Central  Government  to  give  tax  benefits  to  indigenous 

granite and marble factories. Our party welcomes the increase in customs duty on 

Marble  and  Granite  imports  from  10  per  cent  to  40  per  cent.  Our  party  supports 

this Bill in its entirety.
