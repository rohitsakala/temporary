  This  Bill  has  been  brought  with  a 

purpose  to  provide  legal  and  statutory  validity  to  the  currently  functioning 

Regional  Center  for  Biotechnology,  Faridabad  which  was  created  by  a  executive 

order of 20th April, 2009.  It is a welcome step.  I am of the opinion that this would 

be a significant step of the Government and it will result in rapid progress in field 

of  biotechnology  in  the  country.    This  will  facilitate  the  development  of  skilled 

human  resource  in  this  field  and  we  will  be  able  to  carve  out  our  identity  at  the 

global  level.    I  would  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  government  towards  one 

more important subject.  The hon. Minister of Science and Technology is pointing 

to a very bright future of biotechnology on the lines of IT sector.  I would like to 

urge the hon. Minister that he should also spell out the target of his government in 

this  field  upto  the  year  2019.    It  will  only  be  possible  when  the  institutes  of 

biotechnology are setup in every State as is the case with the IT sector.  I hail from 

Bihar.    In  this  regard  I  would  like  to  urge  the  hon.  Minister  that  he  should  make 

efforts  to  open  the  biotechnology  training  and  education  institute  in  the  State  of 

Bihar.
