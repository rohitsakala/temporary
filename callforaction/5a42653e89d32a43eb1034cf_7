  GST  is  indeed  a  positive 

reform  and  has  the  potential  of  enhance  the  economy  of  the  country  and  of  the 

individual states.  Further, it will enhance enforcement and collection of taxation.  

The GST will encourage supply chain mechanism which is tax compliant and self-

enforcement.    This  will  also  ensure  that  corruption  is  reduced.    However,  I  have 

several reservations.  One of the issues is the one per cent inter-State transfer tax.  

This  one  per  cent  actually  sometimes  translates  but  it  is  upto  10  per  cent.  We 

definitely  need  to  review  it.    Its  effect  on  certain  industries  is  very  detrimental.  

Also the exclusion of real estate will mean no credit will be allowed for taxes paid 

on inputs such as steel, cement, etc.  It will also dilute the benefits of GST in this 

industry.      As  I  said,  it  is  not  just  an  economic  tool,  it  can  bring  about  social 

changes.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to a very sensitive matter.  

India is  fast  becoming  alcoholic.   In  many  States, in  excess of  15 per  cent  of  the 

State annual revenues is coming from alcohol-related items.  The States should be 

allowed  to  charge  special  taxes  at  a  very  high  rate  because  they  control  harm  as 

well as it raises revenue for the states.  The Bill misses a great opportunity to bring 

about a social change.  At present, tax on alcohol is based on the price of alcohol.  

It  is  not  based  on  the  quantity  of  alcohol.    So,  I  think,  this  GST  Bill  misses  an 

opportunity  to  change  this  from  a  price-based  tax  to  a  quantity-based  tax.    This 

needs to be reviewed.  Unless all these issues, including one per cent inter-State tax 

and consensus of the Council versus voting, we cannot support this Bill.
