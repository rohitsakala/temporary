 The Government has said that the income 

of the farmers will be doubled in next five years.  Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai 

Yojana  is  going  to  benefit  the  farmers  a  lot.    Rain  water  in  hilly  areas  flows 

downwards  and  cannot  be  used  by  the  farmers  there.    So,  there  is  a  need  to 

formulate a scheme to ensure that this rain water is used by the farmers there.  The 

size of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna has been enhanced from Rs. 5500 crore 

to Rs. 9,000 crore.  National Agriculture Market has been linked with internet (e-

NAM)  with  which  farmers  can  know  the  rates  of  different  produces  in  different 

market  on  a  particular  day.    APMCs  have  been  freed  from  commission  agents.  

Agriculture credit has been enhanced to Rs. 10 lakh crore.  Of late, a good decision 

was  taken  about  soil  health  cards.    Now  the  farmers  will  not  use  unnecessary 

fertilizers.    I  would  specially  like  to  talk  about  hilly  areas.    Cost  of  carriage  is  a 

huge burden on farmers there.  The government has provided adequate budget for 

road  connectivity.    63  thousand  primary  agriculture  credit  societies  have  been 

linked  with  core  banking.    Monkeys,  boars,  blue  bulls  and  other  wild  animals 

damage  the  crops  in  hilly  areas.   I  urge  the  government  to  extend  crop  insurance 

cover  in  case  of  the  damage  caused  by  these  wild  animals.    There  is  a  need  to 

increase the budget for floriculture.
