  The  Government  is  working 

towards  the  welfare  of  agriculture  and  farmers.    If  the  farmers  use  only  required 

fertilizers after having their soil tested, it will reduce their cost as well as the health 

of the soil will be intact.   The Government is working in the direction of ensuring 

timely  availability  of  fertilizers  and  good  quality  seeds  to  the  farmers  and  for 

irrigation facilities.  The Government is formulating plans to establish cold chain.  

The Government is encouraging farmers to pursue animal husbandry and fisheries.  

The  Government  is  providing  soft  loans  to  the  farmers.    Pradhan  Mantri  Fasal 

Bima  Yojana  and  Pradhan  Mantri  Krishi  Sinchai  Yojana  have  been  launched.  

Target for agriculture credit has been fixed at Rs.10 lakh crore.  I would request the 

hon. Minister to set up cold storage at Peertand in district Giridiha, in Tundi block, 

in  Kamsar  block  and  at  Petarwar  in  Bokaro  district,  at  Uparghat  in  Navadeeh 

block.  At the same time, payment of claims under Krishi Bima Yojana should be 

made immediately in Kamsar block, Jaridiha and Petarvar.
