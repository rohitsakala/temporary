  The 

footwear  design  and 

development  institute  Bill  seeks  to  declare  this  institute  as  a  institute  of  national 

importance  but  as  per  today's  requirement,  at  least  10  more  branches  of  such 

institutes should be opened across the country and one of them should be opened in 

Bihar.    We  can  produce  skilled  human  resource  through  these  institutes.    The 

leather  industry  is  growing  by  leaps  and  bounds  worldwide  so  we  need  trained 

skilled artisans to keep pace with this industry and this would also boost our export 

from  the  country  which  is  very  less  as  of  now.    This  industry  causes  much 

pollution so the government needs to take care of this aspect.    Mostly small and 

medium  traders  are  engaged  in  this  business  and  their  economic  condition  is  not 

very good so, they are unable to set up treatment plants for the purpose.  Therefore, 

the  government  should  come  forward  and  set  up  treatment  plants  to  combat  the 

problem  of  pollution  arising  out  of  this  industry.    We  are  still  using  traditional 

machines in this industry so there is a need to provide economic assistance to this 

sector for upgradation of technology because today's world is using state-of-the-art 

technology.    If  the  quality  of  our  leather  products  would  be  good  then  it  would 

naturally boost our export.  Along with this, we need to impose a ban on imports 

from China in this sector.
