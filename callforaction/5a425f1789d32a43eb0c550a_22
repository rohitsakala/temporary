  It seems that the GST Bill is in the interest 

of  poor  States,  however,  the  Government  has  made  no  provision  of  special 

exemption  in  the  interest  of  backward  States  like  Bihar.    Hence,  the 

Government  should  consider  on  this  subject.    The  Government  should  make 

provision of giving incentive in the GST so that industries could be set up there 

also.   I  demand  this  from  the  Government.    GST  is  a  positive  taxation  system 

which  will  lead  the  country  towards  development.    After  implementation  of 

GST, the revenue of Government would increase and it will reduce tax evasion 

also.  According to the economists, it is estimated that there will be 1 to 2% rise 

in  GDP  in  the  next  3-4  years.  My  suggestion  is  that  there  should  be  an 

autonomous  monitoring  mechanism  in  the  GST  council.    The  Government 

should  adopt  lenient  attitude  and  first  all  the  proposals  of  the  GST  council 

should  be  discussed  in  the  House  and  then  it  should  be  implemented.    Hence, 

the  GST  council  should  be  completely  made  an  autonomous  body.    Provision 

should also be made for conducting audit through CAG.  I would like to request 

the  Government  that  tax  should  not  be  levied  on  all  kinds  of  food  items, 

necessary  and life  saving  drugs  and on  movement  of small  vehicles.   It  would 

provide a great relief to the common people who are facing inflation.
