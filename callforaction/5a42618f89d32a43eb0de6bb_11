 We are of the opinion that nuclear energy is 

the energy of the future.  I would urge the hon. Minister that we should deploy our 

specialist and scientist for taking care of the safety aspects of the proposed plants 

in  view  of  the  forth  coming  mega  projects.    We  have  to  ensure  that  our  nuclear 

power plants are set up in those areas where natural calamities do not strike.  We 

should top priority to the safety of the life and property of our citizens.  The safety, 

education and research should be given the top priority.
