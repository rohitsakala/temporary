 

The  Lokpal  and  Lokayuktas  Bill,  2013  became  an  Act  from  January  2014.  

Amendment  to  the  Lokpal  and  Lokayuktas  Bill  was  brought  in  the  Lok  Sabha  in 

December, 2014.   Some  of  the  provisions  of  this  Act  have  created  certain issues.  

This is the declaration of assets by several persons connected with non-government 

organizations which receive funding from foreign sources or get direct or indirect 

funding  from  the  State.   I  propose an amendment  in  Parliament today  in order to 

substitute the provision of section 44 which precisely deals with the declaration of 

assets  and  the  provision  of  making  the  assets  public.    This  is  not  the  only 

amendment  but  the  urgency  of  bringing  an  amendment  pertaining  to  Section  44 

arises from the fact that this has put a binding on us to stick to the deadline of July 

31st  for  filling  your  assets,  including  the  assets  of  the  spouses  and  children  and 

also  making  them  public,  and,  not  only  the  assets  of  the  public  servants  but  also 

assets of the NGOs.  So, in order to overcome that technicality this amendment is 

being  brought  in.    Of  course, there  are  other  amendments  which  can  be  taken  up 

later on.
