  With  regard  to  the  scheme  launched  by  the 

Government of India to provide Pucca houses to all by the year 2022, I would like to 

request that this target should be met in the year 2018 in those cities the population 

of  which  is  less  than  1  million.    I  request  that  Lakhimpur  Nagar  in  Uttar  Pradesh 

should be selected as the smart city.  The Government should set up food processing 

units, rice and sugar mills which will provide employment opportunities and help in 

poverty  alleviation.    I  request  the  government  to  launch  skill  development 

programmes in my Parliamentary constituency.
