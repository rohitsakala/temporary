    We  have  to  think  why  crimes  are 

on  the  rise  instead  of  decreasing  even  after  formulating  very  stringent  laws.  

Regarding  the  recommendation  of  the  standing  committee  it  is  not  in  favour  of 

bringing  down  the  age  from  18  years.    By  providing  education  to  the  children, 

psychological counseling and giving them the right direction they can be prevented 

from taking to crime.  It is seen specially in children of poor family that they pick 

up bad habits.  This can only be due to bad company and lack of education.  This is 

my  thinking.    The  topic  of  discussion  should  be  how  to  bring  about  a  change 

regarding this.  The children should be imparted good education and good values.  

Small  children  are  engaged  in  various  types  of  work  where  they  come  in  contact 

with  people  having  criminal  tendency  due  to  which  they  are  attracted  towards 

heinous crimes.  We need to look into this seriously.
