  First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank 

the  hon. Minister  for  providing  justice  to  the  people  belonging  to  SC community 

through  this  Bill  who  have  been  demanding  the  SC  category  status  for  them.    I 

would also like to thank the State Governments of Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Kerala, 

Odisha and West  Bengal  who  forwarded their proposal for including  these  castes 

in SC category.  Many people are living in remote villages in Maharashtra who are 

known as Dhangar by caste.  Their main profession is cattle and goat rearing.  The 

last letter in Dhangar is 'r' which was spelt as Dhangad, so the Dhangad community 

got the status of SC category.  I, therefore, appeal to all other State Governments 

including  the  Maharashtra  government  for  forwarding  a  proposal  to  this  effect  to 

the  Central  Government  so  that  Dhangar  caste  could  also  get  the  SC  category 

status who are hetherto deprived of the benefit of the same due to the last letter of 

their caste being 'r'.  I also request the government to include the fishermen living 

in coastal areas of Mumbai in the list of scheduled caste.
