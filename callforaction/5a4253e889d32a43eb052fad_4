  Abuse  against  the  children  is 

increasing  at  an  alarming  rate.    Harassment  and  exploitation  of  children  in  the 

institutions  meant  for  their  welfare  and  character  build  up,  are  also  taking  place.  

Adoption, formalities also need to be addressed.  I agree that we must have child-

friendly  legislation.  We  must  give  opportunity  for  taking  corrective  and 

reformative  measures.  I  would  like  to  say  that  over  love  and  affection  are 

dangerous.  That may even make the children crime committing type of children.  I 

do not find reducing the age of 16 illogical.  There are reformative measures in the 

Act for example when children are convicted for heinous crimes, the child would 

be lodged in a place of safety until he turns 21.  In Juvenile homes children are not 

reformed,  but  they  are  emerging  as  hardened  criminals.    They  are  exploited 

ruthlessly.    I  request  the  Government  that  the  punishment  clause  should  be  more 

stringent and very severe punishment should be given to elders who are misusing 

the children.
