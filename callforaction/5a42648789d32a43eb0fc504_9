 

I  wholeheartedly 

welcome this Bill. The first Prime Minister had mentioned: The research institutes 

are  the  temples  of  modern  India.    It  is  more  relevant  to  country  like  ours  for  the 

simple reason that years after year the population of India is increasing.  Therefore, 

to feed the ever increasing numbers, we need research, research and research in the 

agricultural sector.  In fact, we are looking forward for another Green Revolution.  

We  also  need  the  modern  technology  every  time.    Therefore,  the  Centre  for  Bio-

Technology  is  extremely  relevant.    We  are  also  extremely  happy  for  giving  an 

autonomous  status  for  these  kinds  of  institutions.    We  should  respect  the 

institutions as well as the people who are going to do the research there.  The funds 

that  we  are  allocating  are extremely  meagre.  We  have  to see  why  several  of  our 

young  scientists  are  going  abroad.    We  need  to  have  more  such  Centres.    I  hope 

that the Centres of this type will definitely curtain the brain drain.  Ethical part is 

extremely  important.    Very  poor  people,  tribals  and  people  in  the  hilly  areas  are 

being  used  as  Guinea  pigs.    That  needs  to  be  regulated.    We  request  the  hon. 

Minister to take immediate steps to establish one of this kind in Andhra Pradesh.
