  Through  this  Bill,  certain  Indian  Institutes 

of Information Technology established under public-private partnership are proposed 

to  be  declared  as  Institutions  of  National  Importance.  The  main  objective  is  to 

develop  new  knowledge  in  information  technology  and  to  provide  manpower  of 

global  standards.    These  IIIT  are  being  empowered  to  award  degrees.    This  will 

enhance  the  prospects  of  the  graduating  students  in  the  job  market.    I  welcome  the 

government's decision to set up an IIIT in Andhra Pradesh.  The autonomy provided 

to  develop  its  own  academic  programmes  including  curriculum,  new  courses  and 

method  of  assessment  will  help  in  meeting  the  student  aspirations  and  industry 

requirements.  The number of PhDs produced in India is small when compared to the 

vast  population.    India  is  also  gaining  prominence  in  terms  of  intellectual's  capital 

with several global IT firms setting up their innovation in the country.  In view of the 

recent  initiatives  taken  by  US  and  certain  other  countries  our  IT  industry  is  getting 

affected and thereby many of our software professional's jobs are at risk and majority 

of these professionals belong to the Telugu states.  I request the government to take 

steps  to  address  their  concerns  and  take  up  the  issue  with  appropriate  authorities.  

Though we have made progress in setting up institutions of higher learning they are 

not  able  to  cope  up  with  the  growing  population.    However,  to  be  able  to  lift  a 

population of 450 million out of poverty and to have them participate in the country's 

economic development, higher education needs to be a priority.
