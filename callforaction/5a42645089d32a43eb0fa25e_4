 I would say that the Right of Children 

to  Free  and  Compulsory  Education  Act,  2009  provides  a  justifiable  legal 

framework  that  entitles  all  children  between  the  age  of  six  and  fourteen  free  and 

compulsory  education.    When  you  are  talking  about  right  to  education  is  there  a 

separate budget for right to education?  If we have a separate Budget for RTE, it 

will  be  easier  for  Government  to  monitor  the  progress  of  Sarva  Siksha  Abhiyan. 

The  Bill,  of  course,  deals  with  only  one  aspect  and  that  aspect  is  relating  to 

shortage of qualified teachers, but I have full faith in the Minister. He has picked 

up one aspect, which has been pending for last so many years which should have 

been  completed  by  2013.    The  HRD  Ministry  must  be  given  due  credit  for  an 

excellent  decision  that  they  have  taken  very  recently.    The  National  Council  of 

Educational  Research  and  Training  (NCERT)  is  going  to  organize  a  National 

Achievement Survey in September this year.  This is a very welcome step. Under 

the present law, the States do not have adequate teachers. The provision to possess 

minimum qualification was relaxed till March 31st, 2015.  That date has passed two 

years ago.  Still we have an immense problem of getting hold of qualified teachers 

for imparting free education, quality education. Therefore, my amendment is that it 

cannot  control  all  these  things  at  the  Union  Government  level.    So,  allow  the 

respective states to take decision especially this is the right based law.
