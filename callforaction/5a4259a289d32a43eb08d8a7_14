  This  Bill  has  two  aspects  -  one  is  human 

immunity deficiency  virus and the second is acquired deficiency syndrome.  HIV 

decreases  the  immunity  of  a  person  and  makes  one  infection  prone.    After 

becoming  infection  prone,  a  person  becomes  infected  with  a  number  of  diseases.  

When a person is having acquired deficiency virus syndrome and we treat him in a 

hospital, that patient is discriminated against.  As a result thereof, he does not get 

several  facilities.    The  Bill  will  certainly  pave  the  way  for  providing  treatment 

facilities to the patients and the hospital staff will not be able to deny treatment to 

such patients.  Most of the HIV patients also suffer from tuberculosis.  I would like 

to  suggest  that  a  provision  should  be  made  for  making  it  mandatory  to  test  the 

tuberculosis patients for HIV infection.  This Bill will prove extremely beneficial 

in terms of providing treatment to the patients and also in terms of achieving our 

WHO mandated target in this regard.
