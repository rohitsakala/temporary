  A  sum  of  only  Rs.  5000  crore 

has  been  provided  for  the  Pradhan  Mantri  Sinchayee  Yojana.    This  is  a  very 

important scheme. So, at least Rs. 25-30 crore should be provided for the Scheme 

every year to fulfill the slogan of 'One Drop More Crop'.  The water has to be lifted 

in  my  area  for  irrigation  .    Therefore,  separate  funds  should  be  provided  for  the 

purpose.    The  farmers  of  Punjab  are  badly  debt  ridden.    I,  therefore,  request  to 

sanction a special package for them to get them rid of their debt.  The farmers of 

border  districts  of  Punjab  also  undertake  cultivation  beyond  the  fencing  erected 

around the border.  There should be a provision in this Budget for providing them 

compensation.      Wild  animals  are  causing  huge  damage  to  the  crops  of  farmers 

across  the  country  now-a  days.  So,  funds  should  also  be  provided  to  give 

compensation to farmers to make up their losses.  Similarly, more funds should be 

given  for  the  Skill  India  Programme.    A  comprehensive  scheme  should  be 

formulated  for  rainwater  harvesting.    Today,  farming  is  no  more  a  profitable 

vocation for farmers so a separate fund should also be provided  to promote dairy, 

fisheries,  poultry  and  other  ancillary  avocations  to  supplement  their  income.  

Besides,  the  farmers  loans  should  be  waived  in  the  entire  country.    More  labs 

should be set up for soil testing.
