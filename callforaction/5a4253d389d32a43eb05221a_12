  Through  the  amendments  brought  about  in  the 

laws of 1861, 1890, 1891 and 1865, cases could now be filed in all the High Courts 

of our country.  Such a provision is being made through this Bill.  This is a matter 

of  pleasure.    All  the  countries  of  the  world  admit  that  water  transport  is  the 

cheapest transport.  Despite this, the government did not pay required attention to 

this  sector.    I  would  like  to  suggest  that  in  the  new  Bill,  Bombay  High  Court 

should be named as Mumbai High Court.  I thank the government for introducing 

this revolutionary Bill.
