 The realty sector in the country is faced with two 

types  of  problems.   On  the one hand  there  is a  total glut  in the  real estate  sector.  

FDI in real estate has trickled down to about six per cent.  The Government must 

do something to push the real estate sector.  I welcome this Bill, which will bring 

transparency in the real estate sector.  This transparency brought in the real estate 

sector  will  give  a  spurt  in  the  housing  activities.    The  Bill  has  been  well-thought 

out  and  it  has  several  parts.    First  is  the  question  of  registering  any  new  project.  

But  there  the  Housing  Minister  has  a  point  that  he  has  limited  the  case  of 

application  to  500  sq.  metre.    I  want  it  to  be  reduced  further  because  there  are 

many places where only six flats are built.  I would like the Minister as soon as the 

Bill  is  passed  to  make  it  apparent  at  the  earliest  so  that  the  Real  Estate 

Development  Regulatory  Authority  is  formed;  so  that  the  appellate  tribunal  at 

different  levels  are  formed  at  the  earliest  and  also  the  advisory  committee  is 

formed at the earliest.
