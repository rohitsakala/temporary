  The most exalted aim of education is to make 

good human beings.  It appears that there are some flaws in our education system 

and  there  are  some  flaws  in  the  teachers  as  well.    Their  training  should  be 

streamlined and improved.  The Right to Education Act came into effect in the year 

2009.    The  maximum  damage  to  the  country  occurred  due  to  adopting  the  Lord 

Macaulay  Education  System  in  toto.    No  law  can  be  effective  if  it  does  not  have 

any penalty provision for those parents who do not send their children to schools.  

In the year 2006, Allahabad High Court had said that all the officers should send 

their children to Government schools if the education standard of such school is to 

be improved.  When we are ready to send our children to the Government schools, 

it  will  prove  that  development  is  taking  place.    I  would  like  to  say  that  our 

education system should impart knowledge, reasoning, compassion and skills also.
