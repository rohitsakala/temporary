  Agriculture  Sector  accounts  17%  of  our 

Country's  gross  domestic  product  and  provides  employment  to  more  than  60% 

workforce of our country.  In my State Odisha, the sector is more undeveloped due 

to  various  factors.    The  volatility  of  agriculture  in  Odisha  is  mainly  attributed  to 

low  irrigation  coverage,  an  erratic  climate  and  a  very  high  degree  of  dependence 

on a single crop.  In my State, irrigation based agriculture needs to be strengthened 

to tap the potential and bring about improvement in farming, livelihood of farmers 

and  state's  economy  to  augment  development  of  agriculture  to  engage  interest  of 

farmers,  it  is  necessary  to  do  away  with  traditional  method  of  farming  and  this 

method  should  be  replaced  with  modern  and  developed  technology  so  that 

expenditure on part of farmers could be minimized and simultaneously production 

could  be  enhanced.    The  Green  Revolution  nearly  quadrupled  the  production  of 

rice  and  wheat  but  excessive  use  of  fertilizer  and  chemical  pesticides  led  to 

degradation  and  erosion  of  soil  fertility,  loss  of  bio-diversity,  build  up  of  toxic 

nutrient in soil, loss of micronutrients and loss of useful microorganism.  So, it is 

pertinent to examine advantages and disadvantages of earlier strategy.  We should 

have a comprehensive plan to take measures for safeguard of farmers in all types 

of  natural  calamities  and  we  should  have  all  weather  irrigation  facilities  and  also 

we  should  have  developed  technology  to  use  high  yielding  seeds  to  enhance  the 

productivity.  The information centres and soil testing centres should be set up in 

every  panchayat  so  that  the  farmers  could  be  benefitted  without  bearing  any 

expense and burden.
