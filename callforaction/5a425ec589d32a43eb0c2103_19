 I have got only three quick points to mention.   

I would like to say that in a state like Meghalaya only 30 per cent of the population 

has been enrolled and has been issued Aadhaar Cards.  It is therefore, not possible 

to  make  the  Aadhaar  number  mandatory  for  Meghalaya.    I  would  like  to  request 

the Minister to look into this matter and issue a separate notification for Meghalaya 

on this issue.  Secondly, there is a proposal for merging seven tribunals.  I would 

request the Minister to explain as to why this has been done and that too at the last 

moment.    More  than  10,000  FCRAs  have  been  cancelled  by  the  Government.  

Many of thes NGOs belong to Christian minority.  I would request the Minister to 

look into this matter and not to harass all these people for small mistakes.  There is 

a provision of search and seizure.  This provision is very dangerous in terms of tax 

men who have a free will to go wherever they want without any accountability.
