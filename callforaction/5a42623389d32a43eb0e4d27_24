  There  is  a  need  for  further 

improvement  in  this  Bill.    We  all  know  that  work  is  being  taken  from  small 

children.    Whenever,  we  stop  at  a  railway  station  or  a  bus  stop,  we  watch  small 

children undertaking different works.  We watch serials in which small children are 

working.    However,  we  have  not  been  able  to  find  out  how  to  check  it.    The 

Government has not arranged for the rehabilitation of the children engaged in child 

labour  so  far.    The  government  should  arrange  for  their  rehabilitation.    There 

should  be  a  rehabilitation  centre  in  every  district.    However,  the  bigger  districts 

should have such a bigger centre where arrangement for education and other things 

should be made for the children.
