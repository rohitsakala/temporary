  Hon.  Minister  said  he 

believes that this industry has a potential to grow like the IT industry over the next 

ten years and beyond.  Biotechnology will have a huge positive impact on various 

sectors.  The more important things are agriculture, healthcare and vaccine.  There 

is  a  scope  where  existing  Centres  can  be  taken  over  by  this  Centre.    I  think  that 

may  not  be  very  desirable.    The  other  independent  Centres  at  Hyderabad, 

Thiruvananthapuram    and  the  other  23  Centres  also  need  to  be  encouraged.    The 

Department of Biotechnology is providing teaching programmes in 71 universities 

across  the  country.    I  think  the  Centre  needs  to  take  cognizance  of  the  States 

schemes also and what they are doing because that is very significant. The Bill is 

silent  on  the  affiliation  of  these  Centres  after  the  passing  of  the  Bill.    Clause  17 

says that two members can be nominated by the UNESCO and three members by 

Member  States of  UNESCO.   Is  there  a scope of losing the  real  autonomy?    The 

Biotechnology  Regulatory  Authority  of  India  Bill  was  introduced  in  2013  and 

lapsed in the Fifteenth Lok Sabha.  I think that needs to be revived.   A Hyderabad 

company has already developed a Zika virus vaccine.  We developed the rotavirus 

vaccine  at  50  per  cent  of  the  cost  available  in  the  US.    Cheapest  vaccine  for 

Hepatitis B was developed in Hyderabad.  In Hyderabad, we already have a policy.  

Recently, our hon. Chief Minster announced a pharma city.
