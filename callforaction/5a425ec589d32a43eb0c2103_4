 During the last two years, the Indian economy 

has  been  affected  by  the  weak  monsoon.    However,  despite  that  the  Government 

showed  such  an  efficiency  that  the  World  Bank  data  also  contends  that  the  GDP 

growth of India during 2016-17 remained at 7 per cent and during 2017-18, it will 

remain  7.6  per  cent  and  during  2018-19,  it  will  be  7.8  per  cent.    In  terms  of 

manufacturing capacity, India was at 9th position in the world earlier which it has 

improved  to  attain  the  6th  position.    The  rate  of  price  rise  has  remained  static  at 

around  5  per  cent.    This  is  a  successful  example  of  the  economic  policies  of  this 

Government.  The fiscal deficit which was around 3.5 per cent last year, has been 

targeted to be kept at 3.2 per cent during this year by the hon. Finance Minister.  In 

the  budget  and  the  Finance  Bill  of  this  country,  it  has  been  kept  in  view  that 

economic  progress  of  the  villages,  the  poor,  the  farmers,  the  dalits,  the  deprived 

and the exploited classes is ensured in a better and in the minimum possible time.  

This  step  with  regard  to  the  GST  will  take  this  country  towards  the  biggest 

economic  reforms  since  Independence.  More  than 95  per  cent  companies  belong 

to  the  MSME  sector  in  the  country  and  provide  employment  to  the  people.    Tax 

burden  for them  has  been  reduced.   I  belong to  the state  of Chhattisgarh  and  this 

state has been constantly facing the scourge of left wing extremism.  I would like 

to  appeal  the  hon.  Finance  Minister  to  frame  policies  and  provisions  for  the 

development  of  all  the  development  blocks  in  our  left  wing  extremism  affected 

areas, even if the districts may not be covered for this purpose.
