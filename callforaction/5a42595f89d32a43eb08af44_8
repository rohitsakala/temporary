  The  Bill  also  amends  four 

other laws  as  explained in the  Bill.   All the provisions in this Bill  are very  much 

needed  for  the  country  at  this  time.    So,  the  Bill  is  indeed  welcome.    But  does  it 

meet the objectives?  Does it meet the required goals?  The Bill proposes a Central 

Registry  that  integrates  the  records  of  transactions  related  to  secured  assets  of 

various registration systems in Companies Act.  The intent is very well, but can it 

ever  be  implemented?    Unfortunately,  in  our  country,  land  and  real  estate  assets 

cannot  uniquely  and  immutably  identified.    It  is  because  there  are  not  thousands 

but  lakhs  of  assets  and  you  need  identification  systems.    I  am  very  glad  that  the 

farm land belonging to farmers does not come under the purview of this Bill.  But 

what  about  the  farm  land  owned  by  corporate?      I  think  it  should  be  treated  as 

corporate asset.  There are a lot of solar companies which are in distress and they 

have  taken  huge  loans  by  keeping  thousands  of  acres  of  farm  lands  as  collateral 

security.  I think, we also need to look at the DR policy.
