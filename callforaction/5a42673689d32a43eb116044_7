 The Bill includes goods, services and system and it also 

defines goods, services, processes and system.  So far as certification of goods and 

services  is  concerned,  the  Bureau  would  be  the  licensing  authority  for  quality 

standards.  A lot of duplicate products are being marketed throughout the country.  

How can government work out self-certification in the country?  The Bureau can 

establish  and  maintain  testing  laboratory  for  quality  assessment  and  conformity 

assessment  for  the  goods,  services  and  articles.    I  would  like  to  know  from  the 

Minister  the  condition  of  the  present  laboratories  in  our  country.    We  certify 

25,000  goods  and  services  every  year.    How  can  that  be  possible?    Without 

sufficient instruments in working condition how can it be possible to give 25,000 

certificates  to  goods  and  services  every  year.    Hallmarking  is  used  to  certify 

precious  metal  articles  like  silver, gold, platinum  and palladium.     In  our  country 

the  annual consumption  of gold is over 500 tonnes in  2015.  How  can  the  present 

offices  and  laboratories  fulfill  this  requirement  of  our  country?    As  regards 

mandatory  certification  of  goods,    I  would  like  to  request  the  Minister  to  include 

food  items  also.    A  serious  look  by  the  Government  is  necessary  as  far  as 

standardization  of  food  items  is  concerned  in  our  country.    A  provision  of  Rs.5 

lakh  penalty  is  there  in  this  Bill.  I  think  it  should  be  increased  to  a  sufficient 

amount.  How will the consumers get benefit from different agencies?  I would like 

the Minister to clarify this.  20 per cent of the medicines which are produced in our 

country  lag behind prescribed standards.  Moreover, some  of  these  medicines  are 

banned in other countries.  So, we have to look into this seriously as it would affect 

the health of our people.
