  I  would  have  been  very  happy  to  speak 

supporting the Bill if the House had been in order.  But unfortunately, the House is 

not in order.  Six Members have been suspended.  As far as the Bill is concerned, a 

new Indian Institute of Information Technology being set up at Kurnool in Andhra 

Pradesh  was  already  there.  But  it  was  called  Indian  Institute  of  Technology, 

Manufacturing  and  Design.  I  would  like  to  suggest  that  national  course  or 

curriculum for all Information Technology courses all over the country should be 

enunciated so that there is standardization of Information Technology education in 

the  country  and  students  are  not  taken  for  a  ride.    I  again  repeat  my  appeal  to 

withdraw the suspension of six Congress Members and also mete out equal justice 

to Mr. Mann and a Member of the Ruling Party who has violated the rule.
