    We  consider  workers  as  a 

very  valuable  asset  for  the  country.    It  is  only  because  of  their  hard  work  and 

patience that India is growing at a very fast pace.  As we all know, for any industry 

or for any society, wealth is important.  If the industry is doing well and if they are 

having  wealth,  the  wealth  should  be  shared  by  the  workers  and  the  society.    I 

would  suggest  the  hon.  Minister  that  bonus  also  should  be  linked  up  with 

productivity then productivity will increase in this country. When the trade union 

politics  should  be  minimised  in  the  industries  then  only  the  productivity  will  be 

increased.    We  are  insisting  on  all  the  companies  to  increase  their  CSR  to  two 

percent.   I  would  also  like  to  suggest  the hon. Minister  that, at  least, one percent 

profit of every company should be given to their employees in the form of bonus in 

addition  to  what  this  Bill  proposes  to  give.    We  should  always  try  to  give  social 

security  and  safety  to  our  workers.    We  have  very  weak  labour  laws  even  after 

independence.    We  have  to  make  stringent  labour  laws  for  the  welfare  of  the 

workers  of  the  country.    I  want  to  congratulate  our  hon.  Minister  for  bringing  a 

wonderful Bill for the welfare of the workers of this country.
