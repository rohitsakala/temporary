  The  Government  may 

kindly exempt the persons from income tax who are having an annual income up to 

Rs.  5  lakh  from  income  tax.    The  long-term  capital  gains  tax  on  immovable 

property  be  reduced  from  two  years  to  one  year  as  in  the  case  of  stock  market.  

Since the NDA Government came to power in 2014, the cesses and surcharges are 

being  routinely  increased.    They  used  to  constitute  just  12  per  cent  of  Gross  Tax 

Revenue in 2014, presently, they constitute about 18 per cent which is very high.  

In spite of great focus of 'Make in India' programme and despite global commodity 

prices  falling  by  over  60  per  cent  in  the  last  two  years  and  the  entire  country 

becoming power surplus, the manufacturing sector in India is not picking up.  The 

Budget  for  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Farmer  Welfare  was  increased  from  Rs. 

48,072 crore in 2016-17 to Rs. 51,026 crore in 2017-18, an increase by six per cent 

for  a  sector  on  which  more  than  60  per  cent  of  the  population  depends.    In  the 

Finance  Bill,  2015,  certain  tax  concessions  were  extended  to  States  like  Andhra 

Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal and Bihar.  But what Andhra Pradesh should be 

given  are the  tax  concessions that  were  extended  to  Special  Category  states.  We 

request to kindly grant the same to Andhra Pradesh to enable it to catch up with the 

other states because of division of the state.
