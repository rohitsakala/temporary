  I,  not  only  support  this  Bill  on  behalf  of  the 

Telugu Desam party, but also we congratulate the Minister for having conducted a 

lot of Handicap Camps in Andhra Pradesh.  There are certain glaring omissions in 

this Bill.  Motor Neuron Disorder is one such  disease.  The famous scientist, Mr. 

Stephen Hawking, used to suffering from this disease, yet he had achieved a lot of 

things.  Schizophrenia and Depressive psychosis has also not been mentioned here.  

Excepting  those  who  are  visually-handicapped,  hearing-handicapped,  locomotor-

handicapped, they are unfit to use the reservation.  There are persons who are 40 

years or fifty years of age but they behave as though they are two year or three year 

old  children.    Instead  of  giving  reservations  to  those  handicapped  persons,  let  us 

give financial support to those families.  My another suggestion is that instead of 

giving  reservations  to  the  handicapped  person,  the  brother  or  sister  or  any  of  the 

persons  who  are  taking  care  of  these  persons  can  be  given  reservation.    We  are 

giving pension of Rs. 1500 to all the handicapped persons in Andhra Pradesh.
