  With  regard  to  the 

imposition of the Compensation Cess to protect the domestic products against the 

imported  ones,  I  could  not  understand  the  logic.    Of  course,  there  is  a  need  to 

protect  the  local  manufacturers.    At  the  same  time,  we  should  encourage 

competition  amongst  the  manufacturers.    Therefore,  the  Compensation  Cess  may 

not  be  relevant  in  the  present  day  competitive  marketing.    Secondly,  it  removes 

several cesses and surcharges and makes the taxation system quite simple.  It is a 

welcome  feature.    As  regards  the  abolition  of  cess  on  water,  it  will  definitely 

hamper the local panchayats as they are running short of sources of revenues.  So, 

it needs to be reconsidered.  Perhaps, if the CSR is implemented with a lot of faith 

and  zeal,  this  gap  between  the  urban  areas  and  rural  areas  can  be  reduced.  

Similarly,  we  now  that  the  entire  State  wealth  has  been  concentrated  in  one  per 

cent of the people.  So, the tax reforms should also focus on how to bridge the gap 

between the rich and the poor and the rural areas and the urban areas.  Secondly, 

every  time  we  harp  on  infrastructure.    But  there  is  no  focus  on  building  rural-

infrastructure.  So, it is high time that the Government focuses on rural areas rather 

than on urban areas.  There are a lot of loopholes in the system.  So, the loopholes 

should be plugged so that we can collect more taxes which would be beneficial to 

the people.
