  Let  us  be  very  frank  to  appreciate 

reservation and making a Commission for the OBCs, SCs, STs, etc.  Whatever Dr. 

Ambedkar had said in this regard is the first and final thing in our country and we 

accept that.  I am not opposing clauses 1,2 and 3.  But I am opposing clause 4, that 

is  insertion  of  new  article  342A.    By  way  of  this  Constitutional  Amendment, 

Central  Government  wants  to  take  away  the  power  of  the  State  Governments.  

Under  article  141  of  the  Constitution  of  India,  the  power  of  enacting  the  law  in 

identifying  the  backward  classes  has  been  entrusted  by  the  Supreme  Court  to  the 

State Governments.  This power has been given by the Supreme Court to the States 

and  not  to  the  Union  of  India.    Identification  is  to  be  made  by  the  State 

Government; identification  would  not  be done by  the  Central  Government.  Who 

knows  in  my  state  which  are  the  backward  classes?    Article  16(4)  empowers  the 

State Government to make reservation for other backward classes.  Under the veil 

of  a  Constitution  Amendment,  they  are  hitting  the  federal  structure  of  the 

Constitution.    Nobody  is  having  a  right  to  hit  the  basic  structure  of  the 

Constitution.  I may point out to you as to what the Government is trying to bring 

under  Article  342(a).    The  President  may  with  respect  to  any  State  or  Union 

Territory and where it is State after consultation with the Governor.  Consultation 

may  mean  that  I  will  talk  to  you  over  telephone  and  you  may  or  may  not  agree.  

The word 'consultation' here has no meaning.  Why should the State Governments 

have  to  depend  upon  the  whims  of  the  Central  Government?    By  bringing  this 

Constitutional amendment they are hitting the federal structure of the Constitution.
