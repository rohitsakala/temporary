 This is one of the finest drafted Bill that I have 

ever  come  across.    Things  like  mood  perception,  behavioural  disorder  which 

impairs  judgementa  and  things  which  are  functional  in  nature  should  have  been 

categorized as behavioural disorder and not as mental illness.  The Bill talks about 

only  one  disorder,   that  is schizophrenia  though  there  are  five or six disorders  as 

per the Psychiatry Association.   The Government over-enthusiastically is trying to 

classify even the maniac psychosis which is called bipolar disorder as a psychiatry 

illness.      In  psychiatry,  the  disorder  most  frequently  seen  is  the  bipolar  disorder 

and the manic depressive psychosis.  The intention of the Government seems only 

to treat a disorder where a person would only threaten himself and the society.  I 

request the hon. Minister that the definition of mental illness should include mood 

disorders,  behavioural  disorders,  perception  disorders,  and  those  disorders  which 

impair the ability of judgment.
