  It  is  very  unfortunate  that  we  still  have  no 

reservation Act.  As 117th Amendment had been passed in Rajya Sabha but it has 

not yet been included in the Lok Sabha.  In the Nagaraj case, every State is facing a 

lot  of  difficulties  in  implementing  reservation  in  promotion,  especially  in  the 

Central Government.  As a measure of social justice, I request the hon. Minister to 

kindly  bring  out  the  Constitutional  Amendment  so  that  not  Court  should  accept 

these challenges against the reservations especially in promotions.  I urge upon the 

Government  to  make  a  sincere  effort  in  making  a  reservation  Act,  and  to  make 

sincere  effort  in  giving  reservation  in  All  India  Judicial  Service  so  that  when  it 

becomes  Government  Service,  at  least  the  SCs  and  STs  will  become  judges  in 

Supreme Court and High Courts.
