  The  hon.  Minister  has 

proposed  the  names  of  20  hon.  Members  for  the  Joint  Parliamentary  Committee 

but  we  do  not  see  a  single  woman  Member  in  that  list.    There  are  a  number  of 

experienced  and  learned  women  Members  sitting  on  the  Treasury  Benches.    So, 

my request to the Government and to the hon. Minister would be to include at least 

one woman in the proposed list of the JPC.
