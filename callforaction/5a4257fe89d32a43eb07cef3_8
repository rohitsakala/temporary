  I  believe  that  proposed 

Bill will definitely bring out good legal reforms in India.  We also strongly believe 

that  justice  delayed  is  justice  is  denied.    Therefore,  just  as  the  hon.  Minister  has 

suggested  the  timeframe  in  the  Arbitration  and  Reconciliation  Act,  perhaps  the 

timeframe should also be put in respect of some of the cases, particularly the cases 

of  commercial  nature.    We  all  know  that  there  is  a  huge  backlog  and  a  large 

number of vacancies in courts.  Unless that is taken care of, any number of creating 

additional  machineries  may  not  solve  the  problem  of  the  accumulation  of  cases.  

While  the  power  has  been  given  for  the  Chief  Justice  of  the  respective  courts  to 

nominate the Judges as far as the Special Courts are concerned, I would request the 

hon.  Minister  that  a  special  mechanism  could  be  evolved  where  trained,  efficient 

and  honest  Judges  could  be  considered.    Now,  we  are  evolving  the  multiple 

systems.    So,  we  should  ensure  that  the  multiple  bodies  should  not  affect  the 

existing legal system.  Again, three-fourths of the under-trials are coming from the 

minorities, dalits  and  tribals.   The  hon. Minister  may  kindly  look  into  this  aspect 

and  try  to help the  weaker  sections of society.   It is  the need of  the hour that  the 

Government takes up steps to establish the Indian Judicial Services as well so that 

they  are  accountable  and  answerable  like  all  other  Civil  Servants.    I  would  also 

request  the  hon.  Minister  to  kindly  consider  the  various  aspect  of  the  Summary 

Judgment without recording the oral evidences and see how it could be effectively 

implemented.
