 If the wealth is concentrated in the hands of one 

person  then  he  will  have  the  power  to  get  any  post  in  the  world  by  the  use  of 

money  power.    Therefore,  the  first  thing  to  ensure  is  that  the  purchasing  power 

should not be concentrated in the hands of one person.  Money should be dispersed 

in more and more hands.  The government has allowed big hospitals and schools to 

be run by big capitalists.  The industrialists earn immense wealth by forming trust.  

The  government  provided  land to  Apollo  hospital  for  one rupees  and  the original 

mandate  was  to  give  free  treatment  to  the  poor  but  it  is  a  open  secret  that  not  a 

single poor patient is treated there despite the hospital possessing free land worth 

billions  of  rupees.    I  have  two  suggestions  to  make.    First  is  that  the  property 

belonging to a trust, hospital or a school should never be allowed to be run by an 

NGO at any cost.  NGOs in India posses maximum amount of black money.  There 

is a need to bring a stringent law to recover black money in India.
