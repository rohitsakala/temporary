 Workers engaged in both the 

organized  and  unorganized  sectors  should  be  given  bonus.    But  workers  are  not 

duly  compensated.    It  would  be  better  if  poor  workers  are  provided  bonus.  

Government must pay particular attention towards women workers.  As we know, 

workers pave the path of prosperity for our country.
