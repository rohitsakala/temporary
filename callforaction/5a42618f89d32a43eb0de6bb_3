  Contribution  of  nuclear  energy  is 

very  less in  the  total  production of  power  in  the  country.     One  of  the  reasons of 

adopting atomic energy is that it is cheaper.  Many hon. Members have supported 

nuclear power projects but many others have expressed that nuclear power can be 

dangerous  to  human  life.    Many  foreign  companies  are  likely  to  enter  into  joint 

venture  in  nuclear  power  projects  but  unfortunately  many  foreign  companies  are 

there on which question marks have been put.  The French company namely Areva 

is  a  blacklisted  company.    Wherever  did  this  company  work,  there  were  safety 

issues.  We are not opposed to the nuclear power project at Jaitapur per se but we 

definitely are opposed to the location of the plant and the company through which 

it is proposed to be established.  Jaitapur falls in seismic zone-IV.  The atomic fuel 

of  the  project  would  be  disposed  into  the  sea  which  would  result  in  increase  of 

marine  temperature.    This  will  adversely  affect  the  marine  life.    What  provisions 

has  the  Government  made  for  the  lakhs  of  fishermen?    Many  scientists  have 

submitted a report on Jaitapur project to the Government.  The Government should 

consider  this  report  because  establishment  of  atomic  energy  project  at  such  a 

vulnerable location is not safe.
