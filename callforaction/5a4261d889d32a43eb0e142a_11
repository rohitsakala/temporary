 It is unfortunate that such a sensitive matter 

related to the mental patients has been neglected so far.  Now, this government has 

brought comprehensive Bill in this regard.  It is a fact that awareness has increased 

with  regard  to  mental  illness  in  the  urban  areas  but  still  there  are  many  people 

suffering  from  mental  illness  in  the  villages  of  our  country  because  rural  people 

are  not  aware  of  and  sensitive  towards  mental  illness.    Illiteracy  and  poverty  are 

also  the  main  reasons  behind  mental  illness.    During  2010,  number  of  people 

suffering  from  mental  illness  were  2  crore  which has now  reached  upto  13  crore 

and as per the estimates by 2020 their number is likely to be increased to 25 crore.   

The  concerns  being  expressed  over  this  disease  in  this  House  and  the  extent  to 

which  this  Bill  is  garnering  people's  support  are  the  manifestations  of  the  inner 

compassion.    This  Bill  enshrines  all  the  provisions  regarding  the  protections  and 

rights  of  the  persons  suffering  from  mental  disorder.    The  detailed  clarifications 

regarding  the  representative  will  benefit  the  patient  a  lot.    A  mass  awareness  is 

also required to be created about this disease.
