  The  present  Bill 

is 

comprehensive  and  includes  access  to  health  care,  treatment,  rehabilitation, 

insurance,  right  to  choice  of  treatment  but  most  importantly,  decriminalizes 

attempt  to  suicide  and  regulates  mental  establishments.    These  vulnerable 

individuals  need  support  and  care.    Mental  patients  face  social  stigma.    Public 

needs to be aware.  They need to be accepted in the society and they should not be 

confined.    There  need  to  be  a  Budget  for  creating  awareness  through  TV  and 

media messages etc. They need access to mental health care.  There are only about 

3,500  psychiatrists.    We  need  more  institutions  like  NIMHANS.    We  need 

psychologists and they are even more scarce in the country.  Bill has a provision 

for insurance cover of mental illness.  But irony is that Government cannot force 

insurance  companies  to  cover  such  persons.    There  is  a  lacuna  in  the  Bill  and  it 

does  not  protect  the  property  of  the  mentally-challenged  people.    Another  very 

important  point  is  to  distinguishing  and  codifying  behavioural  disorder  from 

mental disorder. Otherwise, criminals will take shelter on this.
