    This Bill is  a  milestone in  bringing 

reforms.  The taxation system under GST should be so much easy that there is 

no scope for tax evasion.   The present Government has created faith among the 

people to a large scale due to which the attitude of the people regarding paying 

tax has changed certainly.  As per the Bills five slabs of taxes have been fixed 

under  GST.    Moreover  there  is  a  provision  of  15  per  cent  cess.    Certainly  the 

financial losses arising out of the implementation of GST will be compensated 

by the cess.  Neither the classification of goods have been done nor the slabs of 

taxes on there have been fixed.  It is a must to bring petroleum products under 

the GST but the time period to bring it under GST has not been fixed.  All the 

grants have determined taxes and cess on these products as per then commenced 

and have endowed the maximum amount.   If the same trend goes on in future 

then the aim of GST- one tax one nation- cannot be achieved.  Lastly, I would 

like to know that it is not justified to give the right is to punish the person who 

dwells charges.  The higher officer of the Income Tax Department should not be 

given the right to punish.  I am of the view that the Government must reconsider 

it.
