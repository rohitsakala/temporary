 The Smart Cities Mission is flawed as it can be 

declared  by  states  based  on  their  whims  and  fancies.    It  should  be  replaced  with 

Census  towns.    The  existing  allocation  is  also  arbitrary.  The  rounding  off  of  the 

score which each State received inconsistent.  Telangana State should get at least 4 

Smart  Cities.    There  should  be  a  separate  category  of  "Smart  Metros"  under  the 

Smart  Cities  Mission  for  the  metropolitan  cities  of  New  Delhi,  Mumbai,  Chennai, 

Kolkata  and  Hyderabad.  Very  few  Slum  Free  Plan  of  Action  (SFPOAs)  are  being 

submitted  by  the  state  governments.    The  Standing  Committee  recommended  that 

the Centre provide states assistance in preparing SFPOAs.  This should be taken up.  

The  Centre  should  introduce  a  public  housing  upgradation  scheme  modelled  on 

Singapore's  Selective  En  Bloc  Redevelopment  Scheme  (SERS).    Need  to  allot 

houses in slum  redevelopment projects jointly in the name of husband and wife or 

solely in the name of the wife.  There is a case for providing 'infrastructure Status' to  

Affordable Housing Sector.  The Employment through Skill Training and Placement 

(EST&P) guidelines must be amended to enhance the tracking period.  Currently 6 

months is too less, it should be at least one year.  There should be special emphasis 

on  skill  development  and  employment  enhancement  in  construction  sector 

(including  housing  sector).    The  Building  Materials  and  Technology  Promotion 

Council must get adequate funding.  This is meant to showcase latest  technologies.  

There is a need to properly monitor construction of night shelters by HUDCO.
