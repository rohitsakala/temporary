  Our  hon.  Minister  of  External 

Affairs is striving to resolve the issue which was pending for many years, through 

this legislation.  The Shiv Sena wholeheartedly supports this Bill and also assures 

the  Government  that  our  party  would  always  support  all  efforts  to  make  the 

country  safe  and  secure.    This  Bill  will  resolve  the  disputed  territorial  issue 

between India and Pakistan but one very important issue still remains to be solved 

is that the issue of illegal Bangladeshis and other foreign nationals residing in India 

illegally  should  also  be  resolved.    The  Government  should  make  efforts  to  send 

them  back  to  their  original    countries.    Many  of  them  have  got  ration  cards  and 

have also been included in the electoral rolls and have also got voting rights.  The 

children  were  working  illegally  in  many  states  especially  in  Maharashtra  are  all 

coming  from  Bangladesh.    I  would  like  to  inform  this  august  House  and  the 

concerned  ministry  that  the  Government  should  pay  attention  to  making  all  the 

territory and coastal area safe and secure so that no foreign nationals or terrorists 

could enter India.
