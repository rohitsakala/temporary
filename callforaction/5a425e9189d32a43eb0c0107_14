  I  would  like  to  bring  into  the  notice  of  hon. 

Minister that though department is trying hard to meet the target to provide houses to 

all upto 2022.  Poor and middle class people are watching very closely the move of 

Centre and State Government regarding their long waited low cost housing schemes 

by the Government.  In a city like  Mumbai were housing industry real estate is not 

functioning in a right manner due to lack of co-ordination between bureaucracy and 

developers.    The  official  concerned  are  not  taking  right  decision  and  clear  the 

proposal  in  time.  At  present  the  entire  focus  is  on  the  slum  dewellers.    The 

Government should take responsibility to take care of slum dwellers.
