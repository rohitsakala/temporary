  The proper implementation of the Bill 

would  bring  a  radical  change  in  the  system.    I  would  like  to  suggest  the  ho. 

Minister  as  to  why  should  not  we  start  it  at  the  level  of  primary  and  secondary 

schools.  There is a need to provide reservation for at least 5 percent seats for the 

disabled kids in private schools.  The disabled persons should be provided facilities 

at  the  public  places.    The  Bill  should  also  provide  facilities  to  the  parents  of 

disabled children in the public transportation system.
