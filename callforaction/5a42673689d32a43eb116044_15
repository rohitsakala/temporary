  There are numerous instances in which due to 

lack of effective standardization policies, millions of customers are cheated.  It has 

been proved that the dreadful disease, cancer has been spreading in the country as 

people are forced to consume products which contain toxic materials.  There is no 

proper  quality  checking  of  the  contents  of  a  food  stuff.  The  newly  built  bridges 

fall, buildings collapse, roads develop potholes, sometimes soon after construction 

and  plastic  used  is  of  questionable  quality.  This  is  because  of  faulty  or  lack  of 

certification  policies.  Alphonsa  mangoes, other  fruits  and  vegetable  were rejected 

by  the  Western  countries.  All  these  instances  prove  that  the  standardization  and 

quality control mechanisms followed are not up to the mark.  Hence, I compliment 

the  Government  to  have  taken  the  timely  and  bold  steps  to  introduce  this  Bill  to 

ensure safe, quality, pure and credible products.
