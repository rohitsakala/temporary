 By amalgamating many Central and State taxes 

into a single tax, the GST would mitigate double taxation and would eventually 

pave  the  way  for  a  common  national  market.  When  implemented,  the  CGST, 

SGST/UTGST  and  IGST  would  be  levied  at  rates  to  be  mutually  agreed  upon 

by the Centre and the States in the GST Council. I would like to suggest that the 

details of all these taxes may be made more simpler. Similarly, the payment to 

Government  and  subsequent  refunds  be  minimised  or  kept  at  a  minimum 

possible level. The division of administrative control over tax-payers need to be 

reconsidered.  Regarding  the  power  to  collect  GST  in  the  territorial  waters  and 

its further delegation to the states, I feel the Act should specifically mention this 

and it should be made a part of the Act itself. As for the organizational structure 

and deployment of human resources, I feel the Ministry of Finance should place 

report of the working group on the Table of Parliament.
