  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  providing  me  an 

opportunity to speak on the Anti-Hijacking Bill, 2016.  I would also like to say that 

the compensation should not be determined on the basis of somebody's origin.  An 

organization should be raised on the lines of NSA to tackle the emergency situation 

like plane highjack.  As far as the security checks of VIPs are concerned, national 

security should not be compromised at any cost.
