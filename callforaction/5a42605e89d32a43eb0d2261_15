  The  Government  has  enacted  this 

Act  to set up  six  more  IITs  and  to upgrade  ISM, Dhanbad to the  status of  IIT.   I 

thank the government for this.  I hope the government will set up these IITs soon 

and make them operational too.  IIT Patna has not been made operational till now.  

That is operating from a polytechnic even today.  At least one more IIT should be 

set  up  in  Bihar  according  to  the  population  of  the  State.    Affordable  education 

should be provided to the poor students.  The government spends huge money on 

students  in  the  IITs  and  they  go  to  foreign  countries.      The  government  should 

ensure that they serve in the country at least for 10 to 15 years.  The government 

should provide student credit cards for IIT and NIT students so that they can get a 

credit of Rs. 25-30 lakh and they can concentrate on their studies.  On the lines of 

Right  to  Education,  the  government  should  extend  Right  to  Employment.    More 

and more research centers should be established so that our students get more and 

more facilities to work in R&D.
