    This  Bill  seeks  to  amend  the  First  Schedule  of  the 

Industries  (Development  and  Regulation)  Act,  1951  to  exclude  the  production  of 

alcohol for potable purpose from the ambit of the said Act.   The Bill confines to 

the Supreme Court's decision.  I would like to ask the hon. Minister what its affect 

will be on taxation and other things.  We are going to introduce GST and alcohol is 

one of the subjects not covered under it.  Whenever we amend any law, we have to 

change it for few more years, not for the present purpose only.  So, I would request 

the Government that whatever amendment to a law is placed before the House, it 

should  not  be  to  fulfil  only  the  direction  of  a  court.  This  195  Act  itself  gives  an 

advice  to  the  Centre  to  prepare  a  Council.    So,  I  would  like  to  know  from  the 

Government whether the functioning of the Council is up to the mark as effective 

functioning of the Council is also very much required to establish the system in a 

smooth way.
