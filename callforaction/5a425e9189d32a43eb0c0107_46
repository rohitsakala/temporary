  I  congratulate  the  Hon'ble  Minister  of 

Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation for allocating 5075 crore for Pradhan Mantri 

Awas Yojana. More than half of Hyderabad lives in "bad" environmental conditions. 

Around  70,000  households  in  Greater  Hyderabad  limits  do  not  have  individual 

toilets  and  75-79  per  cent  people  are  still  defecating  in  the  open.  As  per  Census 

2011,  Hyderabad  has  17,903  homeless  people  and  25,560  street  children.  Specific 

measures  like  creation  of  urban  shelters,  school  drives  and  skilling  programmes 

should be conducted for this category of people. For PMAY-U the Ministry should 

consider a better eligibility structure.
