  I  support  this  Bill.    I  hope  this 

institution  would  be  invested  in  making  the  country  self-reliant  in  the  field  of 

energy.    The  oil  prices  are  at  its  lowest  level  of  the  last  10-15  years.    But  the 

common man is not benefitting from it.  I would like to request the hon. Minister 

that  the  benefit  of  reduced  prices  should  reach  the  poor  also.    The  prices  of 

domestic LPG should not be beyond the reach of the common man.  I come from 

Bihar.  An ambitious project namely 'Haldia-Jagdishpur Pipeline Project' is being 

executed  there  by  the  government.  I  would  request  the  hon.  Minister  that  the 

network  of  this  pipeline  project  should  be  extended  across  the  State  of  Bihar,  so 

that the common man could get clean fuel at lower prices.
