  Holding  fair  elections  is  an  integral  part  of 

Indian  election  system.    I,  through  you, would  like  to  make  a  request  to  the  hon. 

Minister of Law and also would like to make a suggestion that earlier ballot papers 

used to be  mixed  and  then  counted  and  the same  practice  should  also be  adopted 

now and the EVM of a village should be connected to a system where the votes are 

counted collectively and the whole counting is presented in one go.
