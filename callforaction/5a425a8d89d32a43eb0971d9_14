  As  far  as  issue  of 

inordinate delay is concerned, I would like to place it on record that a letter from 

the Election Commission had come to us on 26th November, 2015.  We processed 

everything.    In  the  present  Session  we  are  placing  it  so  that  it  should  be  passed.  

We had detailed discussions with the Election Commission of India. They said that 

they may require seven to eight weeks for this purpose.  If we are able to pass this 

Bill,  we  will  be  able  to  give  them  the  voting  rights  within  the  stipulated  period.  

Central  Government  is  certainly  here  to  give  all  sorts  of  assistance  to  the  State 

Government  to  see  that  all  those  persons  who  came  from  Bangladesh  should  be 

rehabilitated  and  should  be  given  all  basic  facilities.    There  is  clarity  when  the 

enclaves are exchanged between the two countries and there is no confusion as far 

as that matter is concerned.  I would, therefore, request that the Bill may kindly be 

passed. 

 

The Bill was passed.
