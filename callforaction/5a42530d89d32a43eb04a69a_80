  While  discussion,  the  budgetary  allocation, 

made  for  the  agricultural  sector,  I  would  begin  by  expressing  my  protest.    I  am 

asking the Prime Minister to spare some time to meet the all party delegation from 

Kerala and listen to the problems of the southernmost state, Kerala which is facing 

acute drought.  Thrissur Ponnani Coal Development Samiti and Kuttanad package 

depend on Central Government funding.  During the last NDA Government's time 

Rs. 454 crore was allotted for the Thrissur Ponnani Coal Development Samiti.  As 

a  Chairman  of  this  body,  I  request  the  Government  to  increase  the  funding  of 

Thrissur  Ponnani  Coal  Development  Samiti  and  enhance  paddy  cultivation.    The 

Central  Government should  also  continue to  fund  the  Kuttanad  package  as  it  is  a 

centrally  funded  scheme  which  is  of  great  importance  to  Kerala.    Many  of  the 

agrarian economies in the world are giving upto seventy percentage subsides to the 

farmers.  The Indian farmers too should get increased subsidy, so that agriculture 

too becomes a profitable employment.
