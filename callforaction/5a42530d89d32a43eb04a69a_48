  The  problems  faced  by  the  marginalized 

farmers,  youth,  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  have  been  forgotten 

totally.  The common man including the farmers has been hit hard by the effect of 

demonetization.  Added to this, the drought across the nation has broken the back 

of the Indian agriculturists.  The farmers are toiling in a debt trap.  The Karnataka 

has been facing consecutive drought for the last one and a half decade.  During the 

year  2015-16  more  than  160  taluks  were  declared  drought  hit  by  the  State 

Government.    The  state  of  Karnataka  has  suffered  crop  loss  to  the  tune  of  Rs. 

17,000  to  Rs.  18,000  crore.    Karnataka  has  requested  the  central  government  for 

Rs.  4,702  crore  for  drought  relief  works  as  per  the  norms  of  the  NDRF,  but  we 

have  not  received even  that  amount.   Further, the  Centre has  sanctioned only  Rs. 

1,782.44  crore.    It  is  not  even  50  %  of  the  amount  the  government  of  Karnataka 

requested.    In  Karnataka  during  the  year  2015  total  1197  farmers  committed 

suicide.  Hence I urge upon the Union Government to take immediate measure to 

rescue the farmers be waiving off the loans taken from all the Nationalised Banks 

(commercial  banks,  cooperative  banks  and  regional  rural  banks).    I  also  impress 

upon  the  union  government  issue  necessary  directions  to  all  the  banks  to  extend 

fresh short term crop loans and medium/long term loan to farmers.  Many states in 

India  particularly  in  my  state  Karnataka  farmers  are  suffering  huge  losses  due 

elephant,  wild  board,  Monkey,  Deer  and  various  other  wild  animals  menace.  

Farmers are often forced to engaged in distress sales, i.e. selling below the MSPs.  

I would also like to suggest the government to include more crops under the ambit 

of MSP.
