  As  per  the  census  of  2011,  more  than 

46  lakh  of  our  younger  generation  is  involved  in  child  labour  in  one  way  or  the 

other.  I am sorry that the government has not put any restraint with regard to the 

working hours of the children between the age of 14 ad 18.  It means that the Right 

to  Education  is  only  for  the  children  upto  14  years  of  age.    There  should  be 

vacations in schools during the agricultural time so that classes of the children are 

not  missed.    Earlier,80  industries  were  banned  for  children  for  being  hazardous 

which has been brought down to three.  Detailed discussion should have been held 

before  bringing  down  the  number  of  hazardous  industries.    Opposing  the  Bill  I 

would like to submit to the government to refer this Bill to the Select Committee so 

that it could reconsider the Bill for a number of mandatory amendments essential 

for  the  development  of  this  country,  to  take  ahead  the  life  of  the  children  and  to 

ensure a safe and healthy life  for the children.
