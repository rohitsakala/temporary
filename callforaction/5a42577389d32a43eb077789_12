    I  congratulate  the  hon.  Minister  and  his 

colleagues for bringing today an extremely important Bill.  I am firmly of the view 

that a day will come when India would be at the top and we can say with pride that 

in Science and Technology we are second to none.  New Kendriya Vidyalayas and 

Jawahar  Navodaya  Vidyalayas  have  been  sanctioned.    At  several  locations  even 

after two years these have not started functioning.  The Government should review 

the number of Kendriya Vidyalayas without hostels.  The Government should see 

to it that institutes are not concentrated in one location while other large parts are 

neglected.  Crores of students in Western Uttar Pradesh are deprived of education 

simply because there are only private engineering colleges which are fake.  There 

is  no  institute  there  to  offer  science  and  technology  education.    Will  such  a  day 

come  when  students  in  Europe,  America,  Australia,  Japan  and  Korea  would  say 

that  they  are  going  to  India  for  their  studies.    Today,  several  private  sector 

institutes are recognized.  Kindly review the norms for recognizing such institutes.  

Huge  amounts  are  realized  from  these  institutes  for  granting  recognition.    The 

amount  paid  in  turn  is  realized  from  the  students.    Today,  the  future  of  these 

students 

is  uncertain. 

  Our  education  system  has  become  completely 

commercialized.  One hostel should be constructed on priority basis at Sarsawa.
