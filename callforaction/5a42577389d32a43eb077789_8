  I  hail  from  Bihar.    Bihar  has  a 

population of about 12 crore and students of Bihar are always going out to other 

educational institutions for studies.  I would like to request the hon. Minister to set 

up  such  institutes  in  Bihar  also.    Nalanda  University  of  Bihar  had  been  a  world-

renowned  institute.    Students  of  Bihar  are  very  studious.    I  would,  therefore, 

request the hon. Minister to establish at least one such institute in Bihar.
