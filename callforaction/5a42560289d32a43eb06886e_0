  In  this  small  Bill,  ceiling  the  is  proposed  to  be 

increased  from  Rs.25/-  to  Rs.200/-  per  quintal  under  section  3  (1)  of  the  Sugar 

Cess Act, 1982.  At present, per quintal cess is Rs. 24/- against Rs.25/-.  This cess 

is to be increased from Rs. 24/- to Rs.124/-.  Currently, the amount  collected from 

cess is Rs.500 crore which is likely to increase to Rs.2500/- crore with the increase 

in the cess.  Secondly, there is a provision for soft loan under which an interest free 

loan of Rs.4100 crore will be given for a year to the farmers of those sugar mills 

who have paid 50 per cent of the dues.  If we provide Rs.500 crore yearly in the 

Cane Development Fund, then the same will be used for its development.  Thus, a 

total  of  Rs.3000  crore  is  required  for  this  purpose.    We  have  formulated  several 

schemes in this regard.  The arrear of farmers has gone up to Rs.5068 crore and the 

old arrear is Rs.1025 crore. Thus, the total arrears of farmers is more than Rs.6000 

crore. The farmers are facing problems and the development of the sugar-mills is 

not  happening.  There  is  no  modernization  of  mills  and  hence  additional  fund  is 

required.  I believe this is an important move in the interest of the farmers and the 

sugar industry.  I appeal to the House to pass it without any debate.
