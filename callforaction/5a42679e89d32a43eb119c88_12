 The Act was brought in 1981 by late Shrimati 

Indira  Gandhi.    It  was  the  result  of  her  vision  for  the  farmers.  Today,  this 

Amendment Bill has come mainly to increase the authorized capital of NABARD 

from  Rs.5,000  crore  to  Rs.30,000  crore.    Moreover,  the  allocation  of  fund  under 

PMKSY  is  Rs.1000  crore  but  he  has  released  only  Rs.415  crore  up  to  January, 

2017.  So, the intention of the Government to help the farmers is only on paper not 

practical.    There  is  one  of  the  slogans  of  this  Government  -  'Har  Khet  ko  Pani'.  

The  allocation of  Rs.1000  crore  is there  for  micro irrigation components  whereas 

the  released  amount  is  only  Rs.461  crore.    So,  the  words  of  this  Government  are 

not  in  line  with  what  they  have  promised.    Under  the  Tribal  Development 

Programme, there is no fund sanctioned by NABARD for the year 2015-16 in the 

North Eastern Region.  In my constituency, we have an area where people produce 

turmeric which is one of the best turmeric in the world.  The farmers  approach the 

banks for loans, but they cannot avail the loan due to the cumbersome process of 

banks.  So, I would request the Government to have special consideration for these 

people especially in my State.  In my State, there is one of the rarest earths which 

is very good for pottery.  So, I would request that loans to these types of people, to 

the small farmers should be extended so that farmers of this area will be benefited.
