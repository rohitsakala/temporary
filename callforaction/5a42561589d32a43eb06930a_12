 In view of the old legislation, we are bringing in 

reforms in a manner we are able to invest in a new class of investments which has 

not  been  stated.    We  need  to  bring  all  the  different  Acts  which  today  govern 

different  charities  of  the  country  into  one  umbrella  so  that  w  are  able  to  better 

secure the way in which these are regulated.   I would like to know whether the old 

laws  within  the  State  of  Sikkim  which  regulate  some  of  our  Trusts  and  Charities 

there would be impacted by this.
