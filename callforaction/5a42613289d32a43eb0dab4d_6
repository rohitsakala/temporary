  The  people  belonging  to  scheduled 

caste got the benefit of reservation by virtue of the Poona Act and for this they had 

to struggle a lot.  The main intention and spirit of our founding fathers was that if 

the  reservation  policy  is  implemented  in  letter  and  spirit  then  the  people  of  SC 

community  would  come  into  the  mainstream  of  the  society  but  this  was  not 

implemented that way.  This is the reason that this community is still neglected and 

backward  even  after 70  years  of  independence.   Three universities of the  country 

were declared as central university at the time of independence.  They are Banaras 

Hindu University, Delhi University and Aligarh Muslim University.  The policy of 

reservation  is  being  fully  implemented  in  the  BHU  and  Delhi  University  while 

appointing teaching and non teaching staff.  But the Aligarh Muslim University has 

not  been  implementing  the  reservation  policy  thereby  depriving  SC  and  other 

backward classes from this benefit.  The successive governments of Uttar Pradesh 

have  not  raised  this  issue  in  all  these  70  years.    If  more  and  more  castes  are 

included  in  the  list  of  Scheduled  Caste  like  this  then  the  interest  of  other  caste 

which are already there in the existing list would be adversely affected because the 

Supreme  Court  has  pegged  the  limit  at  50  per  cent.    I,  therefore,  request  the 

government to consider on this aspect also when any such proposal comes to it in 

future.
