  I  would  like  to  present  before  this  august 

House  some  of  my  concerns  regarding  the  Child  Labour  (Prohibition  and 

Regulation)  Bill.  I  would  like  to  highlight  the  ambiguity  in  the  definition  of 

children which is below 18 years as per the UN Convention on Rights of Children. 

The  Bill  contradicts  the  Right  to  Free  and  Compulsory  Education  Act,  2009  as 

legislated to fulfill article 21 of our Constitution. There is a flaw in the process of 

listing hazardous occupations. By allowing the adolescents of 14 to 18 years of age 

in non-hazardous occupation, it  is  being discrimination to those  children  who  are 

equally vulnerable like those who are below 14 years of age. The Bill is required 

more  measures  to  strengthen  the  role  and  accountability  of  the  enforcement 

machinery in terms of rescue, post rescue processes and rehabilitation.
