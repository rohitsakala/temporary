  Nuclear  energy  is  not  only  source  of  power 

generation  but  also  pertinent  to  various  aspects  of  human  life.    It  has  a  big 

importance in the field of health, agriculture and agro products.  This bill has been 

brought to remove some of the legal impediments in the way of nuclear energy.  I 

support this Bill.  I would also like to request that Rajoli in Nawada  in Bihar was 

identified as  a possible site for setting up of a nuclear power plant  10 years ago.  

Therefore, I request the hon. Minister to look into over this issue.
