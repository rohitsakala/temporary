  The  Government  should  not 

bring a legislation in such a cavalier manner.  I think it will further aggravate the 

unemployment scenario of the apparel sector.  So far as marble sector is concerned, 

marble industry is forced to sell out at higher prices for importing finished marble 

from  countries  like  China  and  Indian  marble  industry  is  seeking  Rs.  2000  crores 

for open permit and removal of import limits.  They are also seeking open general 

licence.  If rough marble is allowed, we can import and become competitive by re-

exporting  finished  marble  after  value  addition  leading  to  huge  foreign  exchange 

earnings.
