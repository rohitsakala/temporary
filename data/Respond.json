term.The case against the prime minister stemmed from the Panama Papers leak last year, which spurred a media frenzy over the extravagant lifestyles and high-end London property portfolio of the Sharif dynasty.All these review petitions are dismissed, said Supreme Court justice Asif Saeed Khosa who oversaw the five-member review panel.In a long-winded appeal demanding that his case be reviewed, Sharifs legal team presented 19 points challenging the courts judgement, saying the ruling suffered from errors floating on the surface.The Supreme Court has also ordered the countrys anti-corruption watchdog, the National Accountability Bureau, to open a criminal case against Sharif, his sons -- Hussain and Hassan -- and his daughter Maryam.Last month Sharif led legions of supporters from the capital Islamabad to his hometown, Lahore, in a days-long procession that brought thousands into the streets in a show of force.During the trip Sharif repeatedly blasted the courts actions, saying the decision was an insult to Pakistanis.The latest ruling comes days ahead of a by-election to fill Sharifs parliamentary seat in Lahore that is being contested by his wife Kalsum,

the anti-terrorism law, is a matter of extreme gravity that would have serious consequences as it amounts to an aggression against the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Islamic Waqf (trust), which has the jurisdiction in this matter, and all Muslims.Momani urged Israel as the occupying power to immediately revoke \"this politicized and provocative decision\" and live up to its obligations under the
