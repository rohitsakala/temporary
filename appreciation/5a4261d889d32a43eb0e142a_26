 First of all, I thank the hon. Prime Minister and 

the hon. Minister of Health profusely for introducing this Bill.    The 

country 

witnesses  six  times  deaths  due  to  suicide  than  by  murders.    Those  who  commit 

suicide comprise very qualified people as well as those lacking in education.  This 

is  a pointer towards the  fact  that something is  amiss in our system.   The  modern 

science  was  in  denial  of  anything  like  mind  until  very  recently  and  mind  was  a 

non- entity for them.  Only recently, the subject of mind and mental disorders find 

a  place  in  the  mainstream  medical  education.    It  is  only  in  furtherance  of  this 

concept  that  now  95  per  cent  of  the  diseases  are  considered  psychosomatic  in 

origin.  We are making provisions for providing facilities to the mental patients in 

this Bill.  The Ayurveda gives detailed prescription about the need to control the 

mind  under  which  a lot of  stress  has  also been  given  on the  dietary  regime.   For 

every  single  rupee  being  earned  by  the  government  as  taxes  on  alcohol  it  has  to 

spend  two  rupees  to  deal  with  the  various  after  effects  of  its  consumption.    The 

Government will have to give a serious thought to it.  The Government should also 

ponder  over  seriously  to  discourage  the  use  of  psychotropic  substances.    The 

people  fail  to  pursue  the  right  treatment  option  due  to  the  culture  of  sorcery  and 

exorcism.    The  government  should  strike hard  against  the  people practicing  such 

professions.  The Government should also pay attention towards providing clothes 

and other facilities to the homeless mental patients.
