  The Government is not against the Lokpal Bill.  

The  Government  is  committed  to  work  against  corruption  and  to  implement  the 

Lokpal as it is approved by the House.  The Government is ready to make it even 

more stringent if that is the recommendation given to us.   

The Bill was passed.
