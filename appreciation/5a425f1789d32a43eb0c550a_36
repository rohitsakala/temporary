  The  biggest  ever  economic  reform  after 

independence  is  coming  through  the  amendment  to  the  Central  Goods  and 

Service  Tax  Bill  in  the  country.  With  the  introduction  of  Goods  and  Service 

Tax,  the  prices  of  the  items  will  be  reduced  and  the  tax  rates  may  also  come 

downwards  in  days  to  come  thereby  benefitting  the  common  man  directly.  In 

the field of construction, the tax rates are likely to come down from 30 percent 

to  18  or  20  percent.  It  will  boost  the  foreign  and  domestic  investment  in  the 

country.  Through  this  Bill,  efforts  have  been  made  to  remove  the  hurdles 

coming in way of progressing industrialization and development of the country. 

Moreover,  this  bill  will  help  in  strengthening  the  basic  condition  of  backward 

districts of the country.
