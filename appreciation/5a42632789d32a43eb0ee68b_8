  I  think  this  Bill  will  have  far-reaching  implication  in  the 

field  of  higher  education,  particularly  the  engineering  education  in  our  country.    I 

strongly object to the reduction in the number of reserved seats in these institutions.  

A recent report which appeared in the newspaper said that in 2017 itself nine per cent 

drop out has happened in IIITs.  They are mainly from the reserved categories.  The 

vacancies  reserved  for  teaching  faculty  in  the  IIITs  are  still  not  filled  up.    The 

Government  is  going  to  move  their  control  completely  and  hand  over  these 

institutions to the private market.  That will not help our future generation.  I request 

the  Government  to  rethink  and  re-frame  the  entire  Bill  and  give  adequate 

representation in teaching faculty and student seats in these institutions so that we can 

create  more  engineering  students  and  more  responsible  persons  in  the  engineering 

filed in the future.  We produce more than eight lakh engineering students every year 

but  the  unemployment  in  the  engineering  sector  is  60  per  cent.    I  request  the 

Government to give utmost importance to creating jobs.
