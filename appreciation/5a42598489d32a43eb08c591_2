  On their inception decades 

ago,  all  NITs  were  referred  to  as  Regional  Engineering  Colleges  and  were 

governed by the respective State Governments.  In 2002, the then HRD Minister, 

decided  to  upgrade  all  RECs  to  National  Institutes  of  Technology.    In  2007,  the 

Indian  Government  declared  these  schools  as  institutes  of  national  importance.  

The NIT Council is the supreme governing body of India's 31 National Institutes of 

Technology system.  I would request the Government to provide certain number of 

seats  for  poor  and  deserving  students  recommended  by  the  respective  State 

Governments.    NIT  Andhra  Pradesh  has  been  set  up  to  cater  to  the  needs  of  the 

State of Andhra Pradesh which did not have NITs.  Declaring it as an institution of 

national importance, it will ultimately help in addressing the aspirations of people 

in  the  main  stream  of  technical  education.    I  would  also  request  the  Union 

Government to allocate more funds for such highly commendable and performing 

NITs in the country.
