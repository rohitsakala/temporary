  God  has  bestowed  upon  us  this 

body  composed of  five  elements of  nature.  We  need  to  understand  the utility  of 

this body.  We can maintain good health if we follow a disciplined routine.  This 

Bill  touches  upon  all  the  related  subjects.    During  the  last  50  years,  a  good 

progress  has  been  made  in  the  treatment  of  mental  diseases.    One  among  four 

persons  is  a  mental  patient.    Many  mental  patients  are  wary  of  getting  treatment 

for their illness.  The symptoms of mental illness varies from person to person and 

it depends on the diseases inflicting the person.  The list of mental illness is long.  

Mental illness gradually turns into serious madness.  Some ill-informed people try 

to  treat  patients  suffering  from  mental  illness  through  local  exorcists.    Mental 

health experts can treat most of the mental diseases, therefore, there is a need for 

mental healthcare hospitals at all places.  I would also like to mention about music 

therapy.    A  very  good  work  is  being  done  in  the  field  of  music  therapy  in  the 

Dattatreya  ashram,  Mysore  in  Bangalore.    I  would  make  a  request  that  a  mental 

healthcare hospital should be opened at Koilver near Patna in Bihar.
