 I wish to express my sincere gratitude to our 

beloved leader Hon. Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for giving me this opportunity 

to speak on the Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2016. The Bill seeks to 

add six new Indian Institutes of Technology in Tirupati, Palakkad, Goa, Dharwad, 

Bhilai and Jammu. Tamil Nadu has become a hub of education in the country and 

has got a special place in global scenario. In Tamil Nadu we have one of the best 

IITs  in  the  country  â€“  the  IIT  Madras.  The  hon.  Chief  Minister  has  recently 

launched seven global R&D centres at the IIT Madras Research Park. The centre is 

expected  to house  more than  250 scientists and engineers. IIT-Madras  has signed 

Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  foreign  universities  resulting  in  cooperative 

projects and assignments. For all these innovative programmes, IIT requires more 

faculty members, more research departments, more student intake and more funds.
