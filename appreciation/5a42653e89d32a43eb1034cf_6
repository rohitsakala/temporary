  GST  would definitely  pave  the  way  for  smooth 

tax administration.  With one stroke of the GST Bill, our country would become a 

very attractive destination.   I feel that there is a need to create IRS (GST) All India 

Service.  The GST officers can go to the States and administer the State GST and 

the  Central  GST  also  very  effectively  because  these  are  the  CBEC  IRS  officers 

who  are  well  trained  in  the  indirect  taxation,    indirect  tax  collections  and  they 

understand the notifications and litigations.  At the adjudication stage, it is not very 

clear  in  the  Bill, where  the  appellate  authority, how  the  adjudication  process  will 

take  place  and  how  it  is  going  to  be  resolved.  The  limit  of  Rs.  10  lakh,  which  is 

envisaged in the proposed Bill, we doubt whether it is going to be misused.  If that 

happens,  instead  of  expecting  1.2  or  1.5  per  cent  GDP  growth,  we  may  lose  that 

much back.  This is the Bill which is  making history in India after 1947 to make 

India economically  very  strong.  I  think this is one of  the historic  Bills to  reduce 

the common man's burden of purchasing the goods and services from the market.  

Businessmen  are  also  looking  for  a  lot  of  industrial  growth,  a  lot  of  industrial 

setting up so that employment generation also will increase.  The country is going 

to  get  benefited  with  the  introduction  of  GST.    I  also  besiege    upon  all  my 

colleagues,  let  us  support  the  GST  Bill.    By  deferring  it  or  by  sending  it  to  the 

Standing  Committee,  we  are  going  to  lose  one  year.    Let  us  make  tax 

administration  also  as  smooth  as  possible  by  utilizing  the  best  services  of  the 

Central Board of Excise and Customs.
