  Waterways  is  the  cheapest  mode  of  transport.  

Also accidents are less in the Waterways.  In the coming days the more we make 

use of the waterways the more our GDP will grow and more and more people will 

get employment.  The people belonging to Koli community were providing travel 

service  to  people  from  Mumbai  to  Varsova  to  Mudjetti  Road  for  Rs.  10.    The 

Custom  Department  got  their  services  stopped.    I  thank  the  Minister  for  giving 

permission in this regard.  It is my demand that this matter should be looked into 

and  the  concerned  officers  should  be  investigated  and  full  report  should  be 

presented in the House.
