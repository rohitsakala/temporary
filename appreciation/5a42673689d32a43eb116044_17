  BIS  is  a  an  autonomous  body  and 

has  been  working  properly  since  the  last  29  years  when  the  ISI  rules  were 

implemented in the country for the first time. The proposed amendments are being 

made in view of global competition. The monitoring system under proposed laws 

should  be  more  strict  and  effective  for  ensuring    the  quality  of  any  product  or 

goods. The agency should also be empowered to monitor the imported goods.
