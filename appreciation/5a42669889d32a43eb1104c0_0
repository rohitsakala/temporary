 'Labour' is in the Concurrent List.  Two ceilings are 

provided  under  the  Act,  namely,  Eligibility  Limit  which  is  Rs.  10,000  per  month 

and the Calculation Ceiling Rs. 3500.  In this Bill, the eligibility limit is proposed 

to  be  increased  from  Rs.  10,000  per  month  to  Rs.  21,000  per  month.    The 

calculation  ceiling  is  also  be  raised  from  Rs.  3500  to  Rs.  7000  or  the  minimum 

wage for the scheduled employment.  Hon. Prime Minister desired that this benefit 

be  made  effective  from  the  1st  day  of  April,  2014,  for  which  an  official 

amendment  would  be  moved.    I  am  also  thankful  to  the  hon.  Prime  Minister  for 

giving this advance New Year Gift to crores of poor workers of our country.
