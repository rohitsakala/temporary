 This Bill is almost a flawless Bill but there 

are just a few quick doubts which need more clarity.  If the National Mental Health 

Policy  and  the  Mental  Healthcare  Bill  are  implemented  completely,  I  think  it 

would be a complete win-win situation for all of us. So, before we reach a level of 

getting adequate number of psychiatrists, could we take help of our health workers 

or empower the Ashas and train them a little bit till we finish off with this.  The 

concept of counselors and psychotherapists needs more clarity.  Kindly clarify on 

psychotherapists what you expect out of them and how far they can go in treating 

them.  So, I think we need to have very stringent guidelines in this regard because 

these issues are all chemical imbalances.   I think Karnataka is   one of the states 

which  has  come  out  with  the  best  regulations.    I  would  request  you  to  see  if 

alcoholism and drugs could be put into this Bill as a mental illness.  Who will have 

the authority to exempt under Section 65.  The other point is about the budget and 

structure  of  District  Level  Mental  Health  Boards.    These  Boards  need  to  be  far 

more  active.    The  Government  should  consider  to  bring  all  the  drugs  that  are 

required  for  mental  health  in  the  Essential  Drug  List.    The  last  point  is  women-

centric  approach.      Women  do  not  get  help.    The  Bill  should  be  more  gender-

sensitive  so  that  women  can  get  treatment.    Even  in  divorces  and  separation 

women suffer.  So, I would take this opportunity to ask the hon. Minister to kindly 

clarify some of the doubts because it is a very strong Bill.
