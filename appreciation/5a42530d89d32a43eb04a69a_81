  I  rise  to  support  the  demands  for  grants 

under the Ministry of Agriculture for the year 2017-18.  Our hon. Finance Minister 

in his Budget speech has announced a number of schemes which will surely bring 

about  a  revolutionary  change  to  the  Agrarian  Economy  of  our  country.    Budget 

talks about doubling the income of the farmers in the next five years.  This year's 

Budget  may  be  termed  as  the  Budget  for  the  farmers.    The  Government  has 

decided to provide about Rs. 10 lakh crores for agricultural credit.  The Fasal Bima 

Yojana  launched  by  the  Government  will  greatly  help  the  farmers  to  face  the 

challenges  posed  by  natural  calamities. 

  Another  milestone  towards  the 

development  of  agriculture  in  the  country  is  issuance  of  Soil  Health  Cards.  

Government  has  also  set  up  a  Long  Term  Irrigation  Fund  and  a  dedicated  Micro 

Irrigation  Fund  in  NABARD  to  achieve  the  goal,  'per  drop,  more  crop'.    The 

Government has accorded due importance to Dairy farming which is an important 

source  of  additional  income  for  the  farmers.    I  would  like  to  request  the 

Government  to  announce  special  package  for  the  farmers  belonging  to  my  state, 

Assam  who  have  been  adversely  affected  by  flood  last  year.    Many  farmers  lost 

their land and livelihood due to heavy flood and erosion.
