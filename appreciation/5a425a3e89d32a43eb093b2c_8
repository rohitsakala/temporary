  This  Bill  will  go  a  long  way  in 

providing relief to the footwear industry.  Our young men and women will go and 

study  in  this  institute  and  learn  new  techniques.    Diplomas  and  degrees  will  be 

provided and research work in the relevant field will be done by the students.  Our 

country has made rapid strides in various sectors.  The footwear industry caters to

the rich, the middle class as well as ordinary citizens.  Large industry houses in this 

field  are  earning  profits.    Employment  is  also  being  provided  to  youth  by  these 

industries.  However, the rural artisans and leather-workers do manual work.  Their 

talent must be saved and relief provided to them.  I hail from Fazilka area and the 

footwear of  this  region  is  very  famous  in  Punjab.   Embroidery  work  in  leather is 

the  hallmark  of  Fazilka  footwear.   This  must  be  saved.   The  government  ensures 

that  the  makers  of  Fazilka  footwear  get  remunerative  prices  for  their  product,  it 

will  help  the  leather-workers  and  benefit  the  local  footwear  industry.    Ours  is  a 

large  country.    Opening  up  one  institute  of  this  kind  will  not  serve  the  purpose.  

The need of the hour is to set up several such institutes at the district level in states 

so that a large number of students gain out of it.  Well-trained students can set-up 

their our small industries and provide further employment to the needy.
