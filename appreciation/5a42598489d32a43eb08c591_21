  In  ancient  times,  students  from  all  over  the 

world used to come to India for studies.  Today, India is competing with the world.  

We  have  a  number  of  prestigious  institutes.    Though,  we  have  not  been  able  to 

make  progress in the  field of  education at  desired pace.   Indian  students  are  very 

intelligent in all streams.  Indian scientists are bringing laurels to ISRO.  I think if 

they get support from the government, they can bring laurels to the country.  So I 

request the hon. Minister to provide all facilities to the students.  Our students go to 

foreign countries.  If they get opportunities, they will certainly earn name in their 

respective fields and will stay in the country itself.  I would urge the hon. Minister 

to  develop  syllabi  and  evolve  teaching  patterns  of  international  standards  with 

Indian  touch.    Research  is  important  for  any  institute.    So  research  for  faculties 

should  be  compulsory.    Poor  students  especially  those  belonging  to  Scheduled 

Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  fail  to  afford  admissions  due  to  high  fees.    The 

government should develop some mechanism to assist them in paying fees.  There 

should be a complete ban on ragging in educational institutes.
