 The main focus of this Bill is to empower 

the  Central  Government  to  increase  the  authorized  capital  of  NABARD.    The 

Government intends to extend all kinds of support to the agrarian sector, especially 

construction  of  dams  throughout  the  country  for  irrigation  purposes  and 

development of industry throughout the country for providing fertilizers, pesticides 

and seeds.  NABARD is an offspring of Reserve Bank of India and snapping the 

link between these two will lead to a great disadvantage for both, for RBI, losing 

an important supervisory and development institution like NABARD in the entire 

rural  credit  activities  and  for  NABARD,  losing  the  benefit  of  sagacity  and 

guidance from such a premier central banking institution.  I may suggest here that 

the government may consider appointing the Deputy Governor of Reserve Bank of 

India as Chairman of NABARD which was the practice at the time of formation of 

NABARD.    A  seasoned  central  banker  should  be  immediately  appointed  as  the 

MD  of  NABARD,  as  was  done  before.  There  is  a  need  for  strengthening  the 

resources of NABARD to jack up institutional rural credit.  I also suggest that the 

contribution  from  the  Central  Government  and  RBI  for  NABARD  resources  be 

reinforced further.  Similarly, the contribution to National Rural Credit (Long-term 

Operations) Fund and the National Rural Credit (Stabilisation) Fund should also be 

reinforced  further.  Besides, special  care  should be  taken to  review  the long-term 

co-operative credit structure of the country.  There is also a need for establishing 

NABARD  District  Development  Manager  Offices.    On  this,  I  suggest  re-

establishing  and  opening  of  new  District  Development  Manager's  Offices  of 

NABARD in all the districts of the country.
