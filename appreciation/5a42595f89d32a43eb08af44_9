  It  is  said  that  our  country  has  the 

world's fastest growing economy in spite of bad financial condition throughout the 

world.  This growing economy is not generating enough jobs for the unemployed 

youths  of  our  country.    In  the  last  two  to  three  years,  NPA  has  been  increased 

faster than ever before.  There are many laws and Acts to deal with these cases.   In 

spite of all these Acts, there is no way of speedy recovery of bad debts due to some 

loopholes  and  some  inefficiency  of  the  present  system.    There  are  33  DRTs  and 

five DRATs in India.  Most of these tribunals are sick due to lack of experts and 

staffing.  Also, the debt recovery process in our country is very much lengthy and 

complicated. This Bill seeks to amend four Acts and there are some positive steps 

recommended  which  will  help  to  remove  some  loopholes  in  the  law.    The  Bill 

creates a Central Electronic Registry which will create a data base to prevent fraud 

in  loan  cases.    With  regard  to  loan  recovery,  my  suggestion  is  that  this 

responsibility  should  be  given  to  some  other  district  level  officer  other  than  DM.  

As  far  as  presiding  officer  of  the  Tribunal  and  the  Chairman  of  an  Appellate 

Tribunal is concerned, in both these cases the age limit should not exceed 67 years.  

I  would  also  like  to  know  whether  it  is  possible  to  attach  the  Insolvency  and 

Bankruptcy Code with this Amendment Bill.  Lastly, it is true that in this Bill some 

positive steps are there for recover of debt.  But the question still arise that is this 

Bill sufficient to recover such loans?
