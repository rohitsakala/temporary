 The aim of the Finance Minister 

of  a  Welfare  state  is  not  to  accumulate    money  rather  its  objective  is  to  provide 

facilities  to  the  people.  The  present  GST  Bill  will  simplify  the  things,  make  the 

goods cheaper and check pilferage and corruption. The previous Government had 

once  waived  Rupees  70  thousand  crores  of  loans  due  on  the  farmers.  The  worst 

affected by debt burden is the  farmer of Punjab if the figures of per family,  per 

house and per acre of land are taken,  but the loan waived was the lowest in case of 

Punjab.  Thus,  we  have  a  doubt  that  just  as  discrimination  was  done  last  time  in 

case  of  disbursement  of  funds,  the  same  should  not  repeat  while  accumulating 

funds  and  at  the  time  of  disbursement.  I  have  another  doubt.  The  Hon.  Finance 

Minister  has  said  that  the  Union  Government  "may  compensate".  I  want  an 

amendment  in  this  regard  by  making  it  "shall  compensate".  The  period  of  five 

years  fixed  for  compensating  in  case  of  tax  collection  should  be  increased  to  15 

years or at least made 10 years. The states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand 

have  been  included  in  the  special  provision  of  G.S.T  Council.  I  would  request  to 

include Punjab in the same also.
