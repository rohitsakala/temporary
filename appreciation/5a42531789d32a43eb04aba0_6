  It  is  really  a  matter  of  pride  that  our  Defence 

establishments, jawans of our country are not only protecting the life and property 

of 125 crore countrymen but also people of our neighbouring countries.  Our hon. 

Defence Minister has plugged the loopholes in defence department and hence has 

enhanced  the honour  of our  country.    In  the  year  2011, some  officers of  Defence 

Department arbitrarily brought out an illegal , bogus and fake circular to harass the 

people  of  this  country.    In  order  to  protest  against  this  circular,  the  people 

approached  court  and  the  court  took  the  matter  very  seriously  and  cleared  the 

matter  to  a  great  extent.    I  believe  that  whether  it  is  a  Defence  Minister  or  three 

wings of our Army or Defence secretaries are all part of a same system.  But these 

days Navy officers do not follow the circular brought out by Defence Secretary as 

they have brought out their own circular and have withhold the construction work 

in the Mumbai City.  I would like to state here that at least 22 people have booked 

their  flats  in  a  building  being  constructed  in  Mulund,  Ghatkopar  and  LBS  Road.  

These  people  have  made  their  investment  in  this  construction  of  building  but  the 

officers of Navy have brought out a circular due to which the construction has been 

stopped.    I  would  request  the  Defence  Minister  to  take  up  this  matter  seriously 

because the people engaged in building construction work has a major contribution 

in the GDP of our country.  Besides, it provides employment to crores of people. 

The discussion was not concluded.
