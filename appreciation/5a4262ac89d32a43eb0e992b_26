  Inland  waterways  are  the  most  cost-

effective,  environment-friendly  and  also  a  fuel-efficient  mode  of  transport.    I 

would request the hon. Minister to support Andhra Pradesh in operationalisation of 

NW-4  at  the  earliest.    I  would  request  the  Government  to  look  into  the 

development  of  canals  in  Vijayawada  City  also.    If  IWAI  is  to  carry  out  its 

functions efficiently, it is most important to enhance its capacity, both in terms of 

human  resources  and  finances.    The  existing  bridges  over  the  river  should  be 

redesigned.  The Standing Committee Report recommending the creation of a State 

Level Water Management Council with representatives from the State Government 

should be considered for overseeing in the development of national waterways and 

to  resolve the  issues at  State level  only  to  speed up  the process of the  waterways 

development.  A Special Cell may be created with the consent of the Heads of the 

Ministries concerned so that the probable bottlenecks at every state may be cleared 

without any hindrances.  I congratulate the Minister for taking up the development 

of inland waterways in a serious manner.
