  The  Bill  is  a  proposal  to  amend  the  MMDR 

Act,  1957.    Through  the  current  amendment  of  2016,  the  Government  wants  to 

insert  a  clause  that  will  allow  transfer  of  captive  mining  leases  granted  through 

routes  other  than  auction.  This  will  facilitate  banks  and  financial  institutions  to 

liquidate  stressed  assets.  To  my  mind,  this  amendment  is  in  favour  of  inefficient 

mining  enterprises  rather  than  investing  in  technology  solutions  to  enhance 

efficiency.   This  in  effect  means  that  the Central  Government can  make  arbitrary 

new rules on a case to case basis in allocation of mining leases.  In the State where 

the private land-owners have the right and a lot of hurdles are there, there must be 

a  Constitution  Amendment  for  guaranteeing  proper  land  price  as  well  as  for 

protection of customs and traditions so that mineral wealth exploitation continues 

unhindered  by  private  land-owners'  rights.    I  think,  'Make  in  India'  should  also 

include  the  exploration  of  mines  and  minerals  for  self-sufficiency  in  mineral 

requirement  as  well  as  for  export  for  generating  substantial  foreign  exchange.    I 

want the Minister to take note of this and have a proper examination.
