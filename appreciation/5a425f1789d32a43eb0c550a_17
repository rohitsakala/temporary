  All  the  four  Bills  of  the 

GST are game changers.  This will give maximum benefit to honest traders and 

manufacturers.    They  had  to  go  for  separate  registration  for  excise,  sales  tax, 

service tax and inspectors of every department would visit them  which will be 

discontinued now.  The GST Council has also given benefit to the small traders.  

If  the  sale  is  upto  Rs.20  lakh  and  the  receipt  is  generated,  GST  will  not  be 

applicable on that.  This is a very commendable step.  This will bring down tax 

evasion because the whole chain will be linked.  I urge upon the Government to 

solve  the  problems  arising  in  the  wake  of  the  implementation  of  this  new  tax 

regime  at  the  earliest  because  there  are  a  number  of  provisions  in  the  new  tax 

which is beyond the comprehension of any one.  I wish that the honest tax payer 

may  not  face  any  difficulty.    Even  if  a  trader  has  to  file  37  returns,  all  these 

returns will be e-returns.  As such, he will not require much time in filing them.  

However, attention must be paid to the related infrastructure.  Textile industry is 

the  second  most  employment  giving  industry  in  India  as  of  now.    Tax  is 

imposed presently on readymade garment.  Besides, textile fibre or yarn is taxed 

which is just 1-2 per cent.  It is my request that if the present rate of taxation on 

anything comes to 2-3 per cent, that should not be included in the 5 per cent slab 

and be kept in the zero per cent category.  As 90 per cent people purchase cloth, 

so tax calculation should not be done on cloth as per the readymade garment.
