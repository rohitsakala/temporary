   The Government provides help to 

the persons with disabilities in many ways.  The Government has tried to do justice 

to  such  people  in  all  areas.    When  I  arranged  a  camp  in  my  constituency 

Sindhudurg through the Government, 6,500 persons attended the camp in a single 

district.  We got an opportunity to provide different appliances to the people with 

the help of Central Government.  Even bed-ridden handicapped persons were able 

to  move  out  of  their  homes  when  they  were  provided  with  motorised  tri-cycles.  

There  should  be  arrangements  to  issue  disability  certificates  without  harassing 

them.    I  urge  the  Government  to  arrange  medical  camps  for  the  persons  with 

disabilities in every district.
