  Waterways  can  play  a  very  important  role  in 

the  development  of  the  country  because  water  transportation  is  one  of  the  most 

important  alternative  mode  of  transportation  as  far  as  cost  effectiveness, 

consumption of fuel and eco-friendly measures are concerned.  Through this Bill, 

the Government seeks to develop rivers of the country into waterways and there is 

a  proposal  of  developing  approximately  101  rivers  into  waterways.    This  will 

reduce  the  burden  of  traffic  on  railways  and  surface  transportation.    It  will  also 

result in economic growth of the country.  It will reduce the poverty in the country.  

If all those rivers are included for developing waterways whose names have been 

suggested by the hon. Member of Bihar then it would be a welcome step.
