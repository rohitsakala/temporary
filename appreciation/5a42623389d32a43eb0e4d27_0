 I am very happy today because this august House 

is  going  to  discuss  a  historic  and  landmark  Bill.    This  bill  primarily  seeks  total 

prohibition  on 

the  employment  of  any  child  of  14  years 

in  factories, 

establishments,  shops  etc.    We  have  linked  the  Right  to  Education  Act  of  2009 

with this Bill.  We want that every child should study in school.  This is the very 

purpose of the Right to Education Act.  We have given a new definition.  We have 

defined  a  child  having  the  age  between  14  years  to  18  years  as  adolescent.    The 

adolescents  of  16  years  to  18  years  have  also  been  prohibited  to  be  employed  in 

hazardous  process.    Most  importantly,  this  bill  provided  for  punishment  stricter 

than that of earlier Act.  The employer, who violates the provisions of this Act, will 

be highly punished.  It is a deterrent one.  Earlier it was non-cognizable, now it was 

made cognizable offence.  Another important point which I want to make clear is 

that  we  have  made  a  provision  for  the  constitution  of  a  Rehabilitation  fund  for 

child  and  adolescent.    I  also  appeal  to  all  the  hon.  Members  to  extend  their  full 

cooperation and to support this historic and landmark Bill.
