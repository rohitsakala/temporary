  I  thank  the  hon.  Minister  profusely  for 

bringing this important and necessary amendment for the people.  Amend is being 

affected after 29 years in this regard.  Every product carries a plastic sticker of ISI 

mark.  How can it be determined whether ISI product is genuine or not?  Who will 

ensure  this?    Even  milk  pouches  carry  ISI  mark  yet  we  find  they  are  adulterated 

and  no  one  is  afraid  to  do  this.    It  is  good  that  the  license  raj  has  gone.    But  the 

system we are going to put into place should be adequate.  If it is not adequate we 

will not get the desired result.  As per the provisions of the Bill, certification  has 

been  made  compulsory.    Only  after  that  can  it  be  marketed.    There  should  be  a 

team  to  check  such  products.    Surprise  visits  should  be  carried  out  in  the  market 

especially regarding food products. First thing is that there should be a control on 

manufacturing and production.  What should we do for controlling the production.  

Organic production is being talked about.  The entire state of Sikkim is engaged in 

organic cultivation which is a very welcome step.  I would like to know as to what 

the  Government  proposed  to  do  for  organic  products.    I  feel  it  is  not  possible  to 

achieve all at one go but I am sure that the Government will certainly pay attention 

towards these points.
