  The  misguided  system  has  been  put  back 

on the track during the last two years.  The constitution  of NITI Aayog in the place 

of  the  Planning  Commission  is  a  step  towards  this  very  direction.    The  work  has 

become  easier  and  the  time  taken  in  leading  this  to  the  ground  level  has  also  been 

reduced.   It is a big assurance to provide pucca houses to all by the year 2022.  The 

implementation  of  the  policies  of  government  of  India  and  the  result  thereof  are 

bound  to  be  better  if  the  state  governments  work  in  close  coordination  with  the 

Government  of  India.      In  1971  a  slogan  was  raised  regarding  the  elimination  of 

poverty but the same has not yet been eliminated but our government delivers on the 

promises which it  makes.
