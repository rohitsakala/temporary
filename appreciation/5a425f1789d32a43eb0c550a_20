    The GST, being a consumption-based 

tax,  states  with  higher  consumption  of  goods  and  services  will  have  better 

revenues. So, the co-operation from State Governments would be one of the key 

factors  for  the  successful  implementation  of  GST.  One  of  the  most  significant 

challenges  for  successful  implementation  of  GST  is  to  have  good  IT 

infrastructure  in  the  country.  So,  the  Government  needs  to  work  on  that 

problem. There is no special provision for North-Eastern States, in spite of the 

fact  that  the  Constitution  (One  Hundred  and  First  Amendment)  Act  empowers 

GST Council to make special provision for North-Eastern States. There should 

have been a  mechanism  of  seamless  flow of  credit of  all the  taxes paid in  any 

State. It was expected that the Government will take measures to educate trade 

and  industries not  only  in  towns  and  cities  but  even in  far  flung  areas  of  rural 

India.  This  has  not  been  done.  Any  person  doing  inter-state  sales  will  not  be 

entitled  for  composition  scheme.  In  the  North-Eastern  States  a  lot  of  trade 

happen inter-state and they will be deprived of opting for composition scheme, 

thereby a lot of hardship will faced by them. They will not be able to compete 

with  dealers  around  the  country.  Anti-profiteering  clause  will  be  used  for 

harassment  of  trade  and  industries.  There  is  no  mechanism  to  prevent  any 

harassment. 

  There  are  many  objections  from  trade  associations.  The 

Government needs to redress their concerns and problems. I would request the 

hon. Minister to remove the anomalies in the present. Bill and adopt a simplified 

and more beneficial law.
