  These are important amendments by 

the Upper House of which the Finance Minister, who is moving the Bill, himself is 

a  very  respected  and  senior  Member.      So,  I  am  sure  he  respects  the  House  to 

which he belongs.  All these amendments including the deletion of Clause 15 seem 

very reasonable which our party the Biju Janta Dal has been trying to implement in 

the  Aadhaar  process.  If  any  of  our  Members  are  enrolled  in  Aadhaar  here,  I  can 

get their details by Rs. 50 per person.  That is already available and this is there in 

the market.  This  is a democracy and this is a country that loves freedom.  I guess 

all  of  us  here  are  direct  beneficiaries  of  that  process  of  democracy.    Therefore,  I 

would suggest like earlier the Hon. Member did that let there be no hurry.
