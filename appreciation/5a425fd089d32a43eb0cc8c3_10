  I  also  wholeheartedly 

appreciate  him  for  bringing  out  a  wonderful  legislation.    It  really  protects  the 

consumers  and  brings  in  the  standardization.    The  Bill  is  silent  if  the  promoter 

takes advance without registration and needs to be addressed.  The conditions of 12 

apartments and above 500 square meter should be deleted.  It requires balancing of 

the  promoters  as  well  as  the  interest  of  the  buyers.    We  suggest  that  more 

concessions may be given to affordable housing, like the tax holiday, less interest, 

etc. so that the middle class and the poor will also get benefited.  Whether housing 

should  also  be  given  an  infrastructure  status  is  a  long-pending  issue.    The  Bill  is 

also  silent  on  the  required  defaulters.    We  need  to  define  the  carpet  area.    One 

important point is those who are working either in the Regulatory Authority or in 

the  Appellate,  either  as  the  Heads  or  as  Members,  they  should  not  be  allowed  to 

reemploy  in  the  private  sector.    As  regards  50  per  cent  amount  more  than  the 

deposits,  monitoring  of  withdrawals  is  required.    Lastly,  the  black  money  is  the 

fountain head but it is really silent on that.
