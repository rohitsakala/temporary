 The inland water transport is 

fuel efficient, cost effective and environment friendly mode of transport, especially 

for  bulk  goods,  hazardous  goods  and  over  dimensional  cargos.    It  also  reduces 

time,  cost  of  transportation  of  goods  and  cargos,  as  well  as  congestion  and 

accidents  on  highways.    The  inland  waterways  mode  of  transportation  has 

immense potential for domestic cargo transportation as well as for cruise, tourism 

and  passenger  traffic.    Its  systematic  development  will  open  up  progressive 

economic  and  transport  opportunities  in  the  country.    This  inland  waterways 

project  will  ease  out  the  transportation  problems  in  Chennai  suburbs  to  a  great 

extent  besides  promoting  tourist  movement  to  important  tourist  spots  between 

Mahabalipuram  and  Puducherry.    The  development  of  South  Buckingham  Canal 

can  also  improve  the  drainage  system  during  flood  season  in  Chennai  city.    For 

loading and uploading of goods, terminals will be established at Pulicat lake, Basin 

Bridge,  Palavakkam,  Alamparai,  Kazhanchi  and  Cuddalore.    The  Buckingham 

Canal,  opened  in  1806,  was  once  one  of  the  longest  canals  in  India.    The 

Buckingham  Canal  was  a  major  channel  for  trade  and  industry  between  Tamil 

Nadu and Andhra.  I urge upon the Government to support the implementation of 

the  interlinking  of  peninsular  rivers  and  interlinking  of  all  the  rivers  within  the 

State as requested by our hon. Chief Minister.
