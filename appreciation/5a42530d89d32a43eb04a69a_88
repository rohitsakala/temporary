 Farmers' welfare only can lead 

to welfare of the nation.  The Government is committed to writing a new chapter of 

poverty  alleviation,  socio-economic  change  and  employment  generation  through 

comprehensive  reforms  in  agriculture  sectors.    An  allocation  of  Rs.10  lakh  crore 

has been made for agriculture credit.  Special efforts are made to provide soft loans 

to farmers.  Budget for agriculture has been increased by 24 per cent for the year 

2017-18.  Agriculture growth is expected to be 4 per cent.  An initiative is taken to 

bring  legislation  on  contract  farming.    Irrigation  is  being  accorded  top  priority  in 

the  country  and  more  and  more  farmers  are  being  covered  under  Fasal  Bima 

Yojana.    An  allocation  of  Rs.8,000  crore  has  been  made  for  dairy  development 

through  NABARD.    Soil  testing  laboratories  are  being  set  up  and  allocation  in 

agriculture  education  has been  increased by  40  times.   Neem  coating  of urea  will 

stop its black-marketing.  I request the hon. Minister of Agriculture to formulate a 

special  agriculture  policy  for  the  entire  Himalyan  region  in  consonance  with 

regional  needs.    Production  of  medicinal  herbs,  horticulture,  floriculture  and 

organic farming should be promoted there.  Abandoned tea gardens in Uttarakhand 

should be revived and farmers of Himalyan region should be linked with marketing 

centers.
