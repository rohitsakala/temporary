 The child labour, in fact, is an international problem 

and our country is also no exception to this problem.  Spread of education can play 

a positive role in eliminating poverty from our country.  Therefore, we cannot put 

an end to this problem by merely legislating laws.  There are several aspects to this 

problem which need to be pondered over like human trafficking is taking place on 

a very large scale.  Today, the Railways has started an initiative called Child Line 

to  check  trafficking  of  children  through  trains.    Similarly,  we  can  also  take  such 

measures  to  make  it  difficult  child  trafficking  through  road  network.    Today,  the 

condition of our schools is not very good.  If at all we send these children to these 

schools,  they  cannot  shape  their  future  properly.    So,  there  are  many  problems 

which need a holistic view to find a solution to this problem and only then we can  

protect  the  future  of  these  poor  children.    These  children  are  our  future  assets  as 

they  are  capable  of  giving  new  direction  to  our  nation.    The  Government  has 

launched several schemes like the Jan Dhan Yojana, Mudra Banking etc to remove 

poverty  in  our  country.     Finally, we  hope  that this law, as amended,  would  go  a 

long way in prohibiting child labour in our country.
