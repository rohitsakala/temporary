 I rise to support the Bill.  In fact, this Bill 

ought to have been brought much earlier, owing to the mounting bad loans of the 

banks.  It is the need of the hour to introduce a number of changes in existing laws 

to  speed  up  the  bad  loan  recovery  process.  As  part  of  the  overhaul  of  the  Debt 

Recovery  Tribunals, the  Bill  proposes  to  speed  up  the  process  of  recovery.    This 

will  save  time  and  energy  of  the  banks.    The  Bill  allows  banks  to  file  cases  in 

tribunals  having  jurisdiction  over  the  area  of  the  bank  branch  where  the  debt  is 

pending.    The  Bill  proposes  to  widen  the  scope  of  the  central  registry  that  will 

house  the  central  data  base  of  all  loans  against  properties  given  by  all  lenders.   I 

welcome this Bill.
