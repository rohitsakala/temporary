  Inland  water  transport  is  the  most  economical 

mode  of  transportation.    Currently,  we  have  only  five  inland  waterways.    If  this 

Bill is passed, then 106 more inland waterways will be included.  The proposal has 

a  lot  of  benefits  in  view  of  controlling  pollution,  development  of  tourism, 

economic growth, etc.  I have some concerns in this regard.  Most of these rivers 

are rainfed rivers, which may not carry enough water during the time of summer.  

The question is: Can we dredge those rivers in a routine manner?  So, we should 

have  a  techno-economic  feasibility  study  before  going  through  such  a  dream 

project.  The proposed inland waterways will be under the Central Government but 

the water  itself is a State subject.  So, will there be no conflict between the centre 

and the states?  There is a plan on the part of the Government to interlink rivers all 

over the country.  If we implement the river linking plan.  We may not be able to 

maintain the balance in view of flow of water in all the rivers.  National Waterway 

No. 5 in the States of West Bengal and Odisha should be developed appropriately.
