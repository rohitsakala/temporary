  The  Delhi  High  Court  today  is  in  a 

situation  that  it  is  practically  looking  at  every  original  civil  proceeding.    By 

increasing  pecuniary  will  decline  by  ten-folds,  we  are  actually  going  to  transfer 

more  than  12,000  cases  which  are  pending  in  the  Delhi  High  Court  to  the  lower 

courts.    It  is  not  only  in  the  interest  of  the  public,  but  also  in  the  interest  of  the 

judiciary.    Also,  there  will  be  lesser  burden  on  account  of  the  court  fee  on  the 

parties to dispute.  I also wish to point out that this Bill is relevant because there is 

a  need  to  bring  uniformity  in  the  pecuniary  jurisdiction  of  all  the  High  Courts 

across the country.  Similarly, we have to equate the District Courts in Delhi with 

the other District Courts in the adjoining areas.
