  It  is  a  good  thing  that  the 

students who will get education from this institute would be awarded degrees and 

diplomas.  India is the third biggest market of footwear in the world.  I demand that 

a  branch  of  this  institute  should  also  be  opened  in  Bihar  and  avenues  of 

employment  should  also  be  created  through  this  institute.    The  students  who  get 

education  and  training  from  this  institute  should  also  be  given  bank  loans  and 

quality education should also be provided to them.
