  The  concept of one  country 

one  tax  of  the  GST  is  being  commended  by  the  economists  of  not  only  this 

country  but  those  across  the  world.    I  think  that  this  will  take  the  economy  of 

our  country  ahead.    In  my  opinion  the  maximum  benefit  through  this  system 

will be this that the tax leakage will be removed and the difficulty to the trader 

moving across the states will end.  This will increase revenue which will boost 

the  economy  naturally.    This  is  the  biggest  decision  of  the  government  with 

regard  to  tax  reform.    The  government  will  have  to  ensure  that  the  tax  payer 

does not face any difficulty.  No tax payer should feel any burden while paying 

tax.    The  Government  has  made  slabs  of  5,12,18,28,40  per  cents, however,  an 

additional cess of 15 per cent is also likely.  It has not been decided on which 

items this cess would be imposed, who will impose this cess and how will it be 

imposed.    We  want  that  the  cooperative  societies  should  be  exempted  from  it, 

otherwise the common poor people of Punjab and other several states will have 

much loss due to it.  There is a talk across the country that tax will be levied on 

ancillary professions of agriculture such as poultry, dairy, fishery etc.  No one 

can  carry  on  agricultural  activity  without  these  ancillary  professions.    The 

farmer  ekes  out  a living  through  one  ancillary  activity  or  the other.     If  that is 

taxed,  he  will  have  much  loss.    I  want  a  clarification  in  this  regard  by  the 

Government.  At least the income from land should be exempted.  I feel that it 

will be a dangerous thing if tax is imposed on leased property.  GST should be 

implemented on petroleum products.  I appreciate this Bill.
