  The Factories Act of 1948 is a comprehensive Act.  

The  Central  legislation  is  for  safety,  health  and  welfare  of  labourers  as  also 

working  hours  and  regulations  of  their  working  condition.    The  Factories 

(Amendment) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha in 2014 including Sections 64 and 

65 for the enhancement of working hours.  Subsequently, this Bill was referred to 

the Parliamentary Standing Committee, which has also submitted its Report.  Now, 

a  comprehensive  Amendment  Bill  on  Factories  Act  1948  is  under  consideration.  

The  proposed  amendments  are  with  respect  to  Section  64  which  indicates 

enhancement of overtime from 50 hours to 100 hours in a quarter and Section 65 

which indicates enhancement of overtime from 75 hours to 125 hours in a quarter.  

I  am  mentioning  this  enhancement  of  hours  because  145  hours  in  a  quarter  is 

described in ILO.  That is why, I am proposing less than what the ILO has ratified.  

Moreover, in Sections 64 and 65 - to make rules and orders, the rights and powers 

of the State Governments are not being taken away anywhere.  It will also ensure 

uniformity and its application in the entire State Governments and in UTs.  That is 

why, I would like to request this august House to consider and pass this Bill, which 

will give a boost the manufacturing sector.
