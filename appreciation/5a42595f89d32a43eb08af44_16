 This Bill is certainly going to be very effective.  It 

can easily be understood the loss to our economy when Rs. 5 lakh crores or 8 lakh 

crores  are  involved.   Earlier  the provision  was  that  a  case in  a  tribunal should be 

disposed  off  within  180  days.    However,  the  legal  process  is  so  complicated  no 

matter  how  much  laws  are  framed  the  complication  continues.    Total  number  of 

pending  cases  are  now  70  thousand  involving  Rs.  8  or  9  lakh  crores,  adversely 

effecting  our  economy.    Hence,  the  need  to  seek  a  solution  to  this  problem 

seriously.    Bank  is not  an  ordinary  institution  alone.   It  is  repository  of  our  trust.   

We have trust on the banks that it is a separate institution and will adopt a feasible 

approach.  We should put in place a system in the Banks instead of entering into 

litigations.    The  senior  officers  of  the  banks  should  try  to  find  a  solution  after 

listening  to  both  the  sides.    This  will  resolve  the  problem  to  a  large  extent.    We 

know that the entire banking system had crashed in the US.  We should therefore, 

try  to  improve  the  system.    One  individual  was  successful  in  stealing  and  taking 

away  9000  crores  of  rupees  out  of  the  country.    Therefore,  there  is  something 

wrong in the system.  This Bill is a welcome step as it  will simplified the system 

and made it practical.  It will also contain such individuals who wanted to steal and 

run away from the country.
