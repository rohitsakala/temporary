  The  condition  of  small  banks  has 

deteriorated  due  to  the  NPAs.    In  the  process  to  bring  about  improvement,  five 

subsidiary  banks  of  the  State  Bank  i.e.  State  Bank  of  Hyderabad,  State  Bank  of 

Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of 

Travancore have  been  merged into the  State  Bank of  India.   It  is  my  request that 

the Government may endeavour to set up the branches of the State Bank in those 

rural  areas  where  its  branches  are  not  available.    With  regard  to  the  charges 

imposed by the SBI, I would request the Government that it should be waived for 

the  common  man.    I  believe  that  if  the  smaller  banks  are  merged,  NPAs  will 

certainly  be  reduced  and  we  will  get  success  in  recovering      the  money  from  the 

big industrialists who are loan defaulters and who have fled the country.
