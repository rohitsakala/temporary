June,  2010  is  being  amended  by  the  Central  Government  to  include  Jammu  and 

Kashmir  within  its  ambit  especially  for  collection  of  statistics.    The  all  India 

mechanism  of  data  collection  which  in  place  will  strengthen  following  this 

amendment.    The  Government  has  designated  nodal  officers  for  effective 

implementation  of  this  Bill  and  these  nodal  officers  have  been  delegated  powers 

besides fixing responsibility on them as well.  There was a legislative vacuum in 

respect  of  statistical  matters  in  the  Union  List  or  Concurrent  List  applicable  to 

Jammu  and  Kashmir  but  following  this  amendment  this  vacuum  would  be  filled

Kashmir.    Besides,  there  will  be  uniformity  in  data  and  they  will  also  be  more 

reliable.    The  statistics  which  are  collected  on  economics,  demographic,  social, 

scientific  and  environmental  by  various  departments  of  the  Center  and  the  State 

Governments  would  be  more  systematic  and  the  Government  could  use  these 

statistics  effectively  for  better  implementation  of  its  welfare  schemes.    With  the 

appointment of nodal officers, there would be better coordination and supervision 

among all departments and duplication of statistics also would be avoided.
