 This Institute of Petroleum and 

Energy  is  a  part  of  our  Government's  promise  and  commitment  to  the  Andhra 

Pradesh when it was bifurcated.  This Institute will fill the gap of qualitative and 

quantitative  need  for  oil  sector  by  promoting  research  and  development  work  in 

both  petroleum  and  petroleum  related  energy  sector.    I  would  urge  the  hon. 

Minister  to  restart  the  Shivasagar  Petroleum  Institute  in  Assam.    I  hope  he  will 

establish  such  type  of  institutes  all  over  the  country,  especially  in  the  North-

Eastern region because there is dearth of talented and skilled people.
