    I  thank 

all  the  hon.  Members  for  participating  in  this  discussion.    I  want  to  inform  this 

August House that the proposal to increase over time period by amending Sections 

64  and  65  is  not  at  all  mandatory,  it  is  upto  the  worker  to  decide.    There  is  no 

compulsion on him or her but it is an incentive to get the double wages.   Another 

very important thing which I want to clarify to all the hon. Members is that we are 

not  curtailing  any  powers  of  the  State  Governments.    I  already  informed  in  the 

beginning  that  this  is  meant  for  facilitating  increase  in  employment  generation  in 

the  manufacturing  sector.      I  have  taken  many  safeguards  about  the  overtime.  

When  the  comprehensive  amendment  comes,  safety,  working  conditions,  and  all 

aspects will be taken up. There is no compromise on the working conditions or any 

welfare  measures.    All  the  issues  will  be  addressed  in  the  comprehensive 

amendment.  About the urgency, I would like to mention that this is the need of the 

hour  because  we  have  taken  up  flagship  programmes  in  which  investments  are 

coming  and  a  large  workforce  is  needed.    About  the  role  of  the  Central 

Government under this Act, I would like to tell that the federal structure is not at 

all damaged.    Powers of the State Governments will not be curtailed.  Worker's 

health  and  other  things  will  be  taken  care  of.    In  consultation  with  the  State 

Government, the  Central  Government  will  frame  all  the  required  rules.   This  Bill 

pertains only to two sections.  Shortly we will be coming up with a comprehensive 

Bill before the Parliament which will answer every query of the hon. Members. 

The Bill was passed.
