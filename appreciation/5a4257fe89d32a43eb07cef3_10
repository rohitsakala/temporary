 If commercial disputes are resolved within 6 months 

then it would create trust among the investors.  This is a well considered Bill in the 

interest of the country.  Crores of cases are pending in the lower courts.  The delay 

in justice is also a reason for increasing crime.  Unless all the vacancies of Judges 

are filled up in the regular courts, this problem cannot be solved.
