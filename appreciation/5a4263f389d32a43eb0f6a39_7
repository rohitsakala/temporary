  There is no cap on liability.  The entire amount 

is paid by the insurance company.  There is no gap.  A competent judicial authority 

can give the decision.  It can benefit them.  So, no question arises.  As far as fees 

are  concerned,  the  States  are  competent  to  reduce  it.    They  can  do  it.    The 

Government will take into account all the suggestions given by the members.  With 

these words, the House is requested to pass the Bill unanimously. 

The Bill, as amended, was passed.
