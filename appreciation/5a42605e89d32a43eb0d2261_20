  I  would  like  to  thank  the 

hon. Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modiji, as well as the HRD Minister 

for choosing Goa as one of the States for setting up of an IIT, one of the premier 

institutions of our country.  It was announced recently that an NIT would also be 

instituted at a village called Kunkoli.  Besides the NIT, with the IIT which would 

be set up, Goa would definitely emerge as an education hub in India.  Technology 

is evolving.  We are moving towards nano technology and our younger generation 

would like to be trained in various fields of technology.  I am quite confident that 

under the leadership of our Prime Minster Shri Narendra Modi as well as under the 

leadership  of  the  HRD  Minister  Shri  Prakash  Javadekar,  India  would  emerge  as 

one of the educational hubs in the world.
