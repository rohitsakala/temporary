    The  River  Yamuma  passes 

through  Delhi,  Virndavan,  Mathura,  Agra,  Batesar,  Itawa,  Kalpi,  Hamirpur, 

Allahabad  to  Kolkata.    The  expenditure  of  people  of  my  constituency  coming  to 

Delhi via road will reduce if waterway is constructed on this river.  Sand mining is 

carried  out  in  Yamuna  from  Itawa  to  Hamirpur.    Due  to  construction  of  this 

waterway,  environmental  degradation  will  be  checked  and  that  area  will  be 

benefitted.      Around  150  years  ago,  Kalpi  was  a  bustling  trade  center.    If  Kalpi 

Nagar  is  made  a  waterway  station  on  this  route,  the  people  of  this  area  will  be 

benefited.
