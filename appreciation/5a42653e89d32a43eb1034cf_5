  I  place  on  record  my  sincere  thanks  to  the 

hon.  Finance  Minister  for  bringing  forward  such  a  Bill  which  may  remove  the 

existing  complicated  tax  structure  and  pave  the  way  to  legislate  the  uniform  tax 

structure around the country.  GST  will replace all indirect taxes levied on goods 

and services by the Indian Central and State Governments.  The above Amendment 

Bill seeks to omit Entry  52 of the State List of the Constitution of India.  Entry 52 

empowers the Municipal Corporation is levy taxes on the entry of goods into local 

area for consumption, use or sale therein.  Due to omission, the powers vested with 

the  Municipal  Corporation  to  levy  such  taxes  would  be  eliminated;  thereby  the 

present  source of  revenue  by  way  of  octroi  would not  be  available  which    would 

have  adverse  impact  on  the  Municipal  Corporation's  revenue  income.    Due  to 

omission  of  Entry  52  of  the  Constitution  of  India,  the  financial  autonomy  of  the 

urban local bodies will be jeopardized.  Mayor of the Metro City shall be made in 

Member of the GST Council.  In Clause 19, the word 'may' be substituted by the 

world  'shall'  and  after  the  word  'States',  the  world  'Urban  Local  Bodies'  shall  be 

inserted, and in place of the world 'five, the word 'ten' shall be substituted.
