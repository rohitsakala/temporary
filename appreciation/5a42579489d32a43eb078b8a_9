  The proposed Taxation Bill 

is  dealing  with  three  comparatively  small,  technical  but  important  aspects  of 

taxation and tariff laws. As the Finance Minister has stated in his opening remarks, 

this proposed amendment has been done keeping in mind the larger public interest 

and  put  in  use  the  land  which  has  been  lying  idle  for  more  than  a  decade.  The 

second  amendment  is  to  Section  80JJAA  of  the  Income  Tax  Act.  The  apparel 

manufacturing  industry  provides  employment  and  is  capable  of  providing  more 

employment  opportunities.  Our  Government  has  recently  approved  a  special 

package of around Rs. 6000 crore for the textile and apparel sector, to create more 

than  one  crore  jobs,  attract  investments  and  also  to  generate  exports.  The  third 

amendment  to  the  First  Schedule  to  the  Customs  Tariff  Act  would  enable  the 

Government  to  fix  the  appropriate  and  effective  rate  of  the  Customs  Duty  on 

marbles and granites  â€“ from 10 per cent to WTO-bound rate of 40 per cent. This 

has  also  been  done  with  an  intention  to  boost  the  domestic  industry.  Our 

Government  is  moving  in  the  direction  of  creating  a  vibrant  and  sustainable 

economy,  which  would  create  jobs  and  also  help  manufacturing  sector  in  the 

country.
