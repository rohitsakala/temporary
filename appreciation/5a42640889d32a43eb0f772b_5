  I  rise  to  support  this  Bill  whole-

heartedly.  I think, it is a perfect tribute through this Parliament, to great men like 

Phuleji.    The  National  Commission  for  Backward  Classes  was  constituted  in 

August, 1993 yet it did not have Constitutional status.  It did not have to involve 

any  financial  implications.    But  if  there  is  a  grievance,  non-implementation,  etc. 

one  has  to  go  to  the  national  Commission  for  Scheduled  Castes.    Only  125 

complaints  were  entertained.    It  is  because  the  SC  had  already  got  a  lot  of 

complaint  with  the  NCSC.    Due  to  provision  of  'creamy  layer',  only  11  per  cent 

OBCs  are  able  to  take  the  benefit of this reservation.   Therefore, I  urge  upon the 

hon.  Minister  to  delete  the  word  'creamy  layer'  till  27  per  cent  OBCs  take  the 

benefit of this reservation.  I urge the Government to constitute the OBC Ministry, 

bring out socio-economic caste census and increase the budget. I would also like to 

request the Government to establish the Phule Institute or the Phule Foundation on 

a par with the Ambedkar Foundation; declare holiday on Phule Jayanti; and give all 

the tributes to this great man who was an inspiration to Dr. Ambedkar himself.
