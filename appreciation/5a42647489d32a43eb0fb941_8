  Several  honourable  Members 

have expressed their views on the Sikh Gurudwara (Amendment) Bill.  I consider 

all  of  them  important.    The  followers  of  Sikhism  have  made  the  greatest 

contribution  in  protecting  Indian  culture.    The  government  had  received  a 

complaint  alleging  that  non-sikhs  were  enrolled  as  voters  for  SGPC  elections.  

SGPC  in  its  general  assembly  in  the  year  2011  passed  a  resolution  disallowing 

Sahajdharis from voting and allowing only Keshdharis which was endorsed by the 

Punjab  Government  of  the  day.    Some  hon.  Members  have  also  raised  an  issue 

relating to the number of sehajdhari sikhs and keshdhari sikhs.  When in the year 

2004, preparations were being made for holding the election of SGPC, the number 

of  keshdhari  sikhs  was  more  than  54lakhs  and  that  of  sehajdhari  sikhs  was  7.96 

lakh.    Therefore,  out  of  total  sikh  population,  the  percentage  of  sehajdhari  sikhs 

was 12.8.  But, in the elections of 2004 and 2011  sehajdhari sikhs could not cast 

their  votes.    The  High  Court  of  Punjab  and  Haryana  had  already  stated  that  the 

competent legislature could take a suitable decision in this matter.  Therefore, the 

Government has to bring this amendment Bill.  Rajya Sabha has already passed it 

unanimously.  I hope that this House will also pass this bill unanimously because 

the followers of a religion have got the right to take a decision as to how they want 

to run the internal system of their religion.   

The Bill was passed.
