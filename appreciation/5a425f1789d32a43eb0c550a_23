    This  is  the  most  important  indirect 

tax reform in India's history.  After the passage of this Bill, it will subsume 17 

types of taxes levied by the Central and the State Governments and there will be 

a  uniform  Goods  and  Services  Tax  in    the  entire  country.    The  cost  of  the 

products  will  be  reduced  after  its  implementation.    This  will  also  be  an 

important step to promote Make-in- India.  Due to the increase in manufacturing 

sector, more FDI will inflow in the country and it will economically strengthen 

the country.
