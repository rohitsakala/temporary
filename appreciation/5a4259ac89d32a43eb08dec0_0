  This  Bill  extends  to  the  whole  of  India 

including  Jammu  and  Kashmir.    The  people  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  will  be 

benefitted to a great extent from this Bill.  This Bill has been brought to simplify 

the  collection  of  statistics.    Through  this  Amendment  Bill  for  collection  of  data, 

accurate  data  could  be  made  available.    It  will  bring  about  development  in  the 

country.  Through this Bill, it could be ascertained that  individuals of which class 

reside at which location and who are rich and poor among them and what are the 

needs of which community.  As a result thereof, there will be support of statistics 

while making schemes after planning for their betterment in future.  With accurate 

statistics, schemes could be formulated and implemented in a better manner. Direct 

benefit of  central  schemes  should  accrue particularly  to  the poor.   Earlier, people 

used  to  face  various  sorts  of  problems  due  to  non-availability  of  accurate  data.  

Now,  all  the  people  will  get  the  benefits  of  schemes.    The  people  of  Jammu  and 

Kashmir will also get the benefit of these schemes now.  The people of Jammu and 

Kashmir  have  not  been  able  to  become  self-reliant  as  yet  from  the  viewpoint  of 

economic and social development.  I would like to submit that through this Bill the 

people  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  will  get  connected  with  the  country  and  they  will 

get  full  benefit  through  this  Bill  because  the  centre  will  get  accurate  statistics 

directly.    A  nodal  officer  has  been  appointed.    The  common  man  will  also  get 

major benefit as a result thereof.  I support this Bill and welcome it.
