information  technology  hubs.    So,  we  need  such  hubs  in  Punjab.    There  are  certain 

shortcomings  in  IIT.    These  shortcomings  must  be  removed  by  the  Central 

Government.  Students who study in these institutes of higher learning, often join the 

jobs in foreign multi-national companies abroad.  It leads to acute brain-drain.  I urge 

upon  the  government  to  evolve  such  a  system  where  it  is  made  compulsory  for 

students to work in one's own country and State for the first 5 to 10 years.  The states 

and  our  country  will  gain  out  of  it.    Students  belonging  to  the  Scheduled  Castes  & 

Scheduled Tribes are generally not in a condition to shell out one to one and half lakh 

rupees as fees.  Scholarships and fee-exemptions should be granted to the SC & ST 

students too, so that they can study in IITs etc.  The scholarship system needs to be

revamped  in  the  Engineering  Colleges.    Scholarship  system  must  be  streamlined  in 

all states, especially Punjab.
