 If black money and benami property 

is  not  wiped  out,  honest  and  middle  class  person  cannot  indulge  into  election 

politics. That is why I congratulate the Government. Political parties do not want to 

touch these things. The Congress Party might have brought this Act originally, but 

it did not utilize it. This is the biggest example of political will. Such a law is the 

yardstick  of  change  that  is  brought  about  through  a  change  in  government.  Such 

decisions  shake  up  governments  as  the  persons  having  property  are  not  ordinary 

persons.    ‘Aadhaar  Numbers’  should  be  linked  with  registry  so  that  if  I  have  ten 

properties, this number will reflect all my ten properties and the remaining benami 

properties will be exposed one day or the other. I feel that three things are a must 

in this regard, such as linking of Aadhaar Number with registry will be an effective 

way to reveal the benami property. The second measure is to make it mandatory to 

declare properties while filing Income Tax. There is no mention in this Bill about 

the properties of the Mutt and the temples. Will the trust operating for thousands of 

years in which the name of any person has not been mentioned, get protection? I 

feel  that  it  should  be  kept  into  view.  I  support  this  Bill  congratulating  the 

Government.  It  will  be  a  history  before  the  coming  generation  that  the  thing 

initiated in the year 1882 has finally been settled in the year 2016.
