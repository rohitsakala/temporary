  This  Bill  will  pave  the  way  for  meeting  the 

energy mismatch in the country which is very crucial for inclusive growth and also 

helps in taking the country forward.  Nuclear power has been the exclusive domain 

and monopoly of NPCIL since independence but this Bill paves the way for other 

PSUs  to  invest  in  nuclear  energy  production  in  the  country.    Secrecy  on  nuclear 

activities in the country should go now and private companies should also allow in 

this sector like other countries.  Renewable energy like sun and wind cannot be the 

total solution for clean energy in this world because the world needs energy even 

when the sun does not shine and even when the wind does not blow.    The  private 

sector in the country is interested to enter into this new and challenging sector.  It 

can  be  permitted  with  appropriate  regulatory  framework.    I  would  request  the 

Government of India to revisit this whole approach and take a positive view on this 

and  to look  at  20 per  cent of  total  power coming  from  nuclear  power  as  a target.  

Uranium  is  the  primary  source  for  nuclear  power.    We  have  entered  into 

agreements with Canada, Kazakhstan and Australia.  So, I want to know what the 

Government  is  doing  to  get  uranium  from  these  countries.    Andhra  Pradesh  is 

having the highest amount of uranium deposits.  So, I would like to know from the 

hon.  Minister  what  Atomic  Minerals  Directorate  for  Exploration  is  doing  to 

explore uranium and how the Government is trying to allay the apprehensions the 

local  people  about  the  health  hazards  that  are  attached  to  uranium  exploration.  

Finally, I would like to know about the progress that is being made in setting up of 

Kovvada  3,000  megawatt  nuclear  power  plant  in  Srikakulam,  Andhra  Pradesh.   

Please explain whether the Ministry is going to set up the plant or not or it is going 

to be shelved.
