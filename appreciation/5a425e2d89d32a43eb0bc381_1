    The  hon.  Minister  of  Law  and 

Justice  has  introduced      the  Repealing  and  Amending  (Fourth)  Bill,  2015  in  this 

House.    This  is  a  good  and  long  awaited  initiative.    There  are  a  number  of  laws 

enacted during British rule which have no utility today and they must be definitely 

repealed.  This  initiative  was    taken  in  1998.      The  hon.  Prime  Minister  had 

mentioned in his party's manifesto and in his election rallies that we will repeal the 

obsolete  laws  which  are  of  no  use  now.    This  Bill  has  two  aspects    one  is 

amendment  and  other  is  repealing.    There  is  a  provision  of  repealing  295  Acts.  

One and half decade ago the Law Commission has recommended repealing of 250 

laws which has not been done till date. In the year 1998 the P.C. Jain Committee 

had recommended to repeal 250 irrelevant laws but that was also not implemented.  

There  are 83  central laws  which  relate  to the  states  and  are  to be  repealed by  the 

State  Legislatures.    There  are  257  Appropriation  Acts  in  the  Union  territories 

which  are  to  be  repealed  by  the  Union  Government.    In  this  Bill  there  is  an 

amendment pertaining to harassment of women at the work place.  I request all the 

political parties and leaders to support this Bill.
