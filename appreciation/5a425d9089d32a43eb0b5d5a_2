  The  Second  National 

Labour  Commission  had  given  its  Report  in  2002  stating  that  all  the  labour  laws 

should  be  tuned  to  the  present-day  time.    That  was  in  2002  and  now  we  are  in 

2017.  This is related to only four Acts.  These four Acts will be amalgamated into 

one Labour Code.  It is being done only for simplification, rationalisation and also 

doing away with the cumbersome process.  I assure this House that no where the 

rights  of  the  workers  would  be  infringed.    This  is  going  to  result  in  employment 

generation. 

 

The Bill was introduced.
