  Our  institutes  are  not  only  famous 

in India, they are famous all over the world.  All the IIMs are working well.  We 

want  to  declare  them  as  institutes  of  national  importance  so  that  they  can  award 

degrees.    Hence,  it  will  be  a  regular  MBA  and  not  a  diploma.    It  will  not  be  a 

fellowship  but  a  PhD.    Most  important  issue  is  that  we  are  going  to  give  them 

autonomy since the Government believes that if we cannot trust the wise persons 

of  the  country  then  we  cannot trust  anybody.   Earlier, the  Government  appointed 

the Board, Chairman and the 'Search and Selection Committee'.  But now onwards 

the Government will no longer have any role in appointment which will be done by 

the Board of Governors.  Earlier, the Minister used to be the Chairman of the IIM 

Council.    Now  this  will  no  longer  be  the  case.    Besides  now  IIMs  would  be 

audited,  their  annual  report  would  be  laid  on  the  Table  of  the  House.    After 

autonomy IIMs can have excellent faculty and give them variable package.  They 

will be able to conduct their affairs themselves.  Hence, it is a historical Bill.
