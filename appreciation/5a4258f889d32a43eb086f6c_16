 The Union Cabinet under the chairmanship of 

hon. Prime Minister has sanctioned the setting up of Indian Institute of Petroleum 

and Energy in Vishakhapatanam of Andhra Pradesh.  This will be an institution of 

national importance as per the Act passed by the Parliament.  Through this Bill, the 

Government is going to fulfil another promise of public interest.  The Government 

of  Andhra  Pradesh  has  provided  to  the  Union  Government  200  acres  of  land  at 

Atakapalli village in Vishakhapatanam sometime back free of cost.  I express my 

heartfelt  gratitude  to  the  people  and  Government  of  Andhra  Pradesh.    One 

important  thing  in  this  regard  is  that  the  Government  of  India  has  given  this 

institution the status of national importance so that high quality facilities are made 

available over here.
