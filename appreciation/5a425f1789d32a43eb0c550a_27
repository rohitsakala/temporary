  India is a divided market in case of taxes.  

Under  the  successful  leadership  of  Shri  Narendra  Modiji  and  by  successful 

efforts of Shri Arun Jaitley India has resolved to play its role in the form of an 

organised  market.    We  are  going  to  present  ourselves  as  strong  and  capable 

partner in the global market.  It is the biggest tax reform since independence in 

the year 1947.  Today many countries want to develop economic ties with India.  

They want that India should strengthen its internal tax system, we have taken a 

step  to  strengthen  our  tax  system.    The  efforts  are  being  made  to  implement 

uniform  tax  structure  by  introducing  GST  in  the  country.    I  support  all  these 

bills and hope and expect that everybody will work unitedly in this regard.  We 

have  improved  our  business  relationships  with  neighbouring  countries  from 

Bangladesh to Myanmar except Pakistan.
