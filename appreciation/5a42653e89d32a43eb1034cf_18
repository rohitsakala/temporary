  I  would  like  to  congratulate  Hon. 

Minister of Finance for having brought in a revolutionary bill after 1947, in which 

more than 16 different taxes have been clubbed into one bouquet. India is reeling 

under  the  problem  of  black  money  for  many  years  and  corruption  had,  in  fact, 

brought a policy paralysis in the economy of our country in the last ten years. This 

bill,  if  passed,  will  give  impetus  to  our  economy  and  provide  a  common  market 

system to the people in place of a number of indirect taxes. This type of system is 

already  prevailing  in  more  than  150  countries  in  the  world.  In  order  to  study  the 

prevailing system, a  committee, comprising of Finance Ministers of the  states of 

our  country  had  also  visited  Australia,  Brazil  and  other  countries.  The 

implementation of GST will definitely augur well for the businessmen, employees, 

service sector, economy as well as consumers. Earlier, the Delhi Government had 

also opined that different types of tax systems create many problems and only one-

third  of  tax  is  collected  which  gives  rise  to  the  black  money.  This  has  also  been 

supported by FICCI. I support this bill.  

The discussion was not concluded.
