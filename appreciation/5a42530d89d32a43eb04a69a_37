  There is a tremendous possibility of growth 

of agriculture sector as it has the potential to give employment to a large section of 

our  population.  As  per  Prime  Minister  Shri  Narendra  Modi's  vision,  coordinated 

improvement  in  agriculture  productivity,  a  well  defined  plan  to  reduce  distance 

between lab and land, continuous use of new technologies in agriculture and export 

oriented  agricultural  produce  should  be  made  an  integral  part  of  the  country's 

economy. There is poor progress of soil survey in the Jharkhand state. We have to 

prove  two  things.  First,  our  farmers  have  to  feed  the  nation  and  the  world  and 

secondly,  our  agriculture  should  be  able  to  provide  financial  sustainability  to 

farmers.
