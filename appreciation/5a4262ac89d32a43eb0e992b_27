  I rise to support the National 

Waterways  Bill,  2015.    I  thank  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Minister  for  bringing 

this  very  important  and  revolutionary  Bill  in  the  House.    The  credit  for  Pradhan 

Mantri Sadak Yojana should also go to him.  Rivers would be used as Waterways.  

Rivers are State subject.  Something also has to be done in the law regarding the 

water level.  The Bill provides for new Waterways.  The biggest beneficiary of this 

would be Maharashtra.  West Bengal will get 14 waterways and Maharashtra will 

also benefit directly or indirectly from 14 waterways.  Kalyan, Thane and Mumbai 

on  Ullhas  river  included  in  my  Parliamentary  Constituency  would  give  immense 

benefit.   

 

SHRI  GEORGE  BAKER:  Mighty  Brahmaputra  requires  a  tremendous 

amount  of  dredging  to  save  thousands  of  lives  and  thousands  and  thousands  of 

acres  of  arable  land  and  also  the  State  of  West  Bengal.    If  dredging  is  done 

properly, there will be absolutely a perfect waterway.  At the same time, it would 

prevent a lot of flooding in the whole of West Bengal where annually a lot of the 

tax-payers' money goes in providing relief.  Let us use the money for the purpose 

of building and doing something concrete for the beauty of the country.
