 The reason as to why I appreciate the 

Bill  is  that  the  amendment  has  been  proposed  to  increase  the  authorized  capital 

from Rs.5000 crore to Rs.30,000 crore.  If we see the crises and the demand from 

the farmers' community, the proposed amount is not adequate. The present scenario 

is  that  credit  from  nationalized  banks  and  from  financial  institutions  is  not 

available.    That  is  why  there  is  a  crisis  in  the  agrarian  economy.    So,  NABARD 

should  come  forward  with  new  credit  and  interest  policy  so  that  more  farmers 

could  avail of  the  loan.   Even  though  NABARD  has  a  mechanism  for  disbursing 

loan, yet  a  major  portion of  the  loan is  flowing  to  urban  areas.   There  are  hardly 

any rural bank branches in North-Eastern States, even though there are regulations 

in  this  regard.    Even  in  my  own  State  of  Tripura  I  have  seen  that  though  some 

loans are disbursed for building bridges and creating infrastructure, but loan is not 

forthcoming  for  the  small  and  marginal  farmers  of  the  State  through  cooperative 

societies. The intention or the aim with which NABARD has been created has not 

been  fulfilled  as  it  is  not  reaching  out  to  the  far-flung  areas.    That  is  why,  the 

coverage of NABARD and its access to the real masses or the poor people should 

be further expanded.
