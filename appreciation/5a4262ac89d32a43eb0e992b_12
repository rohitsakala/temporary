  We  have  only  five  National  Waterways  even  after 

many  years  since  independence  and  the  state  of  these  Waterways  is  not  quite 

satisfactory.    I  would  really  say  that  this  Bill  is  a  big  leap  in  this  direction.    The 

Government has announced 101 new National inland Waterways and this is really 

a  revolutionary  step.    The  Sone,  Punpun,  Koshi,  Gandak  rivers  have  also  been 

included under the national waterways.  We are really grateful to the Government 

for this.  Our Waterways were better managed before independence as we used the 

Sone  river  as  Waterway  earlier.    We  would  use  canals  for  transportation  goods.  

This  Bill  would  definitely  expedite  the  pace  of  development  of  Waterways.    We 

would  also  like  to  request  to  develop  our  old  waterways.    A  big  canal  from  the 

Sone river from Dehri to Patna used to be a centre of business activity earlier and it 

had  a  great  potential  for  navigation.    Similarly,  the  canals  from  the  Gandak  river 

should  also  be  included  under  the  Waterways  as  these  would  facilitate 

transportation of goods and would also reduce pressure on roads.
