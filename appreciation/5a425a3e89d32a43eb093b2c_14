    I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Government 

for bringing in this Bill with such a good intention.  I have a age old relation with 

footwear  profession  as  we  have  footwear  shop  also.    I  would  like  to  make  a 

demand  that  Government  should  consider  to  open  an  institute  in  my  Lok  Sabha 

Parliamentary Constituency, Misrikh, Kanpur which is a major industrial hub.  It is 

an objective of our Government that youth should march towards a new level and 

they should be motivated to join these institutes and march ahead.
