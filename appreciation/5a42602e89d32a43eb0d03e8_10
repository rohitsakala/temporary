  The Bill declares certain Indian Institutes of 

Information Technology as institutions of national importance.  It seeks to develop 

new  knowledge  in  information  technology  and  provide  manpower  of  global 

standards  for  the  information  technology  industry.    This  is  the  need  of  the  hour 

considering  the  fact  that  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  bridge  the  gap  between  the 

Government,  academia  and  industry.    Therefore  this  is  a  welcome  move.    But  it 

should bridge the already existing urban and rural divide.  It should only augment 

the  educational  infrastructure  of  the  State  and  should  not  undermine  the  existing 

institutes.  The Bill also proposes that the Board of Governors of each Institute will 

comprise  of  15  members.    The  Chairperson  is  to  be  nominated  on  the 

recommendation of the Centre.  There should be one nominee each of the Central 

Government and the State Government concerned in the Board.  I personally feel 

that there is a need for nomination of one Member of Parliament from Lok Sabha 

and  one  from  Rajya  Sabha  in  the  Board.    Similarly,  the  composition  of  the  Co-

ordination Forum has to be mentioned clearly.  Apart from that, any dispute arising 

out of a contract between an institute and any of its employees will be referred to a 

Tribunal  of  Arbitration.    There  is  a  need  to  create  a  core  forum  to  address  any 

internal dispute before being referred to the Tribunal.
