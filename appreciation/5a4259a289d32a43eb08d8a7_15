 It is really a great blot on the head of our nation 

that we are at third position in the world as far as this stigma of AIDS is concerned.  

At present, approximately 3 crore 67 lakh people are suffering from this disease all 

over  the  world.   Approximately  21  lakh  people in  our  country  are  suffering  from 

this  disease.    Very  important  suggestions  have  been  made  in  the  Standing 

Committee on Health.  I would like to request the hon. Minister that though he has 

included  most  of  the  suggestions,  there  are  certain  suggestions  given  by  my 

colleagues  which  need  to  be  included.    The  Bill  also  provides  for  expanding  the 

scope  of  preventive  measures  and  preserving  the  confidentiality  of  the  patients.   

There are 19800 ICTC centres, 527 ART centres and 1108 linked ART centres in 

the country to give Anti-retro viral therapy. The Government has introduced a toll-

free  number  1097  on  which  any  person  in  the  country  can  get the solution of his 

problems.
