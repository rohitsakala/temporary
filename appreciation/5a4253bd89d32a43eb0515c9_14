  I  am  grateful  to  the 

House for supporting this Bill.  Of course in the course of the debate, many issues 

have  been raised  but,  I  would like to  bring  one thing to the notice  of this  House.  

Indian  security  is  by  and  large  good.    Change  being  a  continuous  process  and 

security  being  a  mix  of  manpower  and  technology,  these  things  will  keep 

changing.  We are at it.  The issue has been raised should we not have a specialised 

aviation  security  force?    Of  course,  these  things  are  being  looked  into  and 

constantly monitored and upgraded as and when they are required.  As far as civil 

aviation  is  concerned,  the  Bureau  of  Civil  Aviation  Security  set  the  patterns  and 

those patterns are followed by whichever agency mans and manages those airports.  

We  have  a  Hijacking  Contingency  Plan  in  place.    I  am  grateful  to  the  House  for 

having  supported  this  Bill  but  I  cannot  agree  with  certain  Members  who  do  not 

want the death penalty to be there.  I think all of us have to be practical and work 

together to overcome this menace.   

The Bill was passed.
