 This  legislation will not only merge 

all  other  17  types  of  taxes  into  one,  but  it  will  also  create  huge  employment 

generation in the country. It  will  also help small traders, farmers, agriculturists, 

big  industries  and  even  middlemen.  India  will  become  the  fastest-growing 

economy in the world, and we may even surpass the other developed countries. 

There will also be rise in GDP to the extent of 7.2 per cent. Since it is one-Bill-

one-nation-one-tax, we will be happy that there will be enhancement in taxation 

as we will be earning more money.
