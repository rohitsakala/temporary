  In  relation  to  the  granites  and  marbles sector, it 

seems  to  me  that  it  is  a  little  premature  to  change  the  customs  duty  from  10  per 

cent  to  the  WTO  bound  rate  of  40  per  cent.  This  is  a  small  amendment  of  the 

Customs Duty in one particular sector. So, we will not go to the extent of objecting 

to it or opposing it. The second limb is about VSNL  which was sold-off in parts.  

We  do  not  wish  the  Government,  which  will  be  in  the  possession  of  land  to  be 

subject to the Capital Gains Tax. So, in this regard, we are prepared to support the 

Government  unequivocally.  The  third  limb  of  this  tax  legislation  provides  a 

reduction in the requirement of the number of days that manufacturers of garments 

and  apparels  have  to  provide  employment  to  their  worker  in  order  to  get  a 

particular exemption to the Income Tax. We really need our garments and apparels 

manufacturers  to  create  more  employment,  not  less.  We  are  allowing  them  to 

provide less employment in order to get a particular incentive, but we really need 

to  encourage  them  to  provide  more  employment.  This  kind  of  employment  is 

directly related to the empowerment of women. Our Government ought to generate 

more  employment  and  create  safe  working  environments  for  our  women  in  the 

garments  and  apparels  sector.  That  should  be  the  thrust  of  our  policy.  The 

Government needs to focus on labour quite as much as the capitalists. I appreciate 

that  these  three  changes  to  our  taxation  laws  will  provide  a  little  bit  more 

incentives to our manufacturers, particularly, in the granites and marble sector and 

in the textile, apparel and garments sector.
