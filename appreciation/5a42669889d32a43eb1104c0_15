  In  fact,  this  is  an  important  Act  that 

encourages workers engaged in the organized sector.  Workers in our country are 

lowest  paid  but  our  government  has  felt  the  pain  of  those  workers.    It  is  a 

praiseworthy step that those workers who were earlier excluded from the eligibility 

criteria  of  getting  bonus  would  be  now  eligible  to  get  bonus.    Government  has 

considered the memorandums and suggestions made by trade unions and has taken 

decision  in  the  interest  of  workers  that  present  ceiling  limit  with  regard  to  bonus 

would be implemented w.e.f. 1st April, 2000.
