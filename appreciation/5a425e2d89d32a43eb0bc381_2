  All  of  us  understand  that  the  archaic  laws 

are  to  be  scrapped  as  they  are  creating  hindrance  in  judicial  and  administrative 

proceedings.  There have been so many laws in the statue book which were framed 

nearly 150 years ago to meet the requirements of those days but in course of time, 

they lost their relevance and their presence and are creating a lot of administrative 

problems.    A  large  pendency  of  cases  was  attributed  directly  to  the  archaic  laws.  

All  of  us  will  be  happy  if  the  obsolete  laws  which  create  administrative  and 

judicial hindrance are weeded out.  It should be a continuous process.  Our statue is 

full of obsolete laws, some dating back to the 19th century and early 20th century.  

We know that since 1834,6612 Central statues have been enacted and some point 

or the other, 3821 have been repealed.  The Repealing and Amending (Fourth) Bill 

proposes  to  repeal  295  obsolete  and  redundant  laws  lying  unnecessarily  on  the 

statute  book.    The  Department-Related  Parliamentary  Standing  Committee  on 

Personnel, Public grievances, Law  and Justice has suggested the  sunset  clause.   I 

make an appeal that the Government should take efforts to make the laws simple.  I 

fully endorse the views of the Standing Committee of Parliament in this regard.
