  The first amendment relates to Section 219 

(a)  (a)  under  which  in  case  of  BSNL,  the  tax  neutrality  provision  will  apply  and 

therefore  a  huge  burden  on  the  Government  of  paying  Capital  Gains  Tax  on  the 

basis  of  surplus  land  that  has  gone  to  the  Government  has  to  be  avoided.      The 

second amendment is in relation to the manufacturing factories with a requirement 

of  240  days  which  is  now  being  reduced  to  150  days.    Will  this  not  be  counter-

productive?  Apart from that with regard to the marble and granite industries,  the 

Government of  India  will  now have  more  flexibility  between  the 10  per  cent  and 

the 40 per cent capping, the question is, will tariff become unpredictable?  Infact, it 

is consistently saying that India is heading towards jobless growth.  Will the hon. 

Finance Minister please address this issue?
