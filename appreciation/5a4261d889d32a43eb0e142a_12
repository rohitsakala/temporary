  This Bill has been brought 

with a view to bringing about improvement in the society and to take care of the 

mental  health  of  human  being.      With  the  advancement  of  the  world  and  the 

disintegration of the social structure, mental tension is surging high.  I would like 

to say that when human beings get individualistic, then they hardly share their pain 

&  pleasure  with  other  persons.    Unambiguous  provisions  have  not  been  made 

regarding the rehabilitation of the patients in this Bill.  Providing employment to 

people should also be laid stress because unemployment is also one of the reasons 

of mental tension.   At the same time, better facilities for the treatment  of mental 

patients should be provided in the hospitals.
