  At the outset, I would like to thank 

the  Government  for  bringing  a  Bill  which  seeks  to  declare  20  IIMs  as  the 

institutions  of  national  importance  and  also  to  empower  those  institutes  to  award 

degrees  to  the  students.    This  will  facilitate  IIMs  to  become  autonomous 

institutions, prevent government interventions and allow good management to take 

place.    I  am  a  representative  from  Bihar  where  a  single  IIM  was  set  up  at  Bodh 

Gaya in 2015.  I would like to urge the Government that the number of seats in this 

institute  should  be  increased  to  300  or  400  like  other  IIMs.    Only  three  courses 

namely finance, marketing and HR are being run in this institute.  All the courses 

should be allowed to be offered in the IIM, Bodh Gaya.  The seats of this institute 

are not fully filled up and hence this is also required to be taken into account.  IIM, 

Bodh  Gaya  is  being  operated  under  the  control  of  IIM,  Kolkata  and  hence  it 

requires to be made independent.  Thatâ€™s why IIM Bodh Gaya should be made self-

reliant.    Even  today,  IIMs  are  reeling  under  the  shortage  of  faculties.    So,  the 

vacancy of faculties should be filled up at the earliest.  At last, I would like to urge 

the hon. Minister to set up one more IIM at Nalanda in Bihar.
