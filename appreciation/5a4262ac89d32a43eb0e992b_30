  A provision has been made 

in this Bill to introduce 101 new waterways by constituting a Waterway Authority 

so  that  Make  in  India  programme  becomes  a  reality.    I  belong  to  Western 

Rajasthan  and  one  part  of  this  area  is  adjacent  to  Sanchaur  in  Jalaur  district  and 

contour  level  from  Sancharu  to  Ran  of  Kuch  is  same.    When  the  hon.  Minister 

visited Jodhpur, I requested him if a canal is dredged from Sir Creek to Sanchaur, a 

new  port  can  be  constructed  in  this  area.    It  will  benefit  the  entire  Western 

Rajasthan  as  well  as  economy  of  the  state  and  manufacturers  of  entire  Northern 

India.
