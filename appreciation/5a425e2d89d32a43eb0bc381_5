 I congratulate the hon. Law Minister who took 

the initiate to enact this repealing Act.  In this year, we have already passed three 

repealing Acts, repealing about 883 Acts.  Now, through this Bill, we are going to 

repeal 295 Acts.  Now, as these laws are obsolete, redundant and are not necessary 

in the given circumstances, the Government had taken the initiative, and all of us 

should support this Bill.  On behalf of my Party, we are supporting it.
