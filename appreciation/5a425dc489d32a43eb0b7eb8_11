    Provision  of 

Transfer  Policy  of  captive  mines  is  essential  because  if  some  planet  is  in  sick 

condition,  bank's  finances  are  also  involved  in  it,  if  it  gets  closed  .    So,    people 

would  become  unemployed  if  this  provision  is  not  being  made.   Trade  should  be 

simplified, employment should be generated, so it was felt necessary that transfer 

policy  should  be  given  to  captive  mining  lease.    Thus  this  Amendment  has  been 

brought.    Last  time  when  an  amendment  in  the  Act  was  brought,  a  clause  was 

added in Section 12 A wherein only those mines would be transferred which would 

be  auctioned.    No  other  mines  would  be  transferred.      So  we  are  opening  these 

mines.    States  would  implement  this  and  provision  and  the  revenue  generated 

would to state exchequer.  Centre is providing this facility so that no plant should 

be closed and unemployment should not grow. I would like to inform that NMET 

has  been  constituted.    Mining  department  is  trying  to  make  full  development  by 

way of exploration.  There was a discussion about increasing land ceiling. I would 

like to inform  you that there are some  minerals and areas where area needs to be 

increased.  I am happy to inform that auction notice of 43 mines have already been 

issued.    In  the  second  phase  auction  notice  of  42  mines  is  likely  to  be  auctioned 

soon.  In this way 100 mines will be auctioned, some more suggestions have been 

received.  We will definitely consider these.  

The Bill was passed.
