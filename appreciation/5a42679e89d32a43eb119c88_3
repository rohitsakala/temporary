  Agriculture  is  still  a  primary  source  of 

livelihood for 60 to 70 per cent population in our country.  But its contribution to 

GDP  is  only  17.5  per  cent.    The  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural 

Development  Act  was  passed  in  1981  for  the  purpose  of  improvement  in 

agriculture  and  rural  infrastructure.    The  authorized  capital  of  NABARD  up  till 

now  has  been  Rs.5000  crore,  which  after  this  amendment  will  increase  up  to 

Rs.30,000  crore.    This  Bill  seeks  to  enhance  the  authorized  capital  of  NABARD 

from  Rs.5,000  crore  to  Rs.  30,000  crore.    The  primary  effect  of  the  Bill  is  to 

transfer  the  share  of  RBI  to  Central  Government.    Another  purpose  of  the 

Amendment Bill is to update the Act in consonance with the current situation.  The 

Bill  also  proposes  that  the  NABARD  will  provide  credit  and  other  services  to 

enterprise with investment up to Rs.10 crore and it is increased from the figure of 

Rs.20  lakh  in  the  original  Act.    Through  the  proposed  amendments,  the  existing 

conflict of interest is removed from the RBI and the Government.  The Bill is an 

updating act, changing the law in consonance with other legislations and industrial 

practices.
