  The  Enforcement  of  Security  Interest  and 

Recovery  of  Debts  Laws  and  Miscellaneous  Provisions  (Amendment)  Bill,  2016 

will turn out to be an effective instrument to recover loan from those people who 

have made away with the bank loan to foreign countries.  That is why, I support it.  

This  Bill  provides  for  electronic  registration  which  will  put  the  check  on  getting 

loan from various banks by showing the same property.  Furthermore, our country 

is  a  country  of  the  poor.    Hence,  the  provisions  relating  to  the  recovery  of  loans 

from the poor should be made lenient.  At the same time, the role of middlemen in 

securing loans on the basis of fake documents is also required to be checked.  Once 

again, I would like to urge that a lenient view should be taken in the recovery of 

loan from the poor people.
