 The primary objective of the Bill is to regulate 

adolescents from working in certain types of employment and to permit children in 

family enterprises subject to certain conditions.  However, the provision must not 

serve  as  a  loophole  to  allow  for  exploitation  of  child  in  the  name  of  family  run 

enterprises.    Most  children,  who  are  academically  inclined,  do  not  have  time  for 

anything  other  than  eat,  sleep  and  study.    This  leads  to  lack  of  communication 

skills,  team  work,  discipline  and  most  importantly  the  common  sense  in  them.    I 

grew up in USA, working from the age of 10 years.  I worked about 10 to 20 hours 

per week.  It gave me life-skills.  It taught me the dignity the labour.  We should 

encourage part-time work and should take every step to instill dignity of labour in 

children.   But  it  should  be  based  on  minimum  performance  in  school.   I  strongly 

feel  that  the  Labour  Ministry  should  also  have  a  monitoring  mechanism  at  the 

Central  level  to  keep  an  eye  on  family  enterprises  to  ensure  that  this  provision  is 

not misused.  The Bill adds a new category of persons 'adolescents' children who 

are  between  age  group  of  14  and  18  are  categorised  as  adolescents  and  are 

prohibited  from  hazardous  processes.    This  is  also  a  welcome  move  of  the 

Government.    The  penal  provisions  in  the  Bill  are  too  weak.    I  request  the  hon. 

Minister to double these penal provisions because this is not enough of a deterrent.  

I  would  urge  upon  the  government  that  with  these  changes,  we  also  bring  in 

enforcement to ensure that it is not abused and children are treated with dignity.
