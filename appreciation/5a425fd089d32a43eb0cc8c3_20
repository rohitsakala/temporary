 This Bill is important because it 

is aimed at regulating a sector, which has a maximum growth potential and which 

is the second largest employment giver in the country and which contributes about 

9 per cent to our GDP.  This Bill will ensure that the trust, the goodwill, which was 

missing in this sector, will be brought in again.  I would request the hon. Minister 

to give some relief to the existing projects.  I would also request him to reduce the 

approval  time  for  developers  required  in  different  phases  of  project.    I  think, 

maximum developers should be included in the ambit of this Bill.
