 This Bill is an example of the dedication of our 

hon. Prime Minister and the hon. Minister of Health regarding the issue of health.  

We  seldom  come  across  such  a  complete  Bill.    In  our  country  a  poor  works 

throughout the day and sleep soundly.  He suffers no mental illness.  99 per cent of 

such  patients  suffer  from  sporadic  bouts  of  such  illness.    They  are  not  ill 

permanently and they have full capacity to take decision.  It is thoroughly wrong 

to  say  that  a  mental  patient  is  unable  to  form  a  judgement  regarding  his  health.  

Advanced directive is a very good step.  The provision to decriminalize suicide is 

very  progressive  as  is  insurance  regarding  mental  health  and  banning  ECT  in 

emergency.    Today,  there  is  no  shortage  of  psychotherapist.    This  Bill  is  very 

revolutionary and very progressive for which I profusely thank the hon. Minister.
