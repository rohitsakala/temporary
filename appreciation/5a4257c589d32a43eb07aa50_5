  The  most  important  thing  which  I  like  in  the 

Bill is the 'autonomy' given to these Institutes.  That is what we required for a long 

time.  Unless you give autonomy along with responsibility and accountability, we 

will  not  get  the  desired  results.    Apart  from  20  IIMs,  there  are  hundreds  of 

institutions  which  are  functioning  in  the  market.    We  do  not  have  any  idea  as  to 

what  sort  of  education  they  are  imparting  to  the  students  who  are  studying  over 

there.  I would like to ask the Government that whether there standards equivalent 

to  that  of  IIMs?    Secondly,  Government  has  made  provisions  in  this  Bill  that  all 

these  IIMs  will  be  under  the  purview  of  the  RTI  also.    So,  we  will  have 

opportunities  to  know  what  is  really  happening.   Apart  from  that, some  institutes 

are indulged in current practices with regard to admission process.  Similarly, fees 

are  very  high,  which  one  cannot  afford.    Students  who  had  taken  loan  for  their 

education, are not able to repay their loan just because they have not got the job of 

that  remuneration  or  of  that  quality.    So,  we  have  the  increasing  NPAs  on  this 

account also.  This is again a matter of concern.  So, what is the Government going 

to do to protect talented students?  Apart from the existing institutions, suppose a 

new IIM is to be opened than I would like to know from the Government that who 

has got the power to form the Board?  In the education field when we talk about 

reservations  and  other  things,  then  we  have  the  talented  people  from  our  SC/ST 

categories  also,  therefore,  we  should  impart  a  very  high  and  standard  level  of 

education to our students.
