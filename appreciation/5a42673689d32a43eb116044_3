 The BIS is a body which determines the 

Indian  standards  and  also  it  harmonizes  the  national  standards  with  authentic 

international  standards.    This  Bill  will  be  helpful  for  the  consumers  and  the 

businessmen alike.  The main functions of BIS are standardisation, formalisation, 

certification,  granting  licence  to  use  trademarks  on  the  products  and  processes 

under  licence  and  to  take  delineate  actions  against  the  defaulters.    Our  standard 

regime  is  still  in  a  nascent  stage  of  development.    Indian  exports  face  many 

difficulties on grounds of meeting mandatory standards.  We are extending the Bill 

up  to  the  'services'  but  the  term  'services'  is  not  clearly  defined.    It  enables  the 

Governments  to  bring  mandatory  certifications  regime.    There  will  be  self-

declaration  of  conformity  against  any  standard.    This  will  also  enable  the 

Government  of  India  to  implement  mandatory  hallmarking  of  precious  metal 

articles  but  there  are  other  metals  like  iron,  brass  and  steel  which  are  very 

important  for  the  consumers.    It  has  not  specified  the  accreditation  process  for 

checking laboratories.  The WGC study said that the BIS lacks adequate resources 

for testing, monitoring and enforcement.  Anyway, this Bill is quite good.
