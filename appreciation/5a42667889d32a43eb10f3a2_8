 

I 

congratulate 

the 

Government  for  bringing  in  such  a  wonderful  legislation.    The  Government  has 

accepted  majority  of  the  recommendations  made  by  the  Committee.    I  truly 

appreciate  the  efforts  made  by  all  the  activists  who  said  that  the  disability  as  a 

result  of acid  attack also should  be  considered.   Percentage  of  reservation  for the 

persons with disabilities should be increased to five per cent.  This should not be 

considered  a  charity  rather  we  should  have  right-based  approach.    They  should 

have dignity of life.  For this, we should form a Commission both at national and 

State levels.  Instead of making separate identity cards, some  provision should be 

made in AADHAR cards only.    There is a need to provide budgetary support as 

well as good monitoring system for the Institute of Mental Health at Secunderabad, 

Telangana.  Last but not the least, I would like to add that if we work with a right 

based approach then all the persons with disabilities in our country will feel that it 

is not our disability that counts but it is our ability that counts.  I sincerely believe 

that this Bill will create such an ecosystem in the country.
