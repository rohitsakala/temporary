  This Bill introduced by the 

hon.  Finance  Minister  will  definitely  put  curb  on  benami  transactions  to  some 

extent but we need a comprehensive bill to prevent the inflow and outflow of black 

money  and  we  need  to  bring  back  the  black  money  stashed  abroad  and  for  this 

stringent  provisions  should  be  made  in  the  Bill.    Big  businessmen  invest  black 

money  in  real  estate  ingeniously.    Black  money  is  also  invested  in  the  film 

industry.    There  should  be  a  limit  as  to  how  much  property  one  should  have.    A 

very few people have lots of property while a major chunk of population is dying 

due to starvation.  People are investing black money in purchasing large tracks of 

land  because  they  know  that  after  20  years  they  will  get  50  fold  returns  from  it.  

Thus people invest their black money in an ingenious way.  I, therefore request the 

hon. Minister to kindly pay attention to these aspects also.
