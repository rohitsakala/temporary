 Transportation through waterways is very 

economical as compared to other modes.  At present, inland waterways handle just 

0.5  per  cent  of  the  total  traffic  in  the  country,  whereas  in  China  waterways 

contribution is 20 per cent.  With waterways coming into picture, there will surely 

be a decrease in the accidental deaths as well as pollution.  The waterways have the 

potential to transport 12.45 lakh tonnes of cargo per annum after its development 

by  2018-19.    It  would  boost  industry,  employment  generation  and  GDP  growth.  

The  stretch  of  the  river  Godavari  in  Telangana  covers  industrialized  towns.    It 

should also be included.  The National Waterway-4 should be upgraded to include 

the  stretch  of  the  river  Godavari  between  Kaleshwaram  and  Bhadrachalam.    It 

should  be  from  Kaleshwaram  to  Dowlaiswaram.    It  is  necessary  to  revise  the 

Polavaram  project  design  to  suit  the  navigation  of  large  vessels  on  the  river 

Godavari.
