    I  congratulate  the  hon. 

Finance Minister for introducing the GST Bill.  The Hon. Finance Minister has 

a very balanced approach towards setting up the GST council and this approach 

has been instrumental in the introduction of this Bill.  Such a council has been 

constituted  first  time  in  the  history  of  India.    The  Centre  and  the  State 

Governments  have  been    granted  equal  rights  in  this  council  which  is  a 

historical  move  and  thus,  the  Government  has  set  up  a  truly  federal  council.  

The GST will bring all the existing taxes under one umbrella and it will help in 

setting up single window system and it will also help towards the ease of doing 

business.  It will reduce the overheads costs and thereby the capital investment 

of  the  manufacturers  will  come  down  which  will  help  their  end  products  to 

compete  in  the  international  market.        It  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  our 

exports and will also help in setting up proper monitoring mechanism.
