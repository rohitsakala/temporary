 There is a huge spurt in urban population in 

India and hence this growth of urbanisation needs to be complimented by growth in 

urban  infrastructure  and  delivery  capabilities.    Although,  the  rural  poverty  is 

reducing  at  a  faster  rate  than  the  poverty  in  the  urban  areas  due  to  MNREGA  and 

other  poverty  alleviation  programmes  in  the  rural  areas.    Housing  for  All  by  2022 

project  of  the  Union  government  is  an  ambitious  project    but  it  is  yet  to  take  off 

because  it  needs  greater  coordination  from  the  States  and  also  support  from  the 

bankers.  In our State of Andhra Pradesh, a dwelling unit costs around Rs. 4.8 lakhs.  

So, I would request the Government to increase the subsidy component.  Similarly, 

selection of beneficiaries is also a very critical issue and hence I would request the 

hon. Minister to give a larger say for the MPs to participate in the selection process 

and for execution of this project.
