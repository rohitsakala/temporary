 Without 'Institutes of Technology', our 

country  cannot  make  any  progress.   So, the  role  of  IITs  and  engineering  colleges 

becomes  pivotal.   I  thank  the  Central  Government  for  providing  an  IIT  at  Ropar.  

However, there is a lack of adequate infrastructure over there.  So, I urge upon the 

Central  Government  to  provide  ample  fund  for  this  IIT.    There  was  a  time  when 

Punjab was at the helm o affairs in the realm of technology too.  Ludhiana, Khanna 

and Gobindgarh were the hug of industries.  However, the condition of industries 

in Punjab is dismal at present.  There has been a flight of industries from Punjab.  

As  a  result,  students  of  Punjab  do  not  want  to  opt  for  technical  education  as

employment in this field in the state is not assured.  I appeal to the Government to 

provide  a  package  for  technical  institutes  in  Punjab.    Incentives  must  also  be 

provided for technical institutes in Punjab so that these institutes can also provide 

employment to the local students.  The SC and OBC students are not being given 

scholarships for 2-3 years.  I urge upon the Central Government to timely release 

the scholarship amount to the state so that the SC & OBC students do not suffer.
