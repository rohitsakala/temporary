 The steep rise of prices of vegetables 

and  pulses  is  a  matter  of  serious  concern.  People  of  Tamil  Nadu  consume  larger 

quantities  of  pulses.  Through  many  innovative  and  imagination  schemes,  the 

Government of Tamil Nadu under the leadership of our Hon'ble Chief Minister has 

managed to ensure that the common people in the state have been protected against 

the ill-effects of price rise. The Amma Canteen Scheme has had a salutary impact 

on  keeping  a  check  on  food  prices  in  Tamil  Nadu.  The  lower  production  is  the 

reason for price rise. Lack of polices or clarity on agriculture planning has led to 

this crisis. India is facing a crisis also because of deficient rainfall in one end and 

excess  rainfall  in  the  other  side.  Crisis  is  mainly  in  tur  and  urad  dals,  two  of  the 

most consumed pulses. Pulses production in India has shown less than 40 per cent 

growth  during  the  last  5  decades.  But  by  merely  checking  the  prices  of  pulses, 

inflation is not going to be under control. There has been an overall increase in the 

prices  of  almost  every  commodity.  I  urge  upon  the  Union  Government  to  take 

appropriate steps to control the soaring price rise graph and maintain the prices as 

lower as possible for the poor and middle class people of this country.
