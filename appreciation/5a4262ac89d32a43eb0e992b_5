  Inland  waterways  are  the  most  inexpensive 

mode  of  transport  for  both  people  and  cargo.    Not  only  do  they  reduce  cost,  but 

they  also  reduce  pollution,  reduce  accidents  and  reduce  traffic  congestion.    All 

over  the  world,  rivers  have  been  used  for  transportation  of  goods  and  people  for 

centuries.    Waterways  were  not  given  due  importance  in  independent  India.  

Andhra  Pradesh  Government  is  fully  committed  to  developing  the  inland 

waterways.  Andhra Pradesh is looking at developing the State into a multi-mode 

logistics hub.  Amaravati, our new Capital, is being built on the river Krishna .  A 

lot of inland waterways will be flowing through the city.  Many canals are going to 

be  coming  up,  and  we  are  even  planning  water  taxis.    The  Buckingham  Canal 

being  connected  to  all  other  waterways  will  be  able  to  connect  every  part  of  the 

country.
