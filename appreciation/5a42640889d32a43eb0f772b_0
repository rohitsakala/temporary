 I would like to 

clarify  all  the questions being  raised today  about  reservation in  the country.   The 

entire nation and the House should brood over how to eliminate the caste system in 

India as this is causing caste conflict.  This caste conflict can be resolved only by 

providing equal opportunity to all.  But equal opportunity stands to mean providing 

equal opportunity in all the walks of life.  The social revolution can take place in 

India the day when the son of a Collector and a Peon starts studying in  the same 

school.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  hon.  Prime  Minister  for  working  towards  this 

direction.    If  the  people  from  the  marginalized  section  of  the  society  get  all  the 

rights and equal opportunities then they can stand up equal to anybody else.  Equal 

opportunity  will  be  meaningful  only  when  equal  facilities  are  made  available.  

Lohia  ji  rightly  said  that  special  opportunity  is  required,  not  reservation.    The 

eligibility starts automatically evolving with the time the opportunity is provided.  

This can easily be understood that no one can learn how to swim without getting an 

opportunity  to  walk  into  the  pond.    At  last,  I  would  like  to  salute  all  great 

personalities  like  Swami  Dayanand  Saraswati,  Vivekananda,  Raja  Ram  Mohan 

Roy  who  contributed  towards  the  social  revolution.    Lastly,  the  hon.  Prime 

Minister  has  done  a  lot  for  Dr.  Ambedkar.    I  request  him  to  construct  a  huge 

memorial of Lohiaji in Delhi.  Crores of backwards in India would be grateful to 

him.
