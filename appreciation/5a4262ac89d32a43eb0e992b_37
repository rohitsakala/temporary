  I  support  the  Bill.  The  subject 

which was pending since 1985 has been brought to the mainstream. Our colleague 

from West Bengal will be  agreed that the proposed work is immensely useful for 

the poor. Allahabad, Varanasi, and Haldia are waterways of  the Ganges on which 

Kaithi  and  Balua  are  two  important  places.  The  goods  brought  from  Kaithi  by 

water-way  can  easily  be  transported  to  Haryana  and  Delhi.  In  the  same  way,  the 

goods from Balua can be transported to Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. Roads must 

be constructed to connect proposed jetties.
