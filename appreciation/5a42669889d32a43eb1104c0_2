 I feel that we all respect the labour of 

the  workers  and  we  see  them  closely.    The  last  amendment  was  in  2007.    I 

congratulate the Government for taking this commendable step or at least doubling 

the amount.  The ceiling should be minimum so that less than a certain would not 

be given.  My suggestion to that Government is to consider this as to why repeated 

amendments need to be brought in the House.  While congratulating the Minister I 

also request that if a ceiling is to be set then it should be a minimum ceiling.  Do 

not be much concerned about the maximum ceiling.  For this a mechanism can be 

worked  out.    Through  you  I  would  like  to  give  suggestion  to  the  Government  to 

find out  a  way  co-relate the bonus  with the  pay  commission  recommendation.   It 

would  be  much  better  I  think  if  it  is  also  link  with  the  industrial  development 

index.  The profitability of any industry cannot be the basis for bonus.  Decisions 

regarding  industrial  sector  should  be  separate  from  that  of  agriculture  sector.    I 

support this Bill and conclude.
