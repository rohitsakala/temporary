 It has been announced under the 

leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi that housing facility will be made 

available for all till 2022. 100 smart cities will be developed in the country and 500 

cities will be linked to rejuvenation programme. Top 14 countries of the world have 

shown interest in developing smart cities. Amrit Mission has been assigned the work 

of creating infrastructural facilities in cities with the cost of Rs. 50 thousand crores 

from 2015 to 2020. A scheme-HRIDAY  has been started, that will help  to develop 

12  historical  cities  of  heritage  importance.  A  provision  of  Rs.  500  crore  has  been 

made for it. In Haridwar region there is lack of transport infrastructure and there is 

traffic jams because of this. So I request to introduce Metro train/Mono rail between 

Haridwar to Rishikesh .
