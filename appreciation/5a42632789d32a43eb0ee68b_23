  This  Bill  provides  opportunity  of  investment  to 

the private sector.  Under such circumstances how will the students belonging to the 

poor  and  middle  class  families  will  be  able  to  afford  the  fee  of  such  institutes.  

Therefore,  there  is  a  need  for  providing  fee  concession  to  the  meritorious  students 

and those belonging to the middle class.  Unless the government pays attention to the 

real tenant this Bill meant for IIITs is not going to serve its purpose.  I would urge the 

government  to  bring  in  cooperative  sector  under  the  ambit  of  the  Bill.    When  the 

government is bringing PPP system why can't it go for cooperative system?  I would 

urge that atleast five IITs should be set up in Bihar.
