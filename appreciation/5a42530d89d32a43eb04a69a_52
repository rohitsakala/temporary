  The Government is committed towards 

doubling the income of the farmers during the next five years.  An allocation of Rs. 

56992 crore has been made in this year's budget for the agriculture and the allied 

sectors.  There is an urgent need to ensure the disbursal of funds for the purpose of 

increasing  the  productivity  of  the  land  and  also  for  carrying  out  the  research  and 

development for finding optimum variety of seeds, fertilizers and development of 

new  techniques  for  boosting  the  farming.    Providing  irrigating  facilities  to  the 

farms  would  itself  result in  doubling  of  the  yield.   I  would like  to thank the hon. 

Prime  Minister  and  the  minister  of  Agriculture  for  making  excellent  arrangement 

for the irrigation sector by conceptualizing the Pradhan Mantri Sinchayee Yojana.  

The  step of  introducing  Neem  coated  urea  which  would  give  a  death blow  to  the 

black marketing is a very welcome measure.
