  The  main  idea  of  the  Government  to 

bring  this  Bill  is  to  transfer  the  captive  mining  leases  granted  otherwise  than 

through  auction  and  would  facilitate  banks  and  financial  institutions  to  liquidate 

stressed  assets  where  a  company  or  its  captive  mining  lease  mortgaged.    This 

would also strengthen the terms and conditions.  The transfer provisions will also 

allow mergers and acquisitions of companies and facilitate ease of doing business 

for  companies  to  improve  profitability  and  decrease  costs  of  the  companies 

dependent  on  supply  of  mineral  ore  from  captive  leases.    The  transfer  of  captive 

leases  would  be  subject  to  the  consideration  of  enforcing  Performance  Security, 

Mine  Development  and  Production  Agreement  (MDPA),  and  realization  of  an 

appropriate  amount,  if  any,  if  found  feasible  at  the  time  of  framing  terms  and 

conditions.
