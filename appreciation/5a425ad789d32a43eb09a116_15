  The  Benami  Transaction 

(Prohibition) Act was enacted in 1988 to curb the tendency of benami transactions 

across the country.  But it is also true that this objective of the government was not 

fulfilled because there were various shortcoming in it.  Now, after removing these 

shortcomings  this  Bill  has  been  brought.    As  per  the  Economic  Survey,  many 

economists are of the opinion that 70 per cent wealth of the country is concentrated 

in  the  hands  of  only  10-15  per  cent  people  and  in  the  last  70  years  rich  have 

become  richer  and  poor  more  poorer.    The  main  reason  behind  this  fact  is  that 

black money generated in this country have been stashed in certain other countries 

and benami properties were purchased here.  I feel that after the passage of this Bill 

this trend is going to end in this country and disparity between poor and rich will 

also come to end.  I would like certain clarifications from the government.  There 

is  a  need  to  bring  certain  amendments  in  Income  Tax  Act  also. There  are  certain 

people in the society who wish to transfer their property to their relatives and what 

is  the provision  in  those  cases.   Another point  is  that  in  our  country  various  land 

are owned by Gods and few lands of Gurudwara Sahib are owned by Guru Granth 

Sahib also.  In this regard clarifications must be given in this Bill so that there is no 

confusion left.  I feel that comprehensive clarification should be given in this Bill.
