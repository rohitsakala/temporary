 this Bill gives me the conviction that it 

will perhaps put an end to brain drain which has been a problem in our country for 

a  while.    In  this  Bill  particular  stress  has  been  laid  on  three  words  namely 

education,  training  and  research  in  the  field  of  biotechnology.    The  setting  up  of 

this  center  would  give  a  fillip  to  these  activities.    I  would  like  to  add  one  more 

thing that this country badly needs the process of owning patents.  It has been our 

misfortune  that  we  have  been  lacking  in  having  a  process  or  institution  which 

could establish that a particular research is owned by us.  If we are not having any 

biodiversity and if we ignore the deep value offered by it then we will not be able 

to move  much ahead in terms of biotechnology.  We need to identify those areas 

and the extent to which the knowledge of biotechnology will be used in them.  The 

creation of only biological names of the medicinal plants will not suffice.  We need 

to be aware of and codify local names of those plants also for the simple purpose 

of strengthening our case in case of any patent fight.  Had we been able to record 

the local names of those plants, we would have scarcely lost our battle for patents.  

We  do  not  lack  intellectual  property  and  capability.    It  is  already  with  us.  

However,  we  need  to  have  resources  for  patenting  that  knowledge  and  this 

precisely is the purpose of this Bill also.
