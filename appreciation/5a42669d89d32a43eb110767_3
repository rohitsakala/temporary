  I  rise  to  support  the  Insolvency  and 

Bankruptcy  Code.    A  large  number  of  industries  whether  they  belong  to  private 

sector  or  public  sector  in  the  country  are  lying  closed.    The  closure  has  rendered 

the  workers  unemployed  and  they  have  been  waiting  to  receive  their  legal  dues.  

The  second  aspect  is  that  the  machinery  costing  crores  of  rupees  has  also  been 

lying unused. One of the main reasons behind this state of affairs is the lack of any 

effective  bankruptcy  law  in    the  country.      Presently,    the  winding  up  of  the 

liquidation  proceedings  require  that  one  has  to  deal  with  plethora  of  laws  for  the 

process to be completed.  I would also like to thank the hon. Minister for according 

priority to the claims of the workers.  A large number of industries in the fertilizer 

and chemicals sector are lying closed even though they have thousands of acres of 

land  and  other  assets  with  them  but  they  are  unable  to  utilise  them  due  to 

settlement  of  liquidation  process.    There  is  a  need  for  the  proper  use  of  these 

national properties and these industries should be revived.  There is a large number 

of  cooperative  industries  in  our  country  particularly  in  Maharashtra.    They  are 

facing closure on account of mismanagement and lack of new technology.  There 

should be a proposal for their revival.  This Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill, 

2015 is for the welfare of the people, industries and the entire country. 

The discussion was not concluded.
