  This  is  basically  a  Bill  for  the 

establishment of a Regional Centre for Biotechnology under UNESCO.  I wish to 

inform all the hon. Members that the genesis of this Bill dates back to 2003 when 

at  the  167th  Meeting  of  the  General  Body  of  UNESCO,  the  then  Science  and 

Technology Minister of this country had moved a proposal that a Regional Centre 

for Bio-Technology should be created in India which should coordinate with all the 

countries  of  Asia,  share  their  experiences,  research  and  help  each  other  in  all  the 

cutting edge technologies.  I feel fortunate that the time has finally come when it 

came  to  Parliament  for  passing.    With  the  advancement  in  the  field  of 

biotechnology  there  is  a  need  for  sharing  of  information  and  knowledge  at  the 

international  level  also.    This  Institution  is  basically  going  to  focus  on  the 

education part, the training part  and the  research part.   I  have to say  that  this bio 

technology is relatively a new field which emerged in the last 15 years or 20 years 

in  a  big  way.    Around  30  years  back,  the  Department  of  Bio  Technology  was 

created  in  India.  At  the  moment,  we  are  in  a  position  to  become  a  global  leader.  

This  field has  a  huge  potential  for  societal  benefits  and  economic  transformation.  

With the coming up and development of this Institute, the level of research that we 

intend  to  do  in  this  country  will  go  up  to  the  international  global  standards.    We 

have the potential to solve many critical issues of the society which are related to 

agriculture  and  health.    I  would  say  that  this  a  very  long  pending  Bill.    If 

Parliament gives its consent to this Bill, then this Institute can start functioning in a 

big way and we can train people from all over the country in a big way.
