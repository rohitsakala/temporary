 India is an agriculture country. The agriculture 

has been given full importance by the government since its inception in 2014. Soil 

of  every  field  will  be  examine  to  enrich  it.  The  farmers  will  get  insurance  and 

benefit  in  the  natural  calamity  under  crop  insurance  scheme.  The  farmers  are 

provided big relief on loan interest. I think this government is standing in support 

of farmers and agriculture labours. The farmers will get more prices on their crops.
