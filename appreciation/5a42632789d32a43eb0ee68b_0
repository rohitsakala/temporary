 

India  has  been  recognized  world  over  as  the  IT  soft  power.  To  promote  this  IT 

industry,  we  provided  IIITs  in  Government  sector.    Later  on  it  was  felt  that  there 

should be public-private partnership and 20 such IIITs with public-private partnership 

were  mooted  in 2010.   Now, nearly  15 IIITs  are  already  operational  in the  country.  

This year, their students will be graduating for the first time and IIIT Bill provides for 

granting  degrees  to  their  students.    But  IIIT  public-private  partnership  mode  is  a 

different  mode  because  there  are  different  stakeholders.    In  IIITs,  it  is  only  the 

Central  Government  but  in  IIITPPP,  it  is  the  Central  Government,  the  State 

Government and the private sector.  So instead of amending the law, we have brought 

this Bill and I believe that this Bill will be passed unanimously.  We will consider all 

the good suggestions made in this regard.
