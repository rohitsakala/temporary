  It  is  the  commitment  of  the 

government  to  address  the  rural  poverty  by  ensuring  the  prosperity  of  the 

agriculture and it is very well on course to achieve this objective.  The Government 

has  also  made  certain  effective  provisions  in  the  Union  Budget  to  achieve  this 

purpose.  The Government has accorded top priority to the villages, poor farmers 

and agriculture in the Union Budget 2017-18.  The growth rate in agriculture sector 

has started to touch the figure of 4.1 per cent.  However, it is the non-cooperative 

attitude  of  the  Bihar  Government,  which  has  kept  Bihar  from  reaping  the  full 

advantage  of  the  various  farmer  welfare  programmes  of  the  Union  Government.  

An  allocation  of  Rs.  5000  crore  and  Rs.48000  crore  has  been  made  for  micro 

irrigation  and  rural  employment  i.e. MNREGA  respectively.   The  adverse impact 

of  demonetization  is  also  nowhere  to  be  seen  on  farmers.    The  sowing  area  of 

wheat in rabi season has increased by 8 per cent in the country as compared to the 

corresponding  period  in  the  previous  year.  Demonetization  has  had  no  effect  on 

agriculture and farmers.  The Government of India is trying to double the income 

of  farmers  through  different  programmes.    Agricultural  growth  will  bring  about 

prosperity of farmers and agricultural labourers.
