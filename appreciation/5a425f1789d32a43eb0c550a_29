    GST  has  been  seen  as  a  major 

economic reform this county has ever witnessed.  Indirect tax in the country is 

neither  too  much  nor  too  low  as  compared  to  developed  countries  and  is 

between  18  to  20  per-  cent.    The  proposed  GST  is  aimed  at  implementing  a 

uniform  and  transparent  tax  regime.    It  will  boost  the  revenue  of  the 

Government  and  the  whole  system  will  be  overhauled  and  we  will  get  rid  of 

multi-level taxation, it would be easy for traders to deposit tax, inflation would 

be tamed, GDP will boost.  GST tax regime would replace 17 Central and State 

taxes.  The retail cost of most of the items would be reduced, GDP would jump 

1-2 per  cent, e-commerce  would  strengthen, indirect  tax  collection  would  rise, 

the  confidence  of  international  investors  would  be  restored,  the  cost  of 

manufactured items would be reduced.  Logistics companies would benefit the 

most.    The  cost  of  small  cars  would  certainly  be  reduced.    The  FMCG 

companies  would  be able  to  reduce the tax  and logistics  cost.   The demand  of 

cement would rise.  The reduction of cost as a result of implementation of GST 

would boost demand.  The liquor shall remain out of the ambit of GST.  Union 

and  State  Governments  would  keep  on  levying  taxes  on  petrol  and  petroleum 

products.  With the implementation of GST, taxes like excise duty, service tax, 

VAT,  entertainment  tax,  luxury  tax,  lottery  tax,  entry  tax,  octroi  etc  would  be 

abolished.    With  the  implementation  of  GST  growth  rate  would  rise,  black-

marketing would end and black money would be reined in and the dream of 'one 

country one tax' would be accomplished.
