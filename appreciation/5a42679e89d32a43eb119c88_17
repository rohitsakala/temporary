  The main objective of this Bill is to 

increase the capital of 'NABARD' from rupees five thousand crores to rupees thirty 

thousand crores which will increase with the time after consultation of the Reserve 

Bank of India.  I appreciate the Government for bringing this Bill.  This will help 

the rural artisans and rural labourers in getting unemployment at their native places 

and  their  income  will  also  doubled.    I  want  to  draw  the  attention  of  the 

Government towards the problems being faced by the farmers.   Small and medium 

farmers  do  not  get  loans.    I  request  the  Government  that  there  is  a  need  to  make 

adequate provisions for making available loans to the poor farmers.  A demand is 

being  raised  to  provide  the  facility  of  interest  free  loans  to  the  farmers.    The 

Government should ponder over it.  I request the Government to make provisions 

for providing interest free loans to the farmers.  'NABARD' should provide loans to 

the farmers for various schemes. There should also be proper arrangements for the 

farmers for deep boring.
