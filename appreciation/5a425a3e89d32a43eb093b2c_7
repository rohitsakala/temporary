  To  resolve  the  issue  awarding  degrees  to 

the students and trainees, this Bill is necessary.  We have earned fame worldwide 

in  the  field  of  footwear  industry.    We  are  the  third  biggest  economy  in  terms  of  

footwear  and leather  industry  and  we  have  to  march  forward  from  here.   When  I 

was  the  chairman  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Tourism,  we  had  recommended 

that the government should award degrees not diplomas to the students.  Because 

the  private  colleges  and  universities  were  awarding  degree  not  diplomas.    I  think 

that  we  should  expand  the  scope  of  outreach  programme  of  the  FDDI  because 

during  the  high  end  training,  very  talented  students  who  are  not  traditionally 

associated  with  this  industry  will  also  get  such  training.    We  should  not  confine 

ourselves to trained human resources only but the availability of basic raw material 

i.e.  hide  an  skin  is  also  of  utmost  important  for  this  sector  which  we  should 

resource from the entire Asia.  A branch of this institute should also be opened in 

Panjipada, which is a long pending demand of the people there.
