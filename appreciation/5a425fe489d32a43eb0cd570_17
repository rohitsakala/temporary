  I rise to support this Bill wherein government is 

making an endeavour to give the Schedule Caste status to the remaining castes of 

Chhattisgarh,  Haryana,  Kerala,  Odisha  and  West  Bengal  state.    Through  this  Bill 

efforts  are  being  made  to  bring  the  deprived  classes  into  the  mainstream  of  the 

society.    I  feel  pride  to  say  that  various  schemes  have  been  formulated  by  the 

government through which people of deprived classes have been made self reliant.  

Under the Venture Capital Scheme people of deprived classes can create a venture 

capital  to  the  tune  of  5  lakh  rupees  to  5  crore  rupees so  as  to establish  their  own 

industry  and  instead  of  being  job  seeker  they  can  be  job  provider.    This 

government  is  commemorating  125th  birth  anniversary  of  Baba  Saheb  and 

foundation  stone  has  been  laid  on  28th  April  2015  for  the  construction  of 

International Study Center with the  cost of Rs. 2,000 crore.  Again an International 

Monument is being built with the cost of Rs. 100 crore.  This government is truly 

committed towards the betterment of the downtrodden people.
