  The  Hon.  Finance  Minister 

had,  in  his  Budget  speech  2015,  said  that  we  are  going  to  present  a  very 

comprehensive Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Amendment Bill in the House in 

order  to  tackle  the  problem  of  domestic  black-money.    Today,  by  presenting  this 

Bill  in  the  House,  he  has  not  only  taken  a  big  stride  towards  fulfilling  that 

commitment but has also created history in doing so.  The Acts related to the issue 

which had been in force, have proved to  be inadequate in provisions to tackle the 

problem.    This  Bill  very  clearly  defines  benami  transaction.    It  also  clearly  lays 

down  the  parameters  for  those  entities  who  will  be  treated  as  benami  holders  as 

also those who will not attract the provisions of this Act.   The punishment of 03 

years in the previous Act has also been amended and a provision of sentence from 

01  to  07  years  has  been  made  in  the  Act.    Besides,  there  is  also  a  provision  of 

penalizing the offender upto 25 per cent of the market value of the property.  The 

amendment  Act  also  seeks  to  provide  powers  of  civil  court  to  the  competent 

authorities.  There is also a provision of appellate court.  In conclusion, I am of this 

opinion that the kind of law  matching global standards in respect of transparency 

and  accountability  brought  by  the  Government  will  certainly  go  a  long  way  in 

tackling the problem of black-money.
