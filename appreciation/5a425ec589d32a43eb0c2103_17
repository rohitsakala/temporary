  This  government,  which  was  formed  under  the 

stewardship  of  hon.  Prime  Minister  at  a  time  when  the  developed  nations  of  the 

world were reeling under economic recession, not only saved this country but also 

continued  to  keep  it on the growth  trajectory  every  year.    I  would  like  to  request 

the hon. Finance Minister to increase a little bit the budget for national highways.  

The Prime Minister of our country is anxious about how to double the income of 

the farmers of the country.  But what the farmers of the country need first is water 

and  hence  this  needs  to  be  addressed  to  properly.    The  work  related  Sharda-

Yamuna project should be expedited.  At the same time, I would like to request the 

Government to decide minimum support prices for the agriculture produces so that 

farmers may get remunerative prices for their produces.  I would also like to urge 

that  the  Union  Government  and  State  Governments  together  should  bear  the 

expenditure incurred on the treatment of the lethal diseases like cardiac arrest and 

cancer  in  order  protect  the  people  from  such  diseases.    The  main  cause  of  these 

diseases is excessive use of chemical manure in farming.  So, the persons going for 

organic  farming  requires  to  be  incentivized.    At  last,  I  would  like  to  request  the 

hon. Finance Minister to issue such a card to the people of low income group that 

may not be liable to be taxed.
