  The  Government  has  presented  the  Union 

Budget keeping in view the agriculture and farmers welfare.  In the Union Budget 

2017-18  sufficient  funds  have  been  provided  for  flagship  schemes  in  the  field  of 

crop  insurance, irrigation, health  card  and  dairy.   In  addition to  that, provision of 

Rs.10  lakh  crore have  been  made  for  agriculture  credit in the Budget  to  facilitate 

easy  loans  to  small  and  marginal  farmers.  Moreover,  Rs.1900  crore  have  been 

provided for the computerization of primary credit cooperative institutions.  A fund 

has  been  created  for  Pradhan  Mantri  Irrigation  Scheme  under  NABARD.  

Similarly,  Rs.9,000  crore  have  been  provided  under  crop  insurance  scheme.  

Government has made provisions to tune of Rs.14,000 crore for MNREGA in the 

Union  Budget  to  increase  employment  opportunities  in  rural  areas  with  the 

objective  to  make  the  villages  prosper  and  strengthen  the  rural  economy  of  our 

country.    Under  the  Pradhan  Mantri  Awas  Yojana,  Rs.15,000  crore  have  been 

provided to construct one crore houses in the rural areas.  Similarly, Rs.4813 crore 

have been earmarked for the rural electrification.  My Parliamentary Constituency, 

Tikamgarh-Chhattarpur  had  been  reeling  under  the  drought  situation  since  many 

years.    So,  there  is  a  need  to  make  arrangements  for  long  term  disaster 

management  and  financial  security  for  providing  security  to  the  farmers  and 

workers  in  all  the  areas  of  our  country  particularly  in  Tikamgarh-Chhatarpur.    In 

addition  to  that,  there  is  an  urgent    need  to  undertake  the  work  pertaining  to 

interlinking of the      Ken-Betva river in Bundelkhand.
