  I fully support this Bill on behalf of the 

Telugu  Desam  Party.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  hon.  Minister  for  according  the 

sanction for Indian Institute of Foreign Trade and Indian Institute of Packaging in 

my  Kakinada  constituency  of  Andhra  Pradesh.  This  will  boost  employment 

generation  in  my  constituency.  The  proposed  legislation  seeks  to  facilitate  and 

promote  teaching,  training,  and  research  in  all  disciplines  relating  to  design  and 

development of footwear and leather products and to enable FDDI to emerge as a 

centre  of  excellence  meeting  international  standards.    I  would  like  to  request  the 

Government to consider setting up the FDDI in my constituency Kakinada, Andhra 

Pradesh  so  as  to  boost  the  leather industry  and  give  educational  and  employment 

opportunity to many youth of Andhra Pradesh.  I hope that this Bill will boost the 

leather industry and give educational and employment opportunity to the youth.
