  Provisions have been made 

in Article 15 and Article 39 of the constitution to provide justice and protection to 

the juvenile.  The conduct of a juvenile is a reflection of his surroundings.  But we 

should  also  analyze  as  to  why  such  situation  arised.    Our  social  values  are 

degrading,  and  our  cultural  values  are  being  attacked.    This  is  the  reason  for 

creation of such  a  situation in  our  country.   Our  juveniles  are getting involved  in 

heinous crimes. That is why efforts are being made to redress this problem through 

this  amendment.    I  am  of  the  view  that  this  should  be  the  priority  of  the 

government of any country.  I am also of the view that the juvenile should get an 

opportunity  to  be  brought  back  to  the  mainstream  of  the  society.    Several  such 

provisions  have  been  made  in  this  Bill.    Juvenile  Justice  Committee  or  Juvenile 

Justice Board will be set up in every district of the country.  These boards will have 

people  who  are  experts  in  child  psychology  or  who  are  experts  of  psychology  or 

sociology.  There will be a provision in this Bill to award punishment for crimes of 

heinous nature.  Besides provisions have also been made to protect the children in 

the age group of 14 years to 18 years, from exploitation, which is a welcome step.  

I  believe  after  enactment  of  this  Bill  full  protection  will  be  provided  to  the 

children.
