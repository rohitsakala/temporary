 

We  need  to  have  the  best  of  the  best  institutes  more  and  more  in  number  in  our 

country  which  will  do  essential  research.    When  we  pass  this  Bill,  we  will  have 

seven  IISERs  for  research  and  innovation  in  the  field  of  basic  sciences  like 

Chemistry, Biology, Earth Sciences etc.  These are all India institutes in which the 

best of the best students come from all over India to join research and innovation.  

These  two,  IISERs  which  we  will  be  enacting  today  have  already  started 

functioning in Tirupati since 2015 and in Berhampur since 2016.  First one was set 

up in Kolkata followed by Pune, Mohali, Thiruvananthapuram and others.  Now, 

we  have  added  Shibpur,  Mohali  and  Bhopal  also.    We  have  incurred  an 

expenditure  of  nearly  Rs.  4,600  crore  for  all  these  seven  IISERs.    It  is  the  real 

investment that a nation makes in its future.  Therefore, this kind of investment of 

such a large amount for so many students is necessary because we create scientists 

there.  These institutes achieve 5,746 students who are the brain and we  must be 

proud of these students.  As I have said various  courses are being run in the field 

of basic science.  More importantly, there is humanities and social science because 

we believe that just technology/science education is not enough.  The purpose of 

the education system is to bring out a good human being out of them.  Therefore, 

we must also have humanities and social science awareness in all kinds of students 

that  we produce.   Therefore,  in  IITs, IIITs  and  NITs  also  we have  done  much to 

improve the humanities faculty also.
