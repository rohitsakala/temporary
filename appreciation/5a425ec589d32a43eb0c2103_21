 This Budget is based on the philosophy of 

Ekatm  Manavvaad    while  propagating  the  idea  of  antyodaya.    Hon.  Minister  of 

Finance  has  made  a  good  initiative  to  realize  the  dreams  of  a  prosperous  India.  

The endeavours of our hon. Prime Minister based on Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas are 

yielding  good  results  to  reach  the  poorest  of  poor  of  the  society.    The  economic 

reforms have enabled us to lag behind even China.  Our government has made an 

sterling achievement in  controlling  the price  rise.   Adequate  allocation have been 

made for supporting the female entrepreneurs and those belonging to the SCs and 

STs  in  setting  up  their  own  businesses.    The  performance  of  the  previous 

government  during  their  ten  years  period  stands  nowhere  to  our  Government's 

performance of three  years.   This is not per chance but by the dint  of hard  work.  

This Government under the stewardship of our hon. Prime Minister has realised in 

these  three  years  that  a  prosperous  farmer  is  the  foundation  of  prosperous  India.  

Crores of Indians do not have roof over their heads.   Our Prime Minister has not 

only realized the gravity of this issue but has also laid down a roadmap to resolve 

this problem.
