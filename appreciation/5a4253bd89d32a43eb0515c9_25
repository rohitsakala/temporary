 I am thankful to you for giving me an opportunity to 

speak on Finance Bill 2016-17 of Uttarakhand state. History is testimony of facts 

as  to  how  provisions  of  the  Article  356  has  been  misused  and  how  one  party 

destabilised the regional parties by misusing the provision of the constitution. The 

country has seen the menace of the Emergency in 1975. The provisions of Article 

356  have  been  incorporated  in  our  constitution  in  order  to  protect  democracy.  In 

the  above  state  the  said  Article  has  been  used  to  save  the  democracy  as  the 

incumbent government has very thin majority and as many as nine MLAs among 

them  became  rebel  because  of  rampant  corruption  and  loot  there  and  a  minority 

government cannot run the government constitutionally. Therefore, the Centre has 

imposed  the  President  Rule.  The  Constitution  provides  check  and  balance  when 

such  constitutional  crisis  arises.  The  BJP  and  their  allies  who  repose  faith  in 

democracy firmly believes in strengthening of democracy in order to strengthen the 

regional parties. Accordingly, the Government has stepped in to deal the crisis and 

I support this move.
