  Be  it  providing  financial  rights  or  taxation 

rights to the states, this act is going to strengthen federal structure of the country.  

Had  this  Bill  not  introduced,  there  would  have  been  no  demarcation  between 

industrial alcohol and potable alcohol.  I think this Bill has brought a clarity in this 

matter.    Now  they  would  be  no  dispute  between  union  and  states  with  regard  to 

jurisdiction on this matter.  All of us know that there are two types of alcohol: one 

is used for human consumption and the other is used in the industries.  This act has 

brought a  set  of  rules  and    a line  of demarcation  with regard to  development  and 

regulation  of  these  two  industries.    The  passage  of  this  Bill  will  lead  to  increase 

income of both union and states.
