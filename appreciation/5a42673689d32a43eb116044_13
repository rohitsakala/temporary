    We  are  discussing  very  good  things  on  the 

125th birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.  On the occasion of the Constitution Day 

we  have  also  an  opportunity  of  introducing  a  landmark  bill.  Our  Prime  Minister 

has  given  a  gift  to  students.  They  no  more  will  have  to  bother  to  approach  a 

gazetted  officer  to  get  their  certificates  attested.  Self  attestation  will  serve  the 

purpose.    Similarly,  till  now,  pensioners,  the  senior  citizens  had  to  approach 

somebody  certifying  them  that  they  were  alive.  The  Prime  Minister  made  the 

provision  of  self-attestation  for  this  purpose.  I  hold  that  in  the  field  of  business 

also,  the  provision  of  self  attestation  or  self  certification  will  benefit  those  in 

business  and  will  have convenience  through  'Make in  India'  or  'Made in  India'. It 

will  do  away  with  the  delay  and  inconvenience  caused  by  bureaucracy  in  such 

types of affairs in the country.  We have Bisleri water bottles in the market. It has 

been found that big capitalists are selling such bottles at high cost.  By involving 

ordinary people in supplying water the Government has given good facilities to the 

people. Yesterday, the government told about edible products that it would address 

complaints of consumers and will hold inquiry into it.  So many persons frequently 

send  RTI  application  and  cause  unnecessary  harassment.    There  must  be  some 

provisions of stock checking so that such casual complaints are avoided.
