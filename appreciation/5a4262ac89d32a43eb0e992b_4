  Though  our 

forefathers 

traditionally  used  waterways  for  transportation  but    earlier  governments  did  not 

pay attention during  the last 60-65 years period on waterways except five national 

waterways.    Fortunately,    we  have  at  least  5500  km  long  coastline.    There  are 

numerous perennial rivers in the country.  Transportation cost through waterways 

is  relatively  very  low  so  cost  of  commodities  will  also  come  down.    This  will 

decrease  pollution  as  well  as  accidents.    I  request  the  Government  to  include  the 

bays in Konkan region for transportation through waterways.
