 I support this trust amendment Bill 

various  trust  have  unutilized  money.    A  way  has  been  found  how  to  utilize  such 

money  in  the  development  of  the  country.    It  is  a  welcome  step.    We  should 

reconsider the whole Bill encompassing all the provisions.  The government today 

has taken a commendable step although it took 130 years.  I thank the Government 

for taking this right step and introduced amendment to section 20 in the interest of 

the  society  and  the  country.    Section  20(A)  has  been  deleted.    In  India  there  are 

some  mutts  with  deposits  running  into  millions  of  rupees  lying  unutilized.    The 

elderly had donated their properties to the wakf and the trusts with the conviction 

that  their  money  would  be  utilized  for  the  benefit  of  the  society,  education  and 

would help the poor.
