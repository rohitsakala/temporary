 It is commendable that this Government 

has seriously taken up the long pending demand for a Constitutional body for the 

OBCs.    The  proposed  body  is  expected  to  take  care  of  the  grievance  of  the 

backward  classes.    The  new  Commission  should  be  given  powers  to  examine 

requests  for  inclusion  of  any  community  in  the  list  of  backward  classes  and  also 

hear  complaints  of  over  inclusion  and  under  inclusion.    Several  states  are  facing 

demands  and  agitations  demanding  inclusion  of  various  castes  in  the  list  of 

Backward Classes.  The Commission may adopt a scientific and rational approach 

for  inclusion  and  exclusion  of  any  caste.   The  Government  should  engage  all  the 

political parties and other sections of the society on the issue of creamy layer and 

arrive at a rational decision.  We  must encourage trade and industry so that more 

jobs  can  be  created.    I  am  sure  with  so  many  initiatives  being  taken  by  the 

Government  the  economic  development  is  on  the  right  path  and  will  result  in 

employment  creation.      I  request  the  Government  to  consider  introduction  of 

reservation for backward classes in private sector.  There are various schemes for 

the  backward  classes  but  the  implementation  of  these  schemes  is  not  proper  and 

effective.    I  request  the  Government  to  entrust  evaluation  and  implementation  of 

these  schemes  to  the  proposed  commission.    The  proposed  body  should  have 

greater  transparency  and  it  should  focus  on  the  holistic  development  and 

advancement  of  each  community  within  the  backward  classes.    The  Commission 

shall take up categorization of backward classes into 'backward', 'more backward', 

'most backward' and 'extremely backward' castes with sub-quota so as to spread the 

benefits of reservation and other social justice measures equitably.
