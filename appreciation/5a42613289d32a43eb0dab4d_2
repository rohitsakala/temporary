 This is a small amendment.  There is a proposal 

to include Sabakhiya, Sualgiri and Swalgiri - these three castes of Odisha at serial 

No.  79  in  the  list  of  Scheduled  Castes.    The  other  point  is  to  replace  the  word 

'Pondicherry'  by  the  word  'Pudducherry'.    The  Government  has  formulated  a 

number  of  schemes  for  the  welfare  of  the  poor  and  the  dalits.    I  welcome  the 

Government  for  this.    Hon.  Prime  Minister  has  declared  the  26th  November  as 

'Samvidhan  Diwas'.    It  shows  his  faith  in  the  Constitution.    I  congratulate  the 

Government  for  its  decision  to  declare  the  five  places  related  to  Baba  Saheb 

Ambedkar's  life  as  panchtirtha.      This  will  greatly  inspire  the  future  generations.  

Baba  Saheb  Ambedkar  has  written  in  his  book  'Problem  of  Rupees'  that  the 

Government  should  take  decision  of  demonetization  to  end  the  problem  of  black 

money  and  parallel  economy.    No  one  bothered  to  implement  this  idea  of  Baba 

Saheb  for  this  long  but  our  hon.  Prime  Minister, Shri  Narendra  Modi  ji.    He  had 

also said that power generation and electrification are key to progress of any state.  

This Government led by Shri Narendra Modi is following the ideals of Baba Saheb 

Ambedkar.
