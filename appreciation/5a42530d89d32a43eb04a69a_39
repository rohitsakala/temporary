 I support the Demand for Grants 2017-18. Our 

Government has focused most on agriculture related schemes for the development 

of  the  country.  Target  has  been  set  for  doubling  the  income  of  the  farmers. 

Provision  has  been  made  for  providing  complete  insurance  at  very  low  rate  of 

premium  under  Pradhan  Mantri  Fasal  Bima  Yojana.  Better  facilities  have  been 

provided  for  irrigation  under  Pradhan  Mantri  Krishi  Sinchayee  Yojana.  A  new 

channel  DD  Kisan  has  been  launched  and  facility  for  soil  testing  through  Soil 

Health Card  Scheme  has been given by  our government. A scheme  for providing 

fair price of farm produces to the farmers through National Agriculture Market has 

been introduced.
