 Had any attention been paid for 

the  constitution  of  backward  classes  Commission  when  Scheduled  Castes  and 

Scheduled  Tribes  commissions  was  constituted,  they  would  have  gone  much 

higher in terms of their economic development. But instead of going into why the 

Commission  for  the  development  of  backward  classes  was  not  constituted,  it 

should be considered that ever since this right has been given to us how shall we 

get  full  rights.  Mandal  Commission  was  constituted  in  the  year  1979.  Had  the 

recommendations  of  Mandal  Commission  been  implemented  and  reservation  in 

jobs been given, this problem would not have cropped up today. Shri V. P. Singh ji 

had  implemented  the  Mandal  Commission  and  granted  27%  reservation.  Every 

time I got an opportunity to speak about the benefits and welfare of OBC category 

I also talked about the development of villages and the welfare of the poor and the 

farmers  so  that  the  people  of  India  should  know  that  in  Bhartiya  Janta  Party  also 

such people are there who represent their point of view. In this connection we must 

thank  Shri  Narendra  Modi  Ji.  I  salute  the  tolerance  of    crores  of  OBC  of  the 

country. They were hopeful that a day will come when their voice would be heard.
