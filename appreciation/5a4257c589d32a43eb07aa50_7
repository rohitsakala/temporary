  The  Indian  Institutes  of  management 

Bill  2017  declares  20  existing  IIMs  as  institutions  of  national  importance  and 

confers on them the power to grant degrees.  The Board of Governors will be the 

executive  body  of  each  IIM,  comprising  up  to  19  members.    The  Board  of 

Governors  will  appoint  the  Director  of  each  IIM.    The  Director  is  eligible  for 

variable pay to be determined by the Board.  The Bill extends greater autonomy to 

the  Board  in  the  performance  of  these  functions.   The  only  thing  what  we  would 

also request in this is that IIM was promised in the Sate Reorganization Act.  So, 

we wish that the Government sanction us an IIM also.
