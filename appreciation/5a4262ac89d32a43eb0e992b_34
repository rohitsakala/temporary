    Waterways  from  Allahabad  to  Howrah  is 

very  old.  Farmers  their  agricultural  produce  through  this  way  from  one  place  to 

another.    Desi  ghee  is  produced  and  taken  to  eastern  Uttar  Pradesh  through  this 

way. Transportation of ghee is done on this waterways which goes to Bengal. This 

Bill  has  been  introduced  with  some  objective.  Small  farmers,  labourer  and  other 

people will get benefit from this. I would like to request the transport Minister that 

Bhadchi  used  be  a  centre  for  transportation  of  goods.  I  would  like  to  inform  that 

ghee  used  to  be  transported  to  Gazipur,  Bananas,  Ballia,  Bhadchi  and  Allahabd.  

Special arrangement should be done, a station should be developed by waterways 

system.
