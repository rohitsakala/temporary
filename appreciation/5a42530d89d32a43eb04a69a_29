  A  number  of 

schemes have been implemented for the benefit of farmers. This would be helpful 

in increasing the income of farmers. It has been decided to make the Krishi Vigyan 

Kendras more modern and facility for soil testing by way of Soil Health Card has 

been made available in these Kendras. Efforts have been made to make more and 

more area of land irrigated by launching Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana 

to  double  the  farm  productivity.  Pradhan  Mantri  Fasal  Bima  Yojana  is  a  historic 

scheme.  A  farmer  can  sell  his  crop  through  e-mandi  anywhere  and  can  get  fair 

price.  The  Government  of  India  has  taken  the  historic  decision  of  introducing 

Neem coated urea. The decision for development of Animal Husbandry and Dairy 

development to bring white revolution across the country is commendable.
