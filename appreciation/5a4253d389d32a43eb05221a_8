 The laws which were enacted in the 

year  1840  are  still  in  practice  even  after  independence  in  our  country.    The  ill-

effects  of  such  laws  had  to  bear  by  fishermen  living  near  coastal  areas,  vessel 

owners  and  people  engaged  in  trading  through  sea  routes.    We  cannot  draw 

boundary line in seas and also cannot erect fencing so the fishermen used to cross 

beyond 12 nautical miles at places.  The big vessels of foreign countries used to do 

huge harm to our fishermen and flee after harming them.  Now this Bill will put a 

check  on  such  acts  in  future.    Earlier,  our  fishermen  and  traders  had  to  face 

problems in submitting their claims as they were totally in a fix as to where to go 

for this. Now this Bill has sorted out all these problems.  The Government needs to 

focus  more  on  giving  priority  to  maritime  claims.    Many  such  claims  have  been 

lying  pending  for  years  together.    With  the  passage  of  this  Bill,  the  Government 

needs  to  dispose  of  these  maritime  claims  expeditiously  by  giving  them  first 

priority.    Now  the  Government  is  also  empowered  to  restrict  the  entry  of  vessels 

coming from other countries and provide protection to our fishermen by properly 

implementing the provisions provided in the Bill.  Lastly, I would like to say that 

the  Government  has  fulfilled  the  long  pending  demand  of  our  fishermen  through 

this Bill.
